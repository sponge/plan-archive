//========== November 11 ==============
Nothing new, just cleaned out old stuff.

//== Some stuff that I think is cool ==

Luck is where preparation meets opportunity.
(Neil Peart, A Work In Progress)

//=====================================

It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion,
It is by the beans of Java that thoughts acquire speed,
The hands acquire shaking, the shaking becomes a warning,
It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion.

(Spin on passage from Dune: Unknown Author)

//=====================================

Here is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump, bump on the
back of his head, behind Christopher Robin.
It is, as far as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,
but sometimes he feels that there really is another way,
if only he could stop bumping his head for a moment and think of it.
And then he feels that perhaps there isn't.

(A.A. Milne)

You can't give it.
You can't even buy it.
You just don't... get it.

Night Patterns

The coffee mug etched black inside
haunts the worn gray keys. The computer screen
amused perlwhite lights the developer's hands
and his night still life: pencils and books, scattered
pages of code circled and crossed with notes.
Outside, along the river, white headlights flow,
red lights retreat.

Inside the agile black box it waits-the conjuring
that lifts alive vined parts,
veins flowing in forces he imagines
by circles and crosses, in dozing spells,
in whitened warmth upon noon earth,
in peach trees by the wall-
it waits to pulse the pages
toward life, the patterns of night, to bring
the quality, singing soft and hanging low.
