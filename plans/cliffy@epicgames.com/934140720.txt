---------------------------------------------------

Sorry about the constant Kenn Hoekstra-esque plan updates, but I forgot
to mention that everyone should go see "The Iron Giant," because it is
a fantastic movie. I was smiling for 90% of the movie and weepy for the
other 10%.

(this, from the guy who cried when Optimus Prime died.)

----------------------------------------
You know you have made it when The Misanthropic Bitch rags on you.

LOL

Everyone needs to see the new Weird Al video.

"If I ever meet you I'd control-alt-delete you!"

Finally, Hellmouth is live. Check it out, some good reads...

http://www.hellmouth.org


---------------------------------------------------
There are 2 kinds of people in this world.

Those who "get" and love "The Blair Witch Project...."

And those who are Dumb.

Developers could learn a lesson or two from this movie
on how to create real fear. Someone once said
"When the creaky door opens, and the lightning flashes, 
and there's a ten-foot bug in front of you, part of you 
is relieved, and thinks, "Man, I thought it was going 
to be a TWENTY-FOOT bug."

Sometimes what you DON'T show is scariest.

Anyways, I'm still looking for stories for my Hellmouth
site's launch. (see information in previous update)




---------------------------------------------------
Yes, developers have hobbies too.

Shortly I will be launching the follow up to the Cat Scan contest.

www.hellmouth.org

This website will be a venting board for anyone who has endured abuse
while in school. It doesn't matter when it happened, yesterday or 20
years ago, I want to hear it.

You can email your stories to me.

cliff@epicgames.com

Ideal length is a page or more, but I'll probably take more or less.

I know there are thousands of stories out there. Share them.

We spanked the Worldstats guys. It was fun. =)

http://UT.ngworldstats.com/games/team/209.242.102.21/7777/932004098490/

Looks like they didn't know where the Damage Amplifier is.

In other news, you should go out and buy LUNAR for the PSX.
One of the best RPG's of all time.

For those of you who give a fuck, here are my favourite 
movies of all time, in no particular order.

Jacob's Ladder
Heathers
From Dusk Til Dawn
Aliens
The Matrix
The Big Lebowski
Weird Science
John Carpenter's The Thing
The Usual Suspects
Seven
Jerry MacGuire
Evil Dead 2
Swimming With Sharks
Shawshank Redemption
Apocolypse Now
Full Metal Jacket
Candyman

As we're testing UT we're also testing ngWorldStats. You can see realtime
updates of our office stats at this URL:

http://ut.ngworldstats.com

Here, you can see the overall stats of who is best at the office, or who
survives the longest during games, who prefers what weapons, etc... All
in real time! Yes, as we play more and more you'll see these stats change
and you can drool over the day your name will be in lights.

Note: The shock rifle currently leads the weapon balancing stats due to
the "InstaGib" mutator that Brandon put in which changes the gametype to
one shot kills with the Shock Rifle. (We've been playing FAR too much of
that and lowgrav...)

Notice who leads the pack baby. Aaaaaaw yeah.

BTW, Austin Powers 2 sucked.




---------------
Kudos to the homies over at Legend for completing their most excellent
Unreal level pack "Return to Na Pali." I have played this pack several
times, and it more than holds up to the orginal Unreal, in many ways 
exceeding it in ass kicking gameplay and visual splendor.

For more information on "Return," check out the website:

http://www.gtinteractive.com/unreal/missionpack/

In other news, I really found this article amusing:

http://www.fgnonline.com/news/7536.html

Demis, when the Music and Cinema biz reached the Mass Market all the
sex and violence virtually up and vanished!

"With the growth of DVD the nature of games will change, Hassabis 
argues, as consumers who use DVD for films and music will not be 
interested in blowing the heads off people. They will obviously want
his combination of strategy and simulation, sending poor old Lara 
Croft into retirement."

Demis, I seriously doubt that Lara will be retiring any time soon.

There is always room for the Theme Parks and Tomb Raiders in this world.



---------------
Heads up, everyone, looks like a truly ass kicking movie is on its way
to theaters:

http://www.blairwitch.com
http://www.artisanent.com/blairwitch/trailer2.mov
http://www.blairwitch.com/aicn.mov

Some are calling "The Blair Witch Project" the scariest movie since
"The Exorcist." I know I'll be first in line to see it.

The last time I was this stoked about a movie it was The Matrix. :)

Speaking of movies, allow me to pimp the UT movie that Mark and I put
together one more time:

As if you care, I'm listening to:

The Outhere Bros
RENT
A Chorus Line

[UNREAL TOURNAMENT MOVIE UPDATE]

The one time I get cocky it turns out the file is b0rked.

http://www.planetunreal.com/dl/dl.asp?official/ut1.zip

Try that one, kids.





----------------------
Unfortunately, no one can be told what Unreal Tournament 
is. You have to see it for yourself.

ftp://download2.gamespy.com/demos/action/ut1.zip

Took Mark and I a while to put this movie together, 
and we're rather proud of it. 

Go.

Download.

Spooge.

So, I get this email last night at 2am:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER SEASON FINALE TO BE DELAYED UNTIL LATER IN THE
SUMMER

Burbank, CA (May 24, 1999) -- The season finale of the highly acclaimed
one-hour series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER titled Graduation Day, Part
Two, which was scheduled to air tomorrow night, Tuesday, May 25, 1999,
will be delayed until later in the summer, it was announced today by
Jamie Kellner, CEO of The WB.  In its place, The WB will air an encore
episode of the series titled Band Candy.

The following statement was made by Jamie Kellner.

It is out of sympathy and compassion for the families and communities
that have been devastated by the recent senseless acts of violence
perpetrated on high school campuses that we have decided to delay this
broadcast.  Our decision is also borne out of a deep sense of
responsibility to The WBs loyal young audience.

At issue for us was a short part of the climactic scene of this
powerful two-part season finale.  During a solar eclipse that occurs
during his commencement speech at Sunnydale Highs graduation ceremony,
the mayor morphs into a 60-foot serpent and attacks the students.  In
turn, Buffy and her classmates are forced to defend themselves.  Given
the current climate, depicting acts of violence at a high school
graduation ceremony, even fantasy acts against 60-foot serpents and
vampires, we believe, is inappropriate to broadcast around the actual
dates of these time-honored ceremonies.

We apologize to the millions of loyal Buffy viewers who are eagerly
anticipating this episode.  We sincerely hope that you understand that
the last thing we want to do is pre-empt our season finale.  However, at
this time, we feel that it is the best and most responsible decision for
us to make.

Like most of its loyal fans and the nations critics, we at The WB
consider BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER to be one of the highest quality
programs on television today.  We plan on being able to broadcast
Graduation Day, Parts One and Two later in the summer.  Next season,
Buffy and her cohorts, having graduated from high school, will be
involved in their greatest adventures ever.
---

What a steaming crock of dogshit. There are only a few good shows on TV,
and Buffy is the cream of the crop. Television suits are a bunch of
spineless sissies.

I've seen a lot of Jar Jar hatred on the net lately.

If you ask me...

Jar Jar Binks was the most HUMAN of all the characters, actors, and aliens
in Episode 1. The rest of the actors were stiff and robotic.

Which is extremely ironic, seeing as the CG character out-performed the
"real" actors.

Guys, the movie isn't going to be ALIENS. It is a kiddie popcorn Saturday
Matinee Bubblegum fable. Jar Jar was charming and full of life and the 
most memorable being in the film.

Darth Maul may have been interesting, had he more than a cameo in 
the picture.






------------------------
On Monday I purchased several action figures from the new 
"Star Wars" line, including Obi Wan Kenobi.

I also purchased "Dessicator" from McFarlane toys.

Both were purchased at a gaming store in the local mall.

www.cliffyb.com/actionfigures.jpg

Here we see the two action figures side by side.

Dessicator-> $12.99
Obi Wan-> $9.99

Now, is it just me or is there a major difference between
the quality of these two figures?

The new star wars action figures suck. The old ones sucked,
and the new ones continue that fabulous tradition of suckage.

They're not even as cool as GI Joes that were released 10+
years ago. 

Hey, Lucas, ever hear of KUNG FU GRIP?

[Now, I know there are "deluxe" Star Wars figures available, 
but my point here is that I'm getting 10x more value for a 
mere 3 dollars from McFarlane Toys.]





--------------------------------------------
Yesterday we released a screenshot of a bunch of our UT characters.

http://www.bluesnews.com/screenshots/ut/utshot1.shtml

Many people, in emails and messageboards, are claiming that the guys in
this picture are not meshes, and are just skins.

THIS IS NOT TRUE. The characters in this picture are ACTUAL IN GAME
MODELS, texture mapped, and ready to go. Notice the lack of stretching
or mirroring. Yes, they do look that good.

Suck on it.

Random Musings

In Britney Spears' "One More Time" video, why does the school bell ring
*after* three o'clock?

Why hasn't anyone made a class based mod like Team Fortress where the 
classes are the Village People?

When the hell IS Lunar Complete coming out on PSX?

At a flea market the other day I was able to find the original Ninja
Gaiden and Excitebike. I was stoked. I can't locate Chrono Trigger
anywhere, though, anyone have a copy they want to loan me?


-------------------
I beat Silent Hill today.

What, exactly the fuck, was that story about? Can someone point me to a
summary that explains it, because it really made little sense to me. I
got the good+ ending, FYI.

Websites should be back up shortly, thanks to Mek.






----------------

Kudos to Xatrix Entertainment for having the most enormous cajhones in the
gaming business.

What a brilliant product.

In other news, this was one hell of a GDC. My head still hurts.



-------
Well, I'm off to GDC in the morning with Pancho. Looking forward to seeing everyone there and having a good time. Oh, and I'm hoping to learn a thing or two also. =)

We'll be showing UT at various hardware vendors' booths, I'll be there often to open up a can of whup-ass on all who dare step. Hee hee!

Make sure you stop by the roundtable I'm hosting as well as the panel I'm participating in!

Republica
Bust a Groove Soundtrack
TOOL
Korn ADIDAS single remix (over and over again...how true is that song?)

***Why Deer Hunter and Barbie Fashion Designer are good for us***

1. These people would not have purchased our games to begin with. Their
interests lie in hunting or dolls, not aliens and swordplay.

2. These games are "gateway games" to other genres, to "real" games. They
reduce the "intimidation factor" that computers carry with them. Perhaps
once the rednecks get tired of the hunting games they'll be interested in
some real software. When the girls who are playing Barbie get older perhaps
they'll graduate to big guns and Deathmatch.

3. They're creating even more genres for the industry that help it to
appeal to a wider consumer base. Notice how the music biz has product that
appeals to everyone, music from Shania Twain to Ice T to Barenaked Ladies.
Until recently we haven't seen a lot of games that have appealed to people
outside of our little geek circle, and the market is being cracked wide open.

4. Companies are making more money off of these games, if a publisher like
GT makes a lot of money off of Deer Hunter II then they'll still be around
to publish your game if you do the solo thing.

5. More market penetration. Games are in sporting goods stores and the
Barbie section of Toys R Us, keeping the concept of PC entertainment in the
heads of people everywhere. Getting into stores besides EB and Babbages is
a good thing. I know people who wouldn't be caught dead in a gaming
specialty store.

Do not fear this renaissance. Embrace it, my geeky brethren.

Non game related anecdote:

Okay, so last night on the way to see 8MM (pretty good movie) my Fiancee'
and I stopped by the local supermarket to get some beer. We go up to the
register and I put down the beer and the lady asks for my ID so I show it.
She then says "I can't sell this to you unless I see both of your ID's."

My Fiancee' isn't 21 yet, even if she was she didn't bring her ID with her,
so I said "Okay, honey, go wait in the car while I buy this." and the clerk
says "No, I saw you two come in here, and I can't sell it to you."

So, when did this happy horse shit start? What happens if a father goes to
the market with his 5 year old son? What if it is a hot day and he needs to
do some shopping, is he going to leave his kid in a sweltering car where he
can be abducted or fry? I don't think so.

I can remember dozens of times before I was 21 that I went to the market
with my mother and she purchased wine or liquor. No trouble there.

It's not like this is going to stop underage drinking. We simply went to
another supermarket and she waited in the car. Big deal.

And why can't you buy beer after 2am? This impedes the nightlife in Raleigh
as well... you go out at 11pm to party and you're supposed to be done by
2am? You're not even buzzed by then!

Brandon "Greenmarine" Reinhart posted this to our messageboard
(megaboard.epicgames.com) and I think it says a lot about UT:

	"I think its really important to reiterate that UT isn't just multiplayer.
I've been spending a lot of time working out the code and story for the
single player side of the game. You don't have to have a net connection to
enjoy UT, you don't have to play online.
The single player game consists of a ladder through each of the four game
types, plus a special ladder at the end. Every map has a bit of story that
describes how the various environments fit together. Before entering a team
game you have a chance to customize your team and view the bio's for enemy
bots.
The bio's are very cool. You might run into a criminal from the Mars Prison
Colonies who is a total psycho. His description will tell you that he
enjoys close quarter fighting...likes to rip his enemies up and when you
play against him he'll move in close with the Impact Hammer. Or maybe<b
