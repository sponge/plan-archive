Brandon "Greenmarine" Reinhart posted this to our messageboard
(megaboard.epicgames.com) and I think it says a lot about UT:

	"I think its really important to reiterate that UT isn't just multiplayer.
I've been spending a lot of time working out the code and story for the
single player side of the game. You don't have to have a net connection to
enjoy UT, you don't have to play online.
The single player game consists of a ladder through each of the four game
types, plus a special ladder at the end. Every map has a bit of story that
describes how the various environments fit together. Before entering a team
game you have a chance to customize your team and view the bio's for enemy
bots.
The bio's are very cool. You might run into a criminal from the Mars Prison
Colonies who is a total psycho. His description will tell you that he
enjoys close quarter fighting...likes to rip his enemies up and when you
play against him he'll move in close with the Impact Hammer. Or maybe
you'll run into one of the Necris Phayder. The Necris are a new race
(human, but with dead pale skin) who are attempting to destabilize the New
Earth Government through guerilla warfare. The Phayder are a dangerous
secret society of Necris assassins.
	The bot combat in Unreal Tournament isn't just a training mode. Its an
actual single player game. Sure, you aren't running through the normal
single player environments, but you are playing an organized series of
games. Each match has a bit of story behind it. (More than, say, a Mortal
Kombat match.)
	The skill levels in UT are very controllable. If you really suck at
deathmatch you can play on the lowest skill level and feel like a frag
master. We've also included tutorials for every gametype (including
deathmatch) to get people started. Of course, if you are a badass, you'll
be hard pressed to beat the game on the hardest skill level.
	Anyway, I thought I'd take a chance to describe exactly what that side of
UT was. Since it doesn't really get attention from the various news sites.
If you have any questions feel free to ask.
Oh, one other thing. For team games in the single player where bots are on
your side, there is an orders menu that lets you deploy the bots as you see
fit. You can tell them to guard specific locations or general tasks like
"roam and attack." 


-In other news, Kingpin looks BADASS. I'll be buying that mofo.
-I'll be at the GDC in San Jose on March 15th. I'll be doing a roundtable
on where the hell 3d shooter gameplay is going, as well as speaking on a
panel hosted by Romero and some other talented individuals on where level
design is going. Feel free to stop by and say "hi!"

Ever look at Quakefinger and go

"Who the fuck *are* these guys?" 

=)

Moving on...

Raleigh cops have nothing better to do than pull people over all fucking
day long. I swear, every night to and from work I'm either getting pulled
over or I see at least 2-3 cruisers that have pulled some poor sap over.
Guess that's the sign of a low crime rate- they're not busy dealing with
shootings or rapes. :o

I saw a picture of a woman using a cactus in an interesting manner tonight.
My life has changed forever.

UT has the coolest melee weapon I've ever seen.

If this movie looked any cooler, my eyeballs would be frozen.

[Jesus, you never realize how much you miss the 'net until you're without
it at work. Living without and then getting a T1 is like coming in from
the cold into a nice, warm bath...aaaah, Bandwidth!]

::shifting gears::

Some comparisons between the gaming biz and the porno industry:

-There are fine, half naked women at our conventions.
-We have a problem with our boxes being too large and taking up too much
shelf space.
-We both dominate the 'net...it seems you can't swing a dead cat online
without hitting a gaming or porno site.
-We make a lot of money.
-No matter how much we try we can't seem to explain to our families what,
exactly, the fuck we do all day long.
-Compared to other media types, ours cost 2x too much. Games and porn 
are usually 40+ dollars, while CD's or mainstream films are usually 
20$ or under.
-You tend to find the same types of guys in Electronics Boutique as you
find in The Toy Box.
-We're something that everyone enjoys but not everyone admits to.
-We're both struggling to tell a good storyline when all everyone
really cares about is the ACTION.

***Random Musings***

When are those great fantasy movies coming back to the big screen, 
anyways? Movies like Legend, Labyrinth, etc... would be much cooler with
today's state of the art FX.

Is it just me or are television ads for games getting better and better 
and print ads for games are still getting worse? If I see one more print
ad with some mention about "Your Stick" or "Your Gun" with the lead 
programmer's mediocre looking sister in a Gap dress I think I'm going 
to claw my eyeballs out.

We wonder why this industry gets about as much respect as the porno biz.

Oh, one final thing- the new RazorJack in UT is feckin' cool, a 
futuristic version of the gun, very nice. I wanted the team to call it 
the LaserJack, but they all felt it sounded like a Gay Disco.

Y! M! C! A!

Ahem.

Bust a Groove is the most charming game I've seen since Parappa the
Rapper. The characters are all great and the tunes are fantastic. Pick
it up.

Shifting gears- I swear that the SUPER HAPPY UNREAL MAP PACK will be 
released any moment- this FREE map pack includes:

*DM-cybrosis- Skaarj base deathmatch with neato jumping pads by Alan 
Willard. Well built with a nice flow.

*DM-twilight- Skycity run and gun with lots of traps by Jeremy War.

*DM-mojo- Sequel to CURSE, tight and fast DM by yours truly. 

*DM-letting- BLOOD LETTING by Myscha, one of my all time favourites.
No where to hide on this one.

*DM-shrapnel- Extremely tight industrial DM by me, my favourite of my DM
maps IMO.

Servers, please cycle these bad boys from now on and let's move on from
Deck16 and Curse. ;)
