Psyduck has taken over our office.

I deny all knowledge of the following formal complaint, filed several days ago by one of the Epic artists:

---------------------------------------------To Tim Sweeney,
                             I would like to file a formal complaint regarding employee psychological abuse at Epicgames. Because of person(s) unknown who work at Epicgames and yellow mechanical squeaking robo ducks I cannot sleep at night, can't consume dairy products, can't feed the ducks at the lake anymore, have seizures when I see the color yellow, have become incredibly paranoid, starting to hate toys, chronic anxiety attacks, self consciousness about my hair, have recurring nightmares of the Aliens from Mars Attacks, and finally I can't stop twitching.

Among the suspected for these crimes

First and foremost:

Cliffy Be
Alan Dillard

Theres a good possibility John Mullet is an accomplice. But I cannot confirm
this as of yet.

Well, okay, maybe I did make fun of his hair. But I know nothing about the mechanical Psyducks that are popping up around the office.

I think Psyduck is a cute, lovable character from the beautiful world of Pokemon. I mean, hes a PSYCHIC DUCK. How can you beat that?

So, these BARBARIANS decided to deal with one of the mystery ducks that appeared in their office in a rather mob-like manner

And now the bastards are threatening my Transformers collection!

Id like to file a formal complaint of Pokemon Abuse with the Powers that Be at Nintendo. Psyduck should NOT be treated in this manner!

Little yellow fucker should have seen it coming, though. He IS psychic.
