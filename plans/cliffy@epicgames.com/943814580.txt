I enjoy perusing the forums where UT gamers get to 
voice their opinions. I consider it part of my job as well.

However, I feel the need to clarify some confusion that 
I've noticed in regards to the maps that we chose to ship 
with in UT.

Give me a chance to address some of these concerns, and 
use my plan file for Good.

1. "Just because you make a spaceship or a boat doesn't 
mean it plays well!"

You seem more Old School. I'd suggest playing the 
following maps then:

DM-Zeto
DM-Deck16][
DM-Grinder
DM-Codex
DM-Curse][
DM-Turbine
DM-Liandri
DM-Pressure
DM-Tempest

These are maps that were made just for the gameplay, the 
architecture is dictated by the gameplay. These maps are 
more traditional, mazey DM.

2. "These maps are bland! I don't want a cramped mazey 
bland area; been there done that! Show me something new!"

I'd suggest playing the following maps then:

DM-Gothic
DM-Hyperblast
DM-KGalleon
DM-Peak
DM-Barricade
DM-Phobos
DM-Morpheus
DM-Conveyor

The Unreal Engine handles interior and exterior 
spaces extremely well and maps like Peak and 
Hyperblast really take advantage of this. These 
maps are original, you get to frag in really 
exquisite environments. Sure, they may not be 
the ones you play in a tourney, but they sure 
have that "wow" factor.

3. "These CTF maps aren't symmetrical! These 
CTF maps are too tight!"

The issue of symmetry is something we really 
beat ourselves up over when making the UT maps. 
At the end of the day we went with a mixed 
selection; some maps were symmetrical while 
others weren't. The asymmetrical maps required 
a ton of testing and we feel that they're pretty 
well balanced. For instance, in CTF-Command the 
blue base has a slow lift and long ramp to get 
to the flag, but there's a back entrance you can 
access fairly easily if you're good with the 
translocator. In CTF-November there's a long 
winding staircase to the blue base, but once you 
get the flag you can just drop right out of it. 
In the red base there's a long pipe leading to 
the flag that you have to run through to get in 
and out of the base.

If you'd prefer more open CTF maps then I'd suggest:

CTF-Face and CTF-LavaGiant

These maps also play extremely well in low-gravity 
mode. Remember, dodging is very useful in low-grav. 
You can zip around maps easily using it.

Oh, also, server admins: Please don't run TURBO 
assault servers. It kind of kills the point of the 
game where you can destroy the assault target in 8 
seconds flat. :P

One of the reasons we wound up with over 50 maps in 
UT (besides having some really hard working level 
designers) is because we wanted to make sure we 
appealed to the broadest audience possible. Some 
people like the gimmicky maps, others like the more 
traditional DM maps, others prefer to fight in realistic 
locations. It's all there! If you don't like playing 
one kind of map then give the game a minute as the server 
will cycle to one you probably dig.

Hard to please all of the people some of the time or some 
of the people all of the time.

p.s. Dig this:

------------------------------------------

Something is really distressing me when I browse the server
list in Ubrowser in UT.

Many server admins think that just because a map shipped 
with the game that it is ok for dozens of players to play
at once.

Deathmatch maps like "Fractal," "Oblivion," and "Stalwart" are TINY and
are meant for one on one, no more. When you run a server with
a 32 player limit and add these maps to your cycle list you're
just ruining the play experience for those who are trying to 
find a good local server.

CTF maps like "Niven" are meant for 2 on 2 or 3 on 3 CTF, 
nothing more. They're not even in the default map list, this
is for a REASON!

So, please, don't cycle these maps unless you're keeping your
max players very low.

Thanks

A lot of people have asked me where I got my p1mp necklace.

Clay from QVT made it for me, custom job!

We're considering having Clay make more depending on demand.

[I thought it never rained in Dallas BTW.]

Updated UT demo is out.

http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?file=29108

PATCH from last version:
http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?file=29107

In addition to oodles of misc. improvements, 
(new pulse skin, menu changes, optimizations, etc...)
Steve has also increased the player's drawscale 
slightly as well as their ambient brightness.

Notice how much easier players are to see now.

In other news, check out the addition to my office:

Idina Menzel...great stuff. She played Maureen in "Rent"
on Broadway and boy can that girl carry a tune.

I don't know whether or not I'm more excited or disturbed by the fact
that Blue and Loonyboi are ahead of me in NGworldstats.

Yes, you too can run an Unreal Tournament Demo Server!

http://unreal.epicgames.com/DemoServers.htm

We're bottlenecking on servers out there... the servers that are up are
spilling over with gibbage... host a game! Be a l33t UT p1mp! Help us
out! I'll let you touch my shiny shirt at e3 next year! =)

For those of you who are curious- you can adjust the gamespeed to crank
up the action in UT. You can also adjust the amount of Air Control...

These features are great to add variety to your game!



--------
Okay, here are a few gameplay related notes on the demo that should help 
you whup ass like I do around here. :)

Weapons
-------
-Translocator
	This is on by default in CTF and Domination. If you want, you 
can turn it on for deathmatch when you start a server or a practice 
session. You can use it to get to hard to reach spots, telefragging 
opponents, or you can just leave it in a spot you want to return to 
later. Once you translocate, you can switch back to your previously 
selected weapon by doing the following: When you hit ALT FIRE to 
translocate, keep it held down. While it is held, you'll translocate, 
then hit regular fire again. You'll switch back to your last weapon 
right away.

-Impact Hammer
	The Melee weapon. The regular fire charges up as you hold it. 
Simply keep the button held and walk up to and touch someone (while 
still holding the button, it takes 2-3 seconds to get to a full 
charge.) This will cause serious damage. If they're wounded or are 
lacking armour, chances are you'll kill 'em. You can use the regular 
fire to "impact jump" to higher areas at the risk of some damage. 
Simply charge the tool, look down, jump and release.
	The alt fire can deflect non-trace (hitscan) projectiles if 
you time it right. It also damages foes but is more useful for 
defense rather than offense.

-Enforcer(s)
	It is a handgun. (duh) Regular fire is slower but more accurate, 
alt fire is less accurate but faster. You can get 2 of them for John 
Woo action. They suddenly become VERY useful at that point.

-Shock Rifle
	Similar to the ASMD- the gun is INSTANT HIT, even though the 
effect sears the air after the shot fires through. Regular fire does a 
good amount of damage and imparts a LOT of momentum on foes. If you are 
playing DM-MORPHEUS, it is very useful for knocking people off the 
skyscrapers. Alt-fire shoots slower moving plasma balls. You can combo 
this like in Unreal1 by shooting the alt fire blob with the regular fire.


-Minigun
	Regular fire- more accurate, slower, alt fire- less accurate, 
faster. Eats up a lot of ammo. Pretty useful when you have the Damage 
Amp. ("Udamage.")


-Pulse Gun
	Regular fire- fast firing plasma balls. Very strong, but you 
have to lead your targets. Alt fire- Lighting shaft of plasma. Has a 
limited range but is very useful, especially with the Udamage. It is 
like a knife through butter when you have the Udamage and use the 
altfire.

-Rocket Launcher
	Regular fire- fires rockets, hold button for up to 6, at which 
point it auto-releases. Alt fire lobs grenades, you can hold the 
button on this mode as well. IMPORTANT- If you are one of those who do 
not like this feature, you can turn it off now under 
OPTIONS-PREFERENCES-INPUT. However, bear in mind that those who learn 
and get used to the way the gun works will probably smear you. If you 
keep your crosshair on a foe then it will turn red and a beep will 
sound. Your rocket(s) are now homing, so let em fly. Finally, if you 
start loading up regular rockets and you hit the alt fire button while 
you're doing this your rockets will be released in a tight pattern 
instead of fanning out.

Gameplay
--------

-Dodging defaults to on. You can easily turn it off. I'd suggest 
getting used to it. It took me a couple of months during Unreal1's 
development, and now that I'm used to it I don't fall into lava or 
dodge accidentally. I use it well and I'm able to escape attacks quickly.
Bear in mind that dodging in low gravity will give you great momentum,
it is an easy way to zip around. Also, Dodging forward will make you 
flip forward.

-Feigndeath is bind-able in the regular menus. When you are faking, 
your name will not show up on other people's HUD's when they have their 
crosshairs on you. Oh, and remember, feigning death with the shieldbelt 
on is just dumb.

-Throw weapon is very useful in team games. You can bind this in the 
menus as well. When you hit this key you'll throw your current weapon 
out... use it to hook up your buddies with guns. It also has other 
interesting functions- one time in a firefight Alan was coming after me 
and I threw my gun into his hand (the Flak Cannon, it has a longer 
weapon switch time than many of the other guns) and I was able to blast 
him while he was confused and switching. It was like an action movie 
where one guy throws his gun to the other guy, says "catch" and shoots 
him. :)

-Weapon Prioritization is in the main menus and is very easy to 
navigate. Just drag your fav gun to the top, and the gun you like the 
least to the bottom. You can prioritize the translocator and impact 
hammer as well. I'd suggest making use of the SWITCH BEST WEAPON binding 
option, as this will switch to your highest priority weapon in your 
priority list when you press it. Very useful. [This is also another 
way to put the translocator away once you teleport.]

MAPS
----

-Map cycle lists
The default deathmatch map cycle list cycles Phobos and Turbine. 
Morpheus is a wide open low grav map that may not run as well as 
the other 2 maps online, and if you want to cycle it you'll need to
modify the map list when you're starting your server/practice session.

Phobos

-Jump boots are extremely useful in this space station map. 
-The central courtyard is one big clusterfuck, and if you go for the 
hidden shieldbelt down there you'll need those boots to high tail it 
to a higher level. 
-There are another pair of jump boots out near the armour/health 
vials/minigun, and you can use those to jump up on the outside of the 
space station and surprise foes. 
-Also, remember that you can "lift jump" in UT. It works like this- 
when riding a lift, and it is almost at the top, hit JUMP and you'll 
catch a lot of extra air. 
-If someone is controlling the tower in Phobos where the Damage Amp 
is, you can lift ju
