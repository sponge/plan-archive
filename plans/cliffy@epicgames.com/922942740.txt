Shane Caudle, Brandon "GreenMarine" Reinhart, and Steve Polge and myself
are all now leaving Epic Games to pursue other endeavors.

We wish Mark, Tim, James, and everyone else the best of luck at Epic.

We evaluated what we should be doing, where technology was going, and we
came to one conclusion. We should make games for one of the largest
installed hardware bases in the world.



We are naming our new company "Boys at Play." Shane saw a sign that
said that in Amsterdam, and we liked it for a company name.



We shall immediately begin making our first title:



"GIRLZ N GUNZ" on the Colour Gameboy.







...


(oh, and April Fools, biatch. hee hee)


In other news, I MADE THE CALL ON THE MATRIX. IT RULES!


-------------------
I beat Silent Hill today.

What, exactly the fuck, was that story about? Can someone point me to a
summary that explains it, because it really made little sense to me. I
got the good+ ending, FYI.

Websites should be back up shortly, thanks to Mek.






----------------

Kudos to Xatrix Entertainment for having the most enormous cajhones in the
gaming business.

What a brilliant product.

In other news, this was one hell of a GDC. My head still hurts.



-------
Well, I'm off to GDC in the morning with Pancho. Looking forward to seeing everyone there and having a good time. Oh, and I'm hoping to learn a thing or two also. =)

We'll be showing UT at various hardware vendors' booths, I'll be there often to open up a can of whup-ass on all who dare step. Hee hee!

Make sure you stop by the roundtable I'm hosting as well as the panel I'm participating in!

-Where the Hell is 3D Shooter Gameplay Going?
3/17, 10:00 - 11:00 am (San Carlos I, Hilton)

-Where the Hell is 3D Shooter Gameplay Going?
3/18, 3:30 - 4:30 (Plaza Room, Hilton)

-The Future of 3D Level Design: Technique and Philosophy
3/19, 11:30 - 12:30 (J2, Convention Center)
Panel hosted by Romero with some very notable level designers

p.s. Since Joe Siegler does it all the time, maybe I'll let you in on what music I'm into lately:

Concrete Blonde (anything and everything of theirs..they rule)
Busta Rhymes (he's the SHIT)
Republica
Bust a Groove Soundtrack
TOOL
Korn ADIDAS single remix (over and over again...how true is that song?)

***Why Deer Hunter and Barbie Fashion Designer are good for us***

1. These people would not have purchased our games to begin with. Their
interests lie in hunting or dolls, not aliens and swordplay.

2. These games are "gateway games" to other genres, to "real" games. They
reduce the "intimidation factor" that computers carry with them. Perhaps
once the rednecks get tired of the hunting games they'll be interested in
some real software. When the girls who are playing Barbie get older perhaps
they'll graduate to big guns and Deathmatch.

3. They're creating even more genres for the industry that help it to
appeal to a wider consumer base. Notice how the music biz has product that
appeals to everyone, music from Shania Twain to Ice T to Barenaked Ladies.
Until recently we haven't seen a lot of games that have appealed to people
outside of our little geek circle, and the market is being cracked wide open.

4. Companies are making more money off of these games, if a publisher like
GT makes a lot of money off of Deer Hunter II then they'll still be around
to publish your game if you do the solo thing.

5. More market penetration. Games are in sporting goods stores and the
Barbie section of Toys R Us, keeping the concept of PC entertainment in the
heads of people everywhere. Getting into stores besides EB and Babbages is
a good thing. I know people who wouldn't be caught dead in a gaming
specialty store.

Do not fear this renaissance. Embrace it, my geeky brethren.

Non game related anecdote:

Okay, so last night on the way to see 8MM (pretty good movie) my Fiancee'
and I stopped by the local supermarket to get some beer. We go up to the
register and I put down the beer and the lady asks for my ID so I show it.
She then says "I can't sell this to you unless I see both of your ID's."

My Fiancee' isn't 21 yet, even if she was she didn't bring her ID with her,
so I said "Okay, honey, go wait in the car while I buy this." and the clerk
says "No, I saw you two come in here, and I can't sell it to you."

So, when did this happy horse shit start? What happens if a father goes to
the market with his 5 year old son? What if it is a hot day and he needs to
do some shopping, is he going to leave his kid in a sweltering car where he
can be abducted or fry? I don't think so.

I can remember dozens of times before I was 21 that I went to the market
with my mother and she purchased wine or liquor. No trouble there.

It's not like this is going to stop underage drinking. We simply went to
another supermarket and she waited in the car. Big deal.

And why can't you buy beer after 2am? This impedes the nightlife in Raleigh
as well... you go out at 11pm to party and you're supposed to be done by
2am? You're not even buzzed by then!

MUST
STOP
PLAYING
TOURNAMENT
------------------

Brandon "Greenmarine" Reinhart posted this to our messageboard
(megaboard.epicgames.com) and I think it says a lot about UT:

	"I think its really important to reiterate that UT isn't just multiplayer.
I've been spending a lot of time working out the code and story for the
single player side of the game. You don't have to have a net connection to
enjoy UT, you don't have to play online.
The single player game consists of a ladder through each of the four game
types, plus a special ladder at the end. Every map has a bit of story that
describes how the various environments fit together. Before entering a team
game you have a chance to customize your team and view the bio's for enemy
bots.
The bio's are very cool. You might run into a criminal from the Mars Prison
Colonies who is a total psycho. His description will tell you that he
enjoys close quarter fighting...likes to rip his enemies up and when you
play against him he'll move in close with the Impact Hammer. Or maybe
you'll run into one of the Necris Phayder. The Necris are a new race
(human, but with dead pale skin) who are attempting to destabilize the New
Earth Government through guerilla warfare. The Phayder are a dangerous
secret society of Necris assassins.
	The bot combat in Unreal Tournament isn't just a training mode. Its an
actual single player game. Sure, you aren't running through the normal
single player environments, but you are playing an organized series of
games. Each match has a bit of story behind it. (More than, say, a Mortal
Kombat match.)
	The skill levels in UT are very controllable. If you really suck at
deathmatch you can play on the lowest skill level and feel like a frag
master. We've also included tutorials for every gametype (including
deathmatch) to get people started. Of course, if you are a badass, you'll
be hard pressed to beat the game on the hardest skill level.
	Anyway, I thought I'd take a chance to describe exactly what that side of
UT was. Since it doesn't really get attention from the various news sites.
If you have any questions feel free to ask.
Oh, one other thing. For team games in the single player where bots are on
your side, there is an orders menu that lets you deploy the bots as you see
fit. You can tell them to guard specific locations or general tasks like
"roam and attack." 


-In other news, Kingpin looks BADASS. I'll be buying that mofo.
-I'll be at the GDC in San Jose on March 15th. I'll be doing a roundtable
on where the hell 3d shooter gameplay is going, as well as speaking on a
panel hosted by Romero and some other talented individuals on where level
design is going. Feel free to stop by and say "hi!"

Ever look at Quakefinger and go

"Who the fuck *are* these guys?" 

=)

Moving on...

Raleigh cops have nothing better to do than pull people over all fucking
day long. I swear, every night to and from work I'm either getting pulled
over or I see at least 2-3 cruisers that have pulled some poor sap over.
Guess that's the sign of a low crime rate- they're not busy dealing with
shootings or rapes. :o

I saw a picture of a woman using a cactus in an interesting manner tonight.
My life has changed forever.

UT has the coolest melee weapon I've ever seen.

If this movie looked any cooler, my eyeballs would be frozen.

[Jesus, you never realize how much you miss the 'net until you're without
it at work. Living without and then getting a T1 is like coming in from
the cold into a nice, warm bath...aaaah, Bandwidth!]

::shifting gears::

Some comparisons between the gaming biz and the porno industry:

-There are fine, half naked women at our conventions.
-We have a problem with our boxes being too large and taking up too much
shelf space.
-We both dominate the 'net...it seems you can't swing a dead cat online
without hitting a gaming or porno site.
-We make a lot of money.
-No matter how much we try we can't seem to explain to our families what,
exactly, the fuck we do all day long.
-Compared to other media types, ours cost 2x too much. Games and porn 
are usually 40+ dollars, while CD's or mainstream films are usually 
20$ or under.
-You tend to find the same types of guys in Electronics Boutique as you
find in The Toy Box.
-We're something that everyone enjoys but not everyone admits to.
-We're both struggling to tell a good storyline when all everyone
really cares about is the ACTION.

***Random Musings***

When are those great fantasy movies coming back to the big screen, 
anyways? Movies like Legend, Labyrinth, etc... would be much cooler with
today's state of the art FX.

Is it just me or are television ads for games getting better and better 
and print ads for games are still getting worse? If I see one more print
ad with some mention about "Your Stick" or "Your Gun" with the lead 
programmer's mediocre looking sister in a Gap dress I think I'm going 
to claw my eyeballs out.

We wonder why this industry gets about as much respect as the porno biz.

Oh, one final thing- the new RazorJack in UT is feckin' cool, a 
futuristic version of the gun, very nice. I wanted the team to call it 
the LaserJack, but they all felt it sounded like a Gay Disco.

Y! M! C! A!

Ahem.


---------------------------------------------------

Bust a Groove is the most charming game I've seen since Parappa the
Rapper. The characters are all great and the tunes are fantastic. Pick
it up.

Shifting gears- I swear that the SUPER HAPPY UNREAL MAP PACK will be 
released any moment- this FREE map pack includes:

*DM-cybrosis- Skaarj base deathmatch with neato jumping pads by Alan 
Willard. Well built with a nice flow.

*DM-twilight- Skycity run and gun with lots of traps by Jeremy War.

*DM-mojo- Sequel to CURSE, tight and fast DM by yours truly. 

*DM-letting- BLOOD LETTING by Myscha, one of my all time favourites.
No where to hide on this one.

*DM-shrapnel- Extremely tight industrial DM by me, my favourite of my DM
maps IMO.

Servers, please cycle these bad boys from now on and let's move on from
Deck16 and Curse. ;)
