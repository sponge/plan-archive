Once again we see an incident of violence erupt at a youth sporting event.

We must regulate youth sports. Anyone with common sense can see that they clearly cause violent behavior in kids and their parents!

:P

-----------------------

Uh, I must have been on dope the day that I wrote this question for Apache and Voodoo Extreme for their Carmack interview. I didn't finish the question. Crunch mode has a way of draining the brain. The question came across as such:

>>The climate for a successful FPS has changed dramatically since Doom first hit the market. As great as Doom was, any game that comes out now and features 40 hours of mindless shooting with key/door/switch puzzles will be ravaged in the press and sales will suffer. Half Life didn't just raise the bar for SP FPS gaming, it destroyed it, and with the possible exception of System Shock 2 and Deus Ex no game has come close to capturing the public's heart...and gaming dollar.

I meant to finish it with something like:

>>Id is infamous for keeping "lean and mean" with their development team. How do you plan on competing with the raised bar of SP focused FPS gaming with such a lean and mean team now that gamers expect so much more?

There.

Now, I'll get back to my crackpipe. :P

We need to regulate youth sports. Articles like these only enforce the argument that these events make normal, healthy parents into violent people.

Oh, sorry. I got caught up in Stupid Logic for a second.

There's a super cool contest going on in the Unreal Tournament community right now that I just had to share.

http://www.planetunreal.com/teamvortex/5cubes/

Ask yourself. Can you make a good UT map with 5 cubes? When I first heard this idea I thought "Dumb." I then started wondering what you could really build...it's really quite the entertaining map exercise.

My contribution will be posted shortly. =)

OK, OK, Thanks for all the great links on Car Mp3 players. =)

These are the best leads I found.

Here's a tip:

If your employee isn't happy, he will find a way to leave. No matter what you do to him. It is your responsibility as an employer to provide competitive wages, appropriate benefits, a healthy environment, and COOL STUFF to work on. If you need to resort to bullshit to keep them, then they're not people you'd want to keep anyways. 

Happy developers have the PASSION. 

The PASSION is what makes #1 titles.

Slavery is illegal in the USA, kids.

The BUBBLET craze is sweeping the Epic Offices!

Geesh. I got married, went on a honeymoon, and bought a house (and moved in) all within a short time period. I wouldn't suggest doing it all at once, it damn near killed my wife and I. It's nice to get back into the Work Groove after all that craziness.

I beat Deus Ex and got all 3 endings.

It is really nice to see a title that breaks through many genres at once so that people have a hard time pigeonholing the title into "RPG" or "FPS." It's all that and more. I strongly suggest checking it out, and I'm not just saying that because it uses our engine.

Greenmarine's favorite word is "Luddite." FYI.

I've decided to only put lengthy personal musings into a mailing list available at www.cliffyb.com. Plan updates will be about games and Epic from here on out.

Geoff Keighley is a top notch gaming journalist. His "behind the games" stories are great, they're well written and really tell a story. (www.gameslice.com)

I like reading stories on other developers, but often the people asking the questions can't seem to come up with anything besides:

"How did you get into the gaming industry?"
"What is your favorite game?"
"What do you think the future of the industry is?"

Or, they go the complete other way and ask stuff like:

"Billy Wilson versus Joe C in a jello wrestling match. Who wins?"

I'd like to read more articles that really attempt to get into the heads of developers, and some of Geoff's stuff does that really well.

BTW, I'm getting married June 11th. Send me presents. hehe =)

Damn, Looking Glass closed up shop. It's official...there's no justice in the world.

I remember when I saw the advertisements for Ultima Underworld on the back of CGW years ago. I had heard of Doom but I had yet to see the leaked alpha, so this was my first encounter with something that was 3d and texture mapped at the same time. It blew my mind...the sequence of shots approaching the grate thrilled me. As much as I (and everyone else) love and remember Doom I have to say that Doom's great graphical impact was lessened by UU quite a bit for me.

Recently I had the pleasure of beating System Shock 2. It was hard as hell but was so very rewarding. It's always been up there with Half-Life on my top list of compelling First Person titles.

And while I haven't had the time to finish Thief 1 and 2 (too damned busy) they're awesome too. The first time I made a noise and a guard was seeking me out a mere two feet in front of me as I stayed perfectly still with my blackjack raised was right up there with the best moments in gaming history.

Great sound work in those games too... who can forget the chilling voice of the Cyborg Midwives in SS2 or the beeping of the camera system as it spots you...or the grumbling of the guards as they complain about having to work the night shift in Thief...

I digress. I'm depressing myself, too.

-----------------------------



My feet are in the process of recovering from the insanity that is E3. I am also suffering from Post E3 depression. Am I the only one who is a bit bummed to see the show end? I mean, seeing all the great new titles, the exciting announcements, seeing old friends and showing your new product like a proud papa just adds up to way too much fun.

I got to meet ICE T and Coolio. That was cool as shit, I've been listening to Ice ever since Rhyme Pays and I love every one of his albums. He said I had nice threads. My medallion was larger than Coolio's, too. 

LOL!

(Thanks to Jason Hall for getting me in to see ICE! =))

By the end of the first day I was kicking some ass with that UT Ps2 controller from demoing so much. A lot of PC gamers came over to see it and lamented about the controller. I want to remind everyone:

1. It CAN be used to frag rather well, it just takes a lot of getting used to.
2. We'll support keyboard and mouse for Ps2 regardless.

Asia Carrera is a UT fan, some band off of MP3.com made a song about UT, our games are cross-platform, UT was all over the show, and our mod community is thriving. 

Life is Good. Must...not...get...complacent!

The Halo presentation was well worth the wait. Some great movie-like action in there, I hope it translates well to gameplay. The Red Faction destructable geometry was great, I loved watching the player control the lava flow by blowing holes in the ground and channeling it.

Metal Gear Solid 2 is going to change EVERYTHING. I was talking to someone who was discussing making a film based on the MGS franchise and I had the realization that there's now way anyone could make a film that would compete with the action excitement that that game is going to deliver. This is going to be a landmark title in the history of gaming, and I am truly humbled by the talent over there!

What title am I REALLY looking forward to seeing at e3 this year?

Big, swinging, brass balls on those guys over at Rare.

I was in STITCHES at the trailer.

There was a Daily Radar link up earlier but it's down now, it might come up later.

Enjoy. =)

I've updated my website with some quick tips for Unreal Tournament level designers everywhere.

Hopefully you'll find them useful. There's a big, scatterbrained mix of newbie tips and advanced tips.

I enjoy doing interviews. Usually the interviewer is someone mature, intelligent, and well-read.

Jeff K. is not one of those people! He's a little kid who I happened to run into one day online who is just trying to get hits for his website.

Try to be nice to someone and they take advantage of you! Jeez.

WARNING!

GEEK NOSTALGIA ALERT!

Like most others my age, I was not only raised on Atari, Sega and Nintendo I was raised on Giant Robots!

My brother visited my moms house recently and dug out our Transformer collection and FedExd me a pile of them. He used to collect the Decepticons, Id collect the Autobots. They provided us with countless hours of enjoyment. I remember we were initially into the Go-Bots; we had acquired a couple of them and were enjoying them until we saw the commercials for the Transformers at which point we realized how sucky the Go-Bots were and abandoned them.

We went over to the five and dime in Andover, Mass. and I got Bluestreak while he got Thundercracker. At that point a line in the sand was drawn, my brother would forever be a Decepticon and I would always be an Autobot. Its amazing how far you can stretch paper route cash on toys when youre determined enough. Wed ask for TFs for our birthdays, Christmas, and any other occasion we could think of.  I remember my mother was uncomfortable with buying Megatron for my brother because he was a gun a Walther p38, nonetheless. I think about that toy now and if you walked around in public with it youd get your ass shot or arrested!

We swung by Child World one day when we were driving into Boston and I picked up Optimus Prime. I always loved Prime, he was the coolest toy and his character kicked total ass on the cartoon series.

Thats why the film was so upsetting! When Optimus Prime died I was totally bummed out they then had to go replace him with that lamer Rodimus Prime and the TV series went to shit. Galvatron just owned everyone in the film and they then had to make him land in that pile of space goo, turning him into a blathering idiot. My brother and I still argue about who won that battle, Megatron or Prime. If Hot Rod hadnt got in the way dammit! Gotta admit, though, the relationship between Daniel and Hot Rod was great; what kid hadnt dreamt of having a giant ass kicking robot for a friend? I think thats part of why I loved Iron Giant so much, BTW.

I swear, the TF film still holds up today, the animation was spectacular. I remember my jaw dropping when I was in the theater and I heard Spike say Oh SHIT! That was the pinnacle of Geek Zen, hearing that kind of language in the movie youd been waiting for.

Ah, well, I digress

Precursor to my Transformer obsession was Force Five.

http://www.concentric.net/~marsala9/force5.html

You can find some great stuff on this site about the series. I recently found a 7 tall, Die Cast Metal Grandizer on Ebay and Im trying to collect all 3 of the Starvengers. I picked up several of the videos of the series on Amazon, just do a search and youll find them. GRANDIZER GO! hehe

We used to love watching that after school, as well as Starblazers. Starblazers was a another series that 0wned.

Okay, Im going to go back to my geek cave now. =)
