Ever look at Quakefinger and go

"Who the fuck *are* these guys?" 

=)

Moving on...

Raleigh cops have nothing better to do than pull people over all fucking
day long. I swear, every night to and from work I'm either getting pulled
over or I see at least 2-3 cruisers that have pulled some poor sap over.
Guess that's the sign of a low crime rate- they're not busy dealing with
shootings or rapes. :o

I saw a picture of a woman using a cactus in an interesting manner tonight.
My life has changed forever.

UT has the coolest melee weapon I've ever seen.

If this movie looked any cooler, my eyeballs would be frozen.

[Jesus, you never realize how much you miss the 'net until you're without
it at work. Living without and then getting a T1 is like coming in from
the cold into a nice, warm bath...aaaah, Bandwidth!]

::shifting gears::

Some comparisons between the gaming biz and the porno industry:

-There are fine, half naked women at our conventions.
-We have a problem with our boxes being too large and taking up too much
shelf space.
-We both dominate the 'net...it seems you can't swing a dead cat online
without hitting a gaming or porno site.
-We make a lot of money.
-No matter how much we try we can't seem to explain to our families what,
exactly, the fuck we do all day long.
-Compared to other media types, ours cost 2x too much. Games and porn 
are usually 40+ dollars, while CD's or mainstream films are usually 
20$ or under.
-You tend to find the same types of guys in Electronics Boutique as you
find in The Toy Box.
-We're something that everyone enjoys but not everyone admits to.
-We're both struggling to tell a good storyline when all everyone
really cares about is the ACTION.

***Random Musings***

When are those great fantasy movies coming back to the big screen, 
anyways? Movies like Legend, Labyrinth, etc... would be much cooler with
today's state of the art FX.

Is it just me or are television ads for games getting better and better 
and print ads for games are still getting worse? If I see one more print
ad with some mention about "Your Stick" or "Your Gun" with the lead 
programmer's mediocre looking sister in a Gap dress I think I'm going 
to claw my eyeballs out.

We wonder why this industry gets about as much respect as the porno biz.

Oh, one final thing- the new RazorJack in UT is feckin' cool, a 
futuristic version of the gun, very nice. I wanted the team to call it 
the LaserJack, but they all felt it sounded like a Gay Disco.

Y! M! C! A!

Ahem.

Bust a Groove is the most charming game I've seen since Parappa the
Rapper. The characters are all great and the tunes are fantastic. Pick
it up.

Shifting gears- I swear that the SUPER HAPPY UNREAL MAP PACK will be 
released any moment- this FREE map pack includes:

*DM-cybrosis- Skaarj base deathmatch with neato jumping pads by Alan 
Willard. Well built with a nice flow.

*DM-twilight- Skycity run and gun with lots of traps by Jeremy War.

*DM-mojo- Sequel to CURSE, tight and fast DM by yours truly. 

*DM-letting- BLOOD LETTING by Myscha, one of my all time favourites.
No where to hide on this one.

*DM-shrapnel- Extremely tight industrial DM by me, my favourite of my DM
maps IMO.

Servers, please cycle these bad boys from now on and let's move on from
Deck16 and Curse. ;)
