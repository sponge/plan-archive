Upon reading Jack Kroll's editorial, one might infer that he believes the only medium that can convey emotion to the user is film.

Emotion is in a person's head and heart, not on the screen.

When film first came along, proponents of live theatre were skeptical of its ability to convey emotion. After all, the audience was not watching live people acting, they were watching pre-recorded images that were being played back on a flat screen. How could this medium possibly ever cause a viewer to cry because of the death of a character, or become excited by conflict?

How then, is it possible, to be brought to tears by a novel? To feel excited by a song? To be titillated by a sensual painting? A novel lacks the smile of an actress. Most great paintings lack photorealism yet are still able to evoke emotion from the viewer.

I have been playing electronic entertainment all my life. I was born and raised on it. I have shed tears at stories of love, I have thrilled to battles won by brave warriors, and I have had crushes on digital princesses.

Is it pretentious for a designer to consider himself an artist? No. In fact, his medium is the most innovative and exciting new frontier for artists everywhere. If a character dies in a film it can tug at the emotions of the audience. However, in a game, if a character dies who has saved the gamer's life then the gamer feels responsible. This creates an emotional bond that no other form of media can. If a sexy femme fatale crosses her legs in a digital interrogation then the player has the choice of whether or not he's going to risk being thrown off the case for pursuing her. In film, the viewer just sits there and watches. The most emotional entertainment experiences for myself, and a generation, have occurred during titles such as "Lunar," "Final Fantasy," and "System Shock"

An active form of entertainment can create far more emotion in the user than a passive form. In gaming, the story is driven forward and defined by the user's actions. He commits himself emotionally more, because he's investing his own time and ability into it.

Games are no longer child's play, they are the freshest and most exciting medium of artistry for the new Millenium.

I'm speaking at the Computer Game Developer's conference this year.

Last year I did a round table on 3d shooter design that went pretty well, so I figured this year I'd take a stab at a lecture.

Those interested in learning my opinions on where the role of the designer, as well as many common and advanced design techniques are welcome to attend and hear me run my lil' mouth for an hour or so. ;)

The session is 4404 and is listed at

http://www.gdconf.com

I'm speaking at the same time as Dave Perry of Shiny Entertainment. I hear he's a good speaker. I'm going to have to sabotage his talk by bribing more people to come to my lecture! Muhuhaha!

After the conference I'll be posting my written materials on my website at www.cliffyb.com. It will be the debut of something useful on my personal homepage.

I'd like to welcome abord our two new artists, Steve Garofalo and John Mueller. 

I expect great things from them.

INFILTRATION ROCKS!

http://www.planetunreal.com/infiltration/

We need more servers running this Mod. This is going to be some ass-kicking stuff if these guys manage to implement even 1/4th of the features they have planned. It is amazing how much a mod like this can change the gameplay of any of UT's gametypes. I'm especially impressed with how well Assault plays with Infiltration.

In other news, I'd be a liar if I said the snow here hasn't slowed down the forthcoming free-release Epic Bonus Pack.

For those of you who are patiently waiting for this I can tell you that all the content is ready to go and we're testing it.

Those of you in the San Fran Bay Area on the 21st can go see some Cat Scans on display in an exhibit called "Emotionally Annoyed." Which I suppose that makes me, now, by association. Grrrrrr.

>>Jeeez, textures are becoming more popular than Penis pumps at homosexual blanket parties.  

Why does Billy Wilson know these things?

DARKMATCH LIVES!

Eavy, a UT mod author, has resurrected one of my favorite gametypes for Unreal1. Darkmatch was largely thrown into Unreal1 as an afterthought, something experimental, but this UT mod is now the real deal. 

It's like Hide and Go Seek in the Dark... with Guns!

If you're running a UT competition I'd strongly suggest using these settings:

Official Epic Games Tourney Settings

One on One
----------
Weapons Stay- OFF
Game Speed- DEFAULT
NO TRANSLOCATOR
NO BOTS (duh)
Game Setting- HARDCORE
Mutators- NO REDEEMER, NO POWERUPS
Frag Limit- 20
Time Limit- 10

Suggested 1 on 1 Maps (my personal opinion)
-------------------------------------------
Liandri
Codex
Grinder
Turbine
Malevolence (to be released in upcoming free Bonus Pack)

Oh, and if you haven't downloaded the free CTF maps that Digital Extremes created then you're seriously missing out.

www.digitalextremes.com

These are 2 top notch maps created by 2 of UT's best level designers and they're above and beyond commercial quality.

I'd love to see more servers running these maps online!!!

Shit I'd love to see more servers! Yeah!

[PIMP HAT OFF]
--------------------
I enjoy perusing the forums where UT gamers get to 
voice their opinions. I consider it part of my job as well.

However, I feel the need to clarify some confusion that 
I've noticed in regards to the maps that we chose to ship 
with in UT.

Give me a chance to address some of these concerns, and 
use my plan file for Good.

1. "Just because you make a spaceship or a boat doesn't 
mean it plays well!"

You seem more Old School. I'd suggest playing the 
following maps then:

DM-Zeto
DM-Deck16][
DM-Grinder
DM-Codex
DM-Curse][
DM-Turbine
DM-Liandri
DM-Pressure
DM-Tempest

These are maps that were made just for the gameplay, the 
architecture is dictated by the gameplay. These maps are 
more traditional, mazey DM.

2. "These maps are bland! I don't want a cramped mazey 
bland area; been there done that! Show me something new!"

I'd suggest playing the following maps then:

DM-Gothic
DM-Hyperblast
DM-KGalleon
DM-Peak
DM-Barricade
DM-Phobos
DM-Morpheus
DM-Conveyor

The Unreal Engine handles interior and exterior 
spaces extremely well and maps like Peak and 
Hyperblast really take advantage of this. These 
maps are original, you get to frag in really 
exquisite environments. Sure, they may not be 
the ones you play in a tourney, but they sure 
have that "wow" factor.

3. "These CTF maps aren't symmetrical! These 
CTF maps are too tight!"

The issue of symmetry is something we really 
beat ourselves up over when making the UT maps. 
At the end of the day we went with a mixed 
selection; some maps were symmetrical while 
others weren't. The asymmetrical maps required 
a ton of testing and we feel that they're pretty 
well balanced. For instance, in CTF-Command the 
blue base has a slow lift and long ramp to get 
to the flag, but there's a back entrance you can 
access fairly easily if you're good with the 
translocator. In CTF-November there's a long 
winding staircase to the blue base, but once you 
get the flag you can just drop right out of it. 
In the red base there's a long pipe leading to 
the flag that you have to run through to get in 
and out of the base.

If you'd prefer more open CTF maps then I'd suggest:

CTF-Face and CTF-LavaGiant

These maps also play extremely well in low-gravity 
mode. Remember, dodging is very useful in low-grav. 
You can zip around maps easily using it.

Oh, also, server admins: Please don't run TURBO 
assault servers. It kind of kills the point of the 
game where you can destroy the assault target in 8 
seconds flat. :P

One of the reasons we wound up with over 50 maps in 
UT (besides having some really hard working level 
designers) is because we wanted to make sure we 
appealed to the broadest audience possible. Some 
people like the gimmicky maps, others like the more 
traditional DM maps, others prefer to fight in realistic 
locations. It's all there! If you don't like playing 
one kind of map then give the game a minute as the server 
will cycle to one you probably dig.

Hard to please all of the people some of the time or some 
of the people all of the time.

p.s. Dig this:

------------------------------------------

Something is really distressing me when I browse the server
list in Ubrowser in UT.

Many server admins think that just because a map shipped 
with the game that it is ok for dozens of players to play
at once.

Deathmatch maps like "Fractal," "Oblivion," and "Stalwart" are TINY and
are meant for one on one, no more. When you run a server with
a 32 player limit and add these maps to your cycle list you're
just ruining the play experience for those who are trying to 
find a good local server.

CTF maps like "Niven" are meant for 2 on 2 or 3 on 3 CTF, 
nothing more. They're not even in the default map list, this
is for a REASON!

So, please, don't cycle these maps unless you're keeping your
max players very low.

Thanks

A lot of people have asked me where I got my p1mp necklace.

Clay from QVT made it for me, custom job!

We're considering having Clay make more depending on demand.

Updated UT demo is out.

http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?file=29108

PATCH from last version:
http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?file=29107

In addition to oodles of misc. improvements, 
(new pulse skin, menu changes, optimizations, etc...)
Steve has also increased the player's drawscale 
slightly as well as their ambient brightness.

Notice how much easier players are to see now.
