My name is Brian Shubat and this is my debut on my finger account. I'm a 3-d Animator using Softimage 3-D as my software package of choice. Let me start by saying we here at Raven don't make the technology you see in our games, we make the technology you see in our games better. My current assignment is animating the player character in Heretic 2 and we've come up with quite a few new innovations for poly models in the Quake 2 engine. I won't go into detail about them now but I will say that you should expect a lot of animations and flexible use of them all. There are good things in store for this game so it should be quite an experience.
