Hey howdy all. This is gonna
be short because I have two skins to paint in like 48 hours and at the same
time I am moving across town. And did I mention my wife gave birth recently?
Our first little beta tester  Corbin Bennett Walden. Hes a little copper top
and hes totally cool. But exhausting.

 

I ditched the old plan file
for now. Thought Id start fresh. It was all mostly babble anyway.

 

More as soon as I have
enough time and enough sleep to forge a complete sentence.

 

Oh. The skin I am doing is
of the main player character. I have a feeling Ill be redoing the model  Im
just not happy with how he looks. But we gotta get something in the game for
now so there ya go.
