Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force has an official website. It is loaded 
with content ranging from screenshots, concept art, in game models, 
and all kinds of game information. We, the development team have been 
really busy developing the game, now we want everyone to see a little 
more of what this game is about. We will be updating the site constatly 
so come to it often, see what we're up to and join in on the message 
board. Thanks for your interest in Elite Force and we promise to have 
a fun informative web site monitored by the development team. We will 
continue creating a kick ass action game and now you know where to go 
for the latest information. 

I will be writing a plan file on a regular basis from now on. at least
once a month.

I am flying to the Activision office in LA next week for one of the 
games major milestones. I am showing a playable version of the game
showing off the AI for the NPC Hazard team members that go on missions
with the player. It's an awesome looking demo of a more finalized
Borg cube and Borg drones complete with laser eye beams. I also go
to Paramount studios to show them the demo and discuss the game. Maybe 
this time I can get a set tour. My previous visits, I've been to busy 
in meetings and getting reference from the ST reference library.

Well, It's been about 3 weeks since I've been back from my business trip 
to Activision and Paramount in sunny LA. I was there for one day for 
meetings and to show off our new game demo. At Activision, I presented 
the game to the President of the company, Ron Doornink, Exec VP of world 
wide studio's, Mitch Lasky, VP of sales, Ron Scott and many other top dogs 
at Activision. It's not as bad as it sounds, everyone there is really cool
and they're good guys who are down to earth, not your stuffy corporate
types. Raven had two goals we needed to prove, make convincing NPC AI and 
make the scipted events interactive. I am pleased to say that they were 
very impressed. Raven achieved in the game what we said we would, which 
I beleive went beyond their expectations.

The demo went something like this: Beam into a Borg Cube with 4 NPC away
team members. There are Borg in the room you are in but they ignore you.
if you shoot them, then they will attack you or course. As you walk through
the Cube your teammate follow right along with you and don't get in your
way. They even talk amongst themselves. At one point a Borg comes out of an 
Alcove in front of you start walking toward you and your tema. One of your
teammates say's "should I shoot the Borg sir?" the player has the option now
to respone with a yes or no command (Y and N keys) and control the action
of the NPC teammate. if you press Y (yes) then he shoots the Borg. But by 
doing that the Borg you left alone at the begining will come and attack you.
If you press N (no) then he lowers his weapon and the Borg walks right by; 
unless you attacked the Borg in the begining. If so the the Borg will walk
up to that teammate and try to assimilate him. this is an example of our 
interactive scripts. After that encounter you continue walking until you come 
to a force field blocking your way. This is where you see your Hazard team
members work intelligently. The technician walks to a Borg computer console
and start tries to bring down the force field, but says "I can't access the
force field from here." She then takes out a tricorder and examines a 
generator thingy on the wall and says "Chang, blow up this generator." Chang,
the demolitionist walks over to it and plants an explosive device on it and
says "Take cover." The team then finds cover behind pillars and half walls. 
The explosion goes off and the force field is deactivated. All of this 
happens in game for the player to see and is not a cinematic! You encounter
more Borg in the next room and they attack you and your teammates intelligently
attack back. the battles are really cool too because your team talks amongst
themselves and say stuff like "watch your back" "stay focused" and "assimilate
this!" the overall feeling is that the team are real people fighting along with
you which adds to the excitment of the battle. You as the player have to watch
your teammates backs too because they could die. It seems like every time I 
play the demo something different happens. it's never the same twice, and it's
that unpredictibilty that is going to make playing this game so fun!!

Okay, that's enough for now. Next time I'll talk about what happened at Paramount.
