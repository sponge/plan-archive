In my last .plan I didn't get around to finishing my story about my trip
to LA, when I showed the Elite Force demo to Activision and Paramount. 
Read last .plan to get caught up. 

So I got done demoing at Activision and headed to Paramount for lunch. I 
had an early breakfast at the hotel that morning and as I was leaving the
hotel to get a cab, OJ Simpson was walking in and we exchanged Good
Mornings. I found out that OJ lives at that Hotel, so I guess it wasn't 
really a chance meeting. Anyway, I was hungary...got to Paramount had lunch 
with the licensing people, Harry and Juliet (the are the ones who OKAY 
everything we do) and afterwards kicked into high gear for the rest of the day.

I showed the demo to Harry and Juliet and they loved it saying it was one
of the best looking Star Trek games they have seen so far. They even went
to the extent of calling their boss into the office so I could give her the 
demo and presentation. Star Trek head honcho Rick Berman's right hand man
has seen the game and saw the demo after I left and he thought it was 
awesome and he really likes the idea of the Hazard Team and the whole
concept behind it. I hope to get more reactions from the shows creators
later on when the game is more complete.

After demoing, Harry finally took me on a set tour of Voyager. I've been
to Paramount 3 other times but was always too busy to get a tour, so it was
about time. The cast and crew were on lunch so I got to walk in and around
the whole set. I sat in the captains chair and stood on the transporter pad.
The actors trailer are parked right out front of the stage building but didn't
see any of them. I did get to meet Mr. Simms the guy who makes all the props
for the show.

I then went upstairs, above the stage to the art department offices, to meet
with Rick Sternbach Voyagers technical illustrator. We talked shop for a while
and he gave me a lot of ideas of how to layout the decks for the game. The 
decks on the ship are pretty big and we definately can't recreate them exactly 
for the game but we will have areas of the decks and at least make the player 
feel like they are traveling through a good portion of the ship. Rick and the
other artist Tim Earl are creating a Hazard Team/Elite Force emblem for the
game. I didn't get to see anything they were working on because we were talking
shop for so long, but the art department is filled with all kinds of great 
Star Trek art memorabilia. As an artist and Fan, it was really awesome to see.

My next meeting was with the Casting Director Ron Surma. Ron casts all the
actors for the Star Trek shows. He will be doing our casting for all the 
extra actors we need for the game. He is a good guy and has a good ear for
voices. We need actors for all 7 of the Hazard Team characters, and many 
other supporting characters. We will also be using an acting group called 
the Loop Group and they do all the Borg voices, Klingon group voices and 
background voices for the Trek shows, so that will help make the game more 
authentic.

After those meetings, Harry and I went back to his office to talk more about
the game. We are all striving the make the best game possible and hopefully
deliver the best Star Trek Game thus far. We have the difficult job of trying 
to make a game that is fun for Gamers and Trek fans and we are trying to balance
all the features so we can meet everyones expectations. 

After Finishing the business at Paramount it was back to Activision for more 
meetings. Needless to say by the end of the day I was pretty tired, and my flight 
was leaving at 11:30 that night. That's all right it was a super successful
trip and I got a lot done. It's all part of the process to making sure the 
game is going to be great.

Well, It's been about 3 weeks since I've been back from my business trip 
to Activision and Paramount in sunny LA. I was there for one day for 
meetings and to show off our new game demo. At Activision, I presented 
the game to the President of the company, Ron Doornink, Exec VP of world 
wide studio's, Mitch Lasky, VP of sales, Ron Scott and many other top dogs 
at Activision. It's not as bad as it sounds, everyone there is really cool
and they're good guys who are down to earth, not your stuffy corporate
types. Raven had two goals we needed to prove, make convincing NPC AI and 
make the scipted events interactive. I am pleased to say that they were 
very impressed. Raven achieved in the game what we said we would, which 
I beleive went beyond their expectations.

The demo went something like this: Beam into a Borg Cube with 4 NPC away
team members. There are Borg in the room you are in but they ignore you.
if you shoot them, then they will attack you or course. As you walk through
the Cube your teammate follow right along with you and don't get in your
way. They even talk amongst themselves. At one point a Borg comes out of an 
Alcove in front of you start walking toward you and your tema. One of your
teammates say's "should I shoot the Borg sir?" the player has the option now
to respone with a yes or no command (Y and N keys) and control the action
of the NPC teammate. if you press Y (yes) then he shoots the Borg. But by 
doing that the Borg you left alone at the begining will come and attack you.
If you press N (no) then he lowers his weapon and the Borg walks right by; 
unless you attacked the Borg in the begining. If so the the Borg will walk
up to that teammate and try to assimilate him. this is an example of our 
interactive scripts. After that encounter you continue walking until you come 
to a force field blocking your way. This is where you see your Hazard team
members work intelligently. The technician walks to a Borg computer console
and start tries to bring down the force field, but says "I can't access the
force field from here." She then takes out a tricorder and examines a 
generator thingy on the wall and says "Chang, blow up this generator." Chang,
the demolitionist walks over to it and plants an explosive device on it and
says "Take cover." The team then finds cover behind pillars and half walls. 
The explosion goes off and the force field is deactivated. All of this 
happens in game for the player to see and is not a cinematic! You encounter
more Borg in the next room and they attack you and your teammates intelligently
attack back. the battles are really cool too because your team talks amongst
themselves and say stuff like "watch your back" "stay focused" and "assimilate
this!" the overall feeling is that the team are real people fighting along with
you which adds to the excitment of the battle. You as the player have to watch
your teammates backs too because they could die. It seems like every time I 
play the demo something different happens. it's never the same twice, and it's
that unpredictibilty that is going to make playing this game so fun!!

Okay, that's enough for now. Next time I'll talk about what happened at Paramount.

so come to it often, see what we're up to and join in on the message 
board. Thanks for your interest in Elite Force and we promise to have 
a fun informative web site monitored by the development team. We will 
continue creating a kick ass action game and now you know where to go 
for the latest information. 

I will be writing a plan file on a regular basis from now on. at least
once a month.

I am flying to the Activision office in LA next week for one of the 
games major milestones. I am showing a playable version of the game
showing off the AI for the NPC Hazard team members that go on missions
with the player. It's an awesome looking demo of a more finalized
Borg cube and Borg drones complete with laser eye beams. I also go
to Paramount studios to show them the demo and discuss the game. Maybe 
this time I can get a set tour. My previous visits, I've been to busy 
in meetings and getting reference from the ST reference library.
