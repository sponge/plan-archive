Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force has an official website. It is loaded 
with content ranging from screenshots, concept art, in game models, 
and all kinds of game information. We, the development team have been 
really busy developing the game, now we want everyone to see a little 
more of what this game is about. We will be updating the site constatly 
so come to it often, see what we're up to and join in on the message 
board. Thanks for your interest in Elite Force and we promise to have 
a fun informative web site monitored by the development team. We will 
continue creating a kick ass action game and now you know where to go 
for the latest information. 

I will be writing a plan file on a regular basis from now on. at least
once a month.

I am flying to the Activision office in LA next week for one of the 
games major milestones. I am showing a playable version of the game
showing off the AI for the NPC Hazard team members that go on missions
with the player. It's an awesome looking demo of a more finalized
Borg cube and Borg drones complete with laser eye beams. I also go
to Paramount studios to show them the demo and discuss the game. Maybe 
this time I can get a set tour. My previous visits, I've been to busy 
in meetings and getting reference from the ST reference library.

later
