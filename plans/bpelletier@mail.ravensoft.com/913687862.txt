Hmmm, another 20 hour work day yesterday. That has pretty much been the
norm for some of us here lately. Last week we did major fixes and 
cleaned up the game a lot. We sent in what we were hoping would be the 
final code build of the game last thursday. QA testing over the weekend
found some outstanding issues with the game and it was decided that we
are too close to greatness, to let these things slide. So back to work 
we went. We were given about 5-10 outstanding issues, only 2 of them 
being crash bugs, and 20 lower prioriety bugs. I have to say I am more
than proud of the Heretic II team; they worked the weekend (again) and
fixed every single bug we got. We just finished up last night at 5 am.
It's now at Activisions QA department to be tested. We should get word
sometime later today on the status of the latest build. If all goes 
well, it should be the last one and then can go to manufacturing.

We will miss our initial in stores date but we were so close we just
wanted to make the game as solid as we possibly could. I can tell from
testing the game for past 20 hours, it is pretty damn solid; no crashes,
major errors or game stopping bugs. Sure there were a few little 
anomalies happening but nothing major (they should be fixed now). And 
that's a testement to our hard work cause there is a lot...and I mean 
a lot of stuff going on in this game, talk about sensory overload.
Our game has speacial effects that are going to blow you away!! While 
playing some of the later levels, I was running around with 3 defensive
spells going around my character while shooting my powered up Storm Bow
and being shot at by some spell casting bad guys...it put 4th of july
fireworks to shame. All that going on and I still couldn't get the
game to break or crash. Our programmers rock!!!

The few extra days wait will be well worth it. And still in plenty of 
time for your X-mas list.  I just can't wait to sleep. Not to mention
I haven't seen my wife for more that 20 hours in the past 3 1/2 weeks.
I miss her dearly and can't wait to spend time with her. She has been
great during all of this. She made cookies for all us guys staying 
late and some popyseed bread and brownies. Thanks for all the support 
Lisa, Me and all the guys appreciate it so much. I love you...your the 
best. Can you say Cancun vacation...

Back to testing.......
Brian

We are frantically trying to finish Heretic II. There are just a couple
outstanding bugs that are holding us up. We also spent the last 2 weeks
Play-testing and balancing the game and doing any last minute tweaks to
make the game more fun. Some were minor changes but really added to the 
gameplay and funfactor.  This team is great and they have been coming up 
with excellent ideas that I think will really make this game memorable.
I am really proud of the team and how everyone has contributed ideas 
and done their share of workload to getting this game done. We are all 
proud of this game because it was a team effort and everyone on this 
project can say that a piece of them is in this game.  And because of that
they want this game to be the best. As I play the game I can say it will
be the best.

You wouldn't believe the cool stuff going on in this game. The first levels
are in an elven village and the people are all insane with bloodlust from
a mysterious plague. But they're not just mindless Zombies, they talk to you 
and form  groups and gang up on you; they really react to what you do; I walked
into a room with a few plague elves and one points at me and says "there he
is, get him" then another guy in the room says "I want to eat his flesh" while 
the third guy says "I want his liver"! like battling 3 guys isn't hard enough, 
they have to taunt me... Then as I start throwing spells at them they get 
hurt, drop their weapons and run away saying "don't hurt me." and "have mercy" 
I almost don't want to do them in...almost.

In another part of the game I'm in a level fight Harpies, which are the flying
creatures kind of like a vultures. They swoop down and do a ramming attack that
knocks me on my back, I bounce back up and search the skies for him. I hear 
his attacking screech and when I turn to cast my spell at him it's too late;
he rams into me but this time with his claws and he rips my head right off. 
My headless body slumps to the ground as I watch the beastie fly away with
my head in his talons...literally. Now I usually don't like dying but this 
time for some reason I cheered. I just don't get sick of playing this game,
something new and different happens all the time.

I do the game no justice by telling you all the cool things that happen to me
while I play this game. You might not even believe some of this stuff...
You'll just have to play it for yourself to see.

Only a few more weeks. Sit tight, it's well worth it.

Hi all, It's been a while since I've written a .plan, but that's only 
because I've been sooo busy making and cooridinating the game that most 
of you have been playing the demo of. I'm the Project Leader and it's my 
job to be in charge of every single aspect of Heretic II.  The Heretic II
Team is the best, most dedicated team I have ever worked with. Talk about
talent. I'm writing now to talk about the demo and the game.  I figured I
wouldn't speek up again until the public has seen and played Heretic II.

The Demo consists of 2 levels of the game. The first level, and 11th level
of the game, plus 2 deathmatch levels and a training level to get you 
accustumed to the player controls. Most of your configs will work for 
movement but there are 2 more buttons you need. An "action", and a "creep" 
key. The final version of the game will have double tap configures and 
hotkey confugures; so you can put together all kind of speacial moves 
easily. I have a double tap for back flip and when I am being chased there
is nothing more rewarding than quickly back-flipping over my chaser and now
I can attack them from behind. That is just 1 example of many cool moves 
you can do. There is definately more combat statagey going on in Heretic II.

The Demo is only a little sampling of what Heretic II has to offer. If you 
like it now or don't like it; keep in mind there is plenty more coming.
You still haven't seen the other 3 weapons and their powerups or the 3 other
defensive spells. That's "9" new spells yet to be seen! Deathmatch will be 
AWESOME!!! The single player game will be just as fun. There are 8 different 
area looks with all their own texture sets and fantastic creatures.  The
cinematic scene that you saw in the demo was just the first scene that sets
up the unfolding story. There are over 10 more cinematic scenes like that 
throughout the game.

We still have a long way to go in such a short time. We are supposed to have
the game finalized by Nov 1st so you can get the game by mid November. That 
leaves us only 9 days to finish this whole game. We will be pouring our heart
and soul into finishing this game for you on time. We have been working non-stop
and will continue to do so up to completion. So if you don't here much
from the Raven team in the next week or so, you'll know why. We are making 
for you the best action game ever!!!

Thank you,
Brian Pelletier

Great...we lost to Romero and his crew at Age of Empires. I just want to
make a statement now, that the rest of the Raven staff, myself included,
should not be compared to those losers who shamelessly represented us.
I can expect to see more games of AOE being played at the office to come 
up with better game strategies. Like they didn’t play enough already!

Heretic 2:
We are getting great feedback from everyone out there, so keep it coming, 
we read it all. Another tidbit, is that I’ve been working with the Fantasy artist Brom who is designing most of our characters and monsters for
the game. You can see his work at www.cale.com/brom/ or pick up his
book Darkwerks at your local book store. A great showcase of his work.
And you can expect to see some of the coolest creatures you’ve ever seen
in a game. 
When we started designing this game way back when. We always made 
reference to Brom style artwork for the feel of the game. So we decided,
hell, why not go to the source. We’ve been friends with Brom since he 
did the Heretic cover back in ’94. We’ve always kept in touch, So Steve
Raffel twisted Brom’s arm into working with us on Heretic 2. Brom worked 
with us during the initial design phase and we came up with a lot of cool ideas.
(He had the idea of the plague!) He and I then went to work designing most
of the races and creatures of the game. The rest of our Awesome art staff 
Did tons of other conceptual drawings. But we wanted Brom’s vision for
the races of the Heretic world.
I just talked with Brom yesterday and he is really stoked about all the excitement
with Heretic 2. We will start posting some conceptual artwork in the near future.
I will keep you updated on that. 

Time to look at the progress of the levels. We’ve got a bunch of guys doing 
levels and they are all looking very cool. The level’s not the guys!

I’ll continue at another time and let you get back to playing games. Raven games!!!

I will continue from last time with:

What we're thinking 2:

For more insight to the camera system and story line see Dan Freed's plan.

Targeting system:
We will be handling this a few ways so people will have a choice of
how they want to play. 
First off, there is no auto targeting like Tomb raider. (there was a 
great discussion of this on our messageboard) One targeting method 
will be just like the original Heretic, Doom and Hexen 2, where there 
will be a cone of influence. Projected out in front of the player will be 
this range. If a monster is in this range the shot will go toward him. 
We need to do this because our camera can be at many different angles and 
we want our character to shot in front of him not where the camera's looking. 
Again, it works just like the Doom system, so there "is" skill involved.
Second: You shot where the camera is looking. just like Quake 2 and Hexen 2.
As Dan mentioned in his plan we have a free look camera and there will be a
crosshair option to help aim.
The third system we are still playing around with. All of these will involve a
lot of playtesting to make sure they work really awesome.

Deathmatch:
There are ideas of doing different models for choosing deathmatch characters.
But right now this option looks to be very difficult. Our character will
have close to a thousand frames of animation, so to translate all these to a whole new
character will be tough.
Because it looks like there will be only one model we will have different skins to 
choose from. Not just different colors.

Why only third person:
Cause I said so!!! Heh, I’m just kidding. Right now the biggest reason is because of 
our schedule. We want the game out for a x-mas release and we are only in the 
second month of our production. We have only 2 levels complete and we don’t even
have our new character model in the game yet. The model you saw on the screen 
shot was the old version.
Another reason is that first and 3rd person games are very different from one another.
So it will be like making 2 games. Jedi is really a first person game with a 3rd person
option. That’s why 3rd person in jedi looks goofy, and is not as fluid as other 3rd 
person games.

Hope that answers some of the questions floating around out there.
I will add more to this topic as we progress with the game.

Later


**************************************************************
3/30/98

I have been reading a lot of the talk on our message board, and 
I am glad to see such great ideas and responses. I've also gotten
some e-mails on the topic. It seems people are interested to find 
out what we're thinking.

Well here it goes...

Why the name: 
	The story of Heretic 2 directly follows the events in Heretic.
The reason Hexen wasn't named Heretic 2 was because the story 
didn't directly follow Heretic. Heretic, Hexen and Hexen 2 followed
the story of the 3 Serpent Riders. Hexen took place 1000 years(or so)
after Heretic and on an all together different world. 
	
Heretic 2 now goes back to tell the tale of what happened to our 
hero after he defeated D'Sparil. And bring you back to reintorduce 
you to the world of Heretic. Heretic 2 seemed to be the name that 
fit the best. 

How the game came to be:
	Steve Raffel (one of Raven's founders) Came up with the idea
to do Heretic 2 a couple years ago. And to do it from a 3rd PP.
This was before Tomb Raider came out. Steve and I played around with 
the idea of bringing you back to the Heretic world and really making
it a believable world that our character has his quest in. We wanted 
to do it 3PP because that would make it a challange for us. We are
creative people here at Raven and because of that we like to challange
ourselves creatively. THis job would bet real boring if every game we
made was a FPS. So what we wanted to do was try something new and 
give the gamer a new playing experience. So we got the OK to do the
game and I was given the lead to take to completion. 

To be honest, I thought most gamers would like the change of an action
game from a 3PP. We all know the market is flooded with FPS, Half life,
Unreal, Diakatana, Hexen 2, Quake 2, and others to be announced. 
So why not try action from 3PP. My whole goal is to keep the integrity
of an action game. Which we all love. But son-of-bitch, I'm getting 
sick of seeing it in only one form! I love FPS games and will continue
to make them with Raven, but I envision a fast paced high action game
where I can see my character shooting his weapon and see him getting 
hit. Watching him interact with the world and enjoying the action 
taking place besides just being the action.

That's it for now. 

I will continue with "What we're thinking" on my next plan where I 
talk about:
	The targeting system
	Why "only" 3rd person
	Deathmatch!

Later.

Hey All,

As you all heard by now Raven is making Heretic II. My name is
Brian Pelletier and I am the Project leader of this game so it 
is under my control and direction. With the Awesome team we have 
and all the the great ideas they have, we promise you a kick ass 
game. I will get into that shortly.

Before I get into Heretic II, it will help you to know who I am.
I am an Artist and I have been with Raven for over 5 years now.
I am the most senior employee here. At one point in Raven's history 
it was just Brian Raffel, Steve Raffel and Myself, making the games.
Now the 
company is pushing 50 employees. Besides being the Art Director 
and being in charge of all the artist, I have been involved in all
of Raven's game designs, Including Heretic, Hexen and Hexen II. And 
now I'm leading up Heretic II.

So with that out of the way, you now know that I have a little experience
in making awesome games. So I assure you that with the team I have, we 
will make Heretic II a $#@&ing kick ass game! 

Since the Heretic II press release we have been getting feedback from
our fans that they are dissapointed that Hereitc II is a 3rd Person 
Perspective (3PP) game. If your finding this out for the first time...
Yes, Heretic II will be 3PP. Not first person like the original. We did
this to give action game fans a different twist on action. We all know 
there is a flood of first person shooters out there so we thought we'd
offer up something different. There have been concerns that the game
will be Tomb Raider. WRONG!! Lets get things straight right now! Heretic II
is an "action" game. My goal is to retain the flavor and gameplay of Heretic.

Hexen and Hexen II started straying from the the hard core action but we 
wanted to give the player a different playing experience. But now we want
to go back to Heretic and bring back the action...but with a twist. Why the
twist? Because Raven is always trying new things in order to offer YOU the 
gameplayer something different than Doom and Quake! We are in a difficult 
possition as an action game developer. When we make a FPS, gamers bitch cause
we're just making a clone of Doom or Quake. So we try and offer different 
things for gameplay (see Mike Werckle,s plan). But when we do this, those same
gamers bitch that the gameplay isn't like Doom or Quake. There is never going
to be innovations in games if we don't try, and you the gamer will suffer.
 
 
You've all probably seen Romero's comments about the Heretic/Hexen franchise.
He is entitled to his opinion. But I have learned a lot from when John worked
with us on Heretic. And I plan on reverting back to those gameplay philosophies.
After all we are making this game for the people who love Heretic. So by all 
means we want to meet their expections. This isn't some obscure 
game that we put the Heretic lable on. This is a sequel, and we plan
on bringing back a lot of things that made Heretic so fun. We are 
bringing back the morph ovum so you can turn the enemies and your 
deathmatch friends into chickens again. We are also bringing back
some of the weapon spells. And finally we are doing the game in 3rd person 
cause it looks frickin' cool. We want to give you the action gamer
a new action gaming experience. I hope this calms your fears and I 
think you will be pleased with the gameplay.

We are making the game for you, so please give us your feedback.

OK, I'm done.

For now.
