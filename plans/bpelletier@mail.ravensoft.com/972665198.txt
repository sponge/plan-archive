Here is a question I got from a German magazine and I thought it would
be interesting to share.

(German mag) Most of the Elite Force consumers say that the game was 
a bit to short. What do you think about this? Why is the game so short? 
Are there any concrete reasons?

(Me) In my opinion, there are two possible reasons, and here is the 
first one:
Most of the consumers you're hearing from are hard-core FPS players 
and most of them are playing on Normal difficulty, which wasn't suppose 
to be the desired difficulty setting for them. This setting is actually 
the easy mode with challenging being the medium difficulty and what 
experienced players were intended to play. There is a HUGE difference in 
difficulty between Normal and Challenging. This is our fault in our use 
of terminology, as we originally only had 3 difficulties (Normal, 
Challenging and Hard, easy to figure out that Challenging is medium since 
there are only 3) and then we added the easy difficulty in the last month of 
the game development, which was basically an effortless difficulty mode. 
We left the terminology the same assuming most experienced players would 
play a game in a mode called challenging, but in hindsight if I saw a 
game that had a mode called normal, that's what I would play. This again 
is our fault for trying to be cleaver with our naming and also make the 
inexperienced gamer Star Trek fan (who wanted to play the game) feel like 
a "normal" game player.
From my experience with the game testers we had come into Raven, along with 
our internal testing and feedback we get from other average game players is 
that it will take well over 15 hours to play the single player storyline 
game for a casual gamer. The hard core FPS gamer takes a lot shorter to play 
because of the nature of how they play shooter games, which is fast, furious 
and running through the levels to get to the next. Average gamers are much 
slower and not as good, and since we are also creating a game for the average 
player and Star Trek fan, we didn't want to make it too hard for them. So 
because the game is a little easier to play for hardcore players on top of 
the fact that they are playing on easy difficulty, made for one of the 
reasons why I believe the game was short for those types of gamers.


I'll post reason number 2 on Monday which is more of a development and
technical issue and in my opinion the real reason of why it is shorter
to play than we wanted it to be.

About Elite Force's teammates.

We all know everyone has their own opinions and we have heard that 
Elite Force's teammates are revolutionary and surpass any teammates 
done for other games and we also heard that the teammates were nothing 
new and they had problems and didn't really work that great. I would 
have to disagree with the later and say that the teammates could have 
easily been a hindrance to the gameplay and now I know why no other 
company has ever tried to make a FPS game with up to five teammates 
Working alongside you at one time. At one point in the final stages of 
developing the teammates, I wasn't sure if they were going to work out, 
they just had so many problems and every time we would fix something 
another problem would crop up. Just getting them to follow you was not 
an easy task and something we tweaked with all the way up to the final 
days. Sure we could get them to follow you but the game took place in 
tight hallways and small rooms so you would be bumping into them, they 
wouldn't get out of your way, they would constantly get stuck on each 
other and they followed the player like a heard of sheep. Also making 
them always follow the player everywhere caused problems with them 
feeling like real intelligent characters so sometime we had to have 
them stand their ground or take up a position while the player went 
exploring. Then we had the consistent problems of the team not even 
following you and you might need one of them to open a door for you to 
later on and when we did get it to work someone eventually found a new 
way to break a level with a teammate. Plus with elevators and teleporters 
there were always problems with how a teammate could get left behind. 
It was getting to a point where we weren't even certain if we could get 
them to walk through an entire level and we might have to do something 
drastic. Luckily it never came to that and we were able to get them 
working in the levels. They may have ran funny to catch up to the player 
or jumped down long elevator shafts to stay in formation, but at least 
they stayed with the player through the whole level no matter what kinds 
of crazy stuff they player was doing. Then came the problem of trying 
to balance the combat with the teammates. We started getting our enemies 
in the levels and the teammates were so good they killed most of the 
enemies leaving not much for the player to do. So we didn't have them 
shoot as often but then THEY were constantly being attacked instead of 
the player, and the game combat became shoot the aliens attacking your 
teammates, which was not fun. So we had to balance the combat so the 
player still felt threatened by enemies attacking them and teammates 
helped but not to the point where they did all the work and eventually 
we got something that felt really fun for the player. It's funny now 
when I hear people say that the teammates were stupid because they hardly 
killed any enemies or that the enemies always attacked the player but 
hardly the teammates; If they only knew how not fun the gameplay would 
have been had we not balanced it out the way we did.
