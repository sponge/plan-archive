Elite Force shipping updates:

The CD's are being replicated and packaged as you read this.

Everything is on track for our scheduled ship dates. The world wide shipdates are as 
follows:

9/15: UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg and other Europe
countries.
9/19: US, Canada
9/21: Australia, New Zealand

These are dates that the products leave our warehouses and are shipped to stores.  
In store dates will vary by retailer.  Other countries will ship over the next month.

many people are asking why it's taking so long to get into the stores compared to when 
other games go GOLD. The reasons are many, but the main reason is that we were not in 
a rush to get the product in the stores because we were on schedule with our internal 
GOLD and ship dates. This way we can take the normal time to get them manufactured 
and sent to retailers without paying extra fees for express handleing & shipping. Had we 
been behind schedule, then we would have had to painstakingly rush the manufacturing and 
do express shipping to get it to retailers when we said we would and that costs a lot of 
extra money. Also it takes longer to manufacture and ship products overseas and within 
Europe and since we are doing a simultaneous release we have to make sure all versions 
of the game are ready for shipping.

Thanks to everyone for your enthusiasm and support and we know you will enjoy your playing 
experience.

Some poeple have been wondering where the interactive events are that we have been 
talking about. there are a few interactive events in the demo, where depending on your 
actions there will be different outcome. 
 
Spoiler - this is mainly for those who have played the game and didn't realize the depth 
of the events.
 
On Borg cube you come across two teammates being attacked by a Borg. 3 things can happen.
1)You can shoot and kill the borg saving your teammates. 
2)your teammates can shoot and kill the borg themselves (only if the borg haven't alredy 
addapted to your weapons) 
3) if you don't shoot the Borg attacking them and they Borg has addapted it will Kill your 
teammates. (shame on you:)
 
In the Voyager hallway on way to engineering, there is an explosion in the hallway ahead 
of you. A crewman in the hall is knocked down by the explosion and tells you to use the 
control panel to erect a containment field. 4 things can happen.
1) you use the panel and erect the forcefield but crewman is trapped inside it and the 
explosion coming down the hall kils him. 2)Wait for crew man to get to you and then use 
the panel erecting the force field, stopping the explosion, thus saving him. he then gives 
you useful information. 3) don't use the control panel in time and you are killed by 
explosion. 4) you don't use the panel and run down the hallway to the left escaping the 
path of the explosion but now a radioactive leak has spread through the deck and you slowly 
die of radiation poisoning.
 
after hall EPS conduit explosion, go down hall to Chell (the blue faced guy) and he tells 
you to use the panel to stop the overload. if you don't a small explosion will hurt the guy 
working behind Chell. If you use the control panel in time you stop the overload and Chell 
will give you informaiton of where to find the Jefferies tube (if you haven't already found 
it)
 
theres a few more too, you just have to think to yourself, what would have happened if I 
didn't do that. Well...then reload and try it differently.
 
Hopefully we've created a more rewarding gameplay experience.
 
Enjoy.

I am pleased to announce that the Elite Force Demo has been approved by QA tonight and will 
be ready for download from www.Gamespy.com later tonight. We sent the build to them and they
are getting it ready for your downloading pleasure. 

I hope you all enjoy the sneak peak at the game that we have all been working very hard at.

Please go to www.ravensoft.com/eliteforce to send comments about the demo. We would love to
hear from you and what you thought of the demo. keep in mind it is a very small portion of
the whole and you are only witnessing a fraction of the game.

As an update for the full version of the game. We are very close to beta and will be play
balancing the game in the next few weeks to make it as fun as possible. 


Later
