I had to write a .plan file today, to talk about the Elite Force comic book that is 
being created and published by DC Comics/Wildstorm productions. The Comic is a prestige
format book, which means it is printed on glossy paper with a thicker stock cover and 
48 pages long.

The Elite Force comic will be out in your local comic book stores and I beileve even software
stores by the first week of june. Only a couple weeks away!!

The comic is a "loose" adaption of the of the Elite Force game so they have taken liberties 
to change the story to fit into 48 pages. For the most part, the main plot and story elements
are in place but they focus on the Borg mainly, where in the game other aliens where invlovled 
instead of the Borg. There aren't too many spoilers in the comic and it is actually a nice 
companion to the game and in some case very religious to the game. I spent many many hours
working with the creative team on the book to make sure the story elements crossed over correctly
and the artist had reference for characters, locations and things in the book. A lot of the game 
dialogue script is used in the comic, and most of the hazard team characters are in the story, so 
it really does seem a lot like the game.

I've also worked closely with the creative team to add a few hints into the comic that will help
players when playing the game. 

And my favorite part is that 6 of Ravens artists working on Elite Force, including myself, did 
illustrations for the comic that will be featured in the back of the book. This is a treat for 
most of us since we did professional comic book work in the past and it will be nice to see our
work in print again.

We will put some of the colored pages from the comic on the www.ravensoft.com/eliteforce site so 
you can see a glimps of how great the comic looks. check it out in the fun stuff section by the
end of the day today, along with some of the other preliminary comic pages.

So if you want a sneak peak at the game, and a great comic book, go out and get it the first week
of June. The price is only $5.95us and is worth it since its the size of two comic books.
