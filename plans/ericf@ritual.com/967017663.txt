First I'd like to point out that Southwestern Bell sucks.  I put in my order for DSL
at my apartment about a month and a half ago.  They still haven't done anything.

Anyway, looks like the big bad crash bug in FAKK2 has been finally wiped out.
It's the strangest thing I've ever seen.  Normally a bug like that SHOULD crash
every system, but for some reason, through the entire testing session at Ritual,
we never encountered it.  Scott ran across it yesterday for the first time, and
that's all it took to track it down.  You can now get the patch 1.02a and it should
fix the crash bug, and a few slow down problems introduced in 1.01.

Gonna update my plan file for once.  First of all... Ritual rocks.

Second, I have to make "special mention" of some cool people. These are in no
particular order, so don't bitch at me if you're not first on the list!

Iceheart - Neat person.  Just beat Diablo.  Kinda goofy.
BaDmAn - Total sheep fetish.  Always wants Sally autographed and mailed to him (don't ask)
bass2496 - the "World Famous Programer of BassMod" (sounds dumb, but he wanted me to put that)
Iceheart - (again) because he's a pest and wants me to include him twice for some reason.

Anyway, all these wonderful *ahem* people are on IRC on the Enterthegame servers.
Just join the #ritual channel... but don't get disturbed if BaDmAn references sheep often.


Here's an example of the action in the channel shortly after I updated
this plan file :)

[BaDmAn] I like sheep.
[Iceheart] you spelled programmer wrong
[ArchV] DOH!
[Iceheart] "world Famous Progammer of BassMod"
[bass2496] Or Pro Gamer
[Iceheart] "these wonderful *ahem* people "
[Iceheart] You're funny Arch
[ArchV] I know.
[Iceheart] =)
[BaDmAn] You should be shot.
[ArchV] hehe.
[BaDmAn] :D
[Iceheart] who? me or Arch?
[BaDmAn] Both.
[Iceheart] eek!

Well, I'm here at 9:35am... my usual time.  The place is utterly deserted. That's a wonderful thing knows that the people that have been busting their asses on FAKK2 all this time are probably home alseep!  Me?  I got stuff to do... sorta.  I just want to say the FAKK2 team did an awesome job and lots of hard work and hard hours.  I guess I know what I have to look foward to!

On a side note, I've been hanging out alot on IRC on irc.enterthegame.com on the #Ritual channel.  Lots of cool people there... Drop by some time!

I defeated Diablo last night.  He's a pretty tough bastard.  Now I'm
halfway through Act I on Nightmare mode.  It's much much tougher. 
I'm really scared about Hell mode, if I can even make it there.

Been playing Dialbo II in my spare time. That's a pretty
awesome game.  If you need something to suck up all your
time and cause you not to eat for hours on end, play Diablo II.
