Look at that! It's 2002 already.

Hope everyone had a good Christmas.  I sure did.  I got lots of good computer hardware, Athlon XP 1900+, GeForce3 Ti500, and an 80GB harddrive.  Needless to say it's a gaming beast.  Not that I've been playing many games lately.  Wizardry 8 has kept most of my computer attention.  I highly recommend it to anyone that loves RPGs, it's a classic and probably one of the sleeper hits of the year.

Well, back to work on the project-no-one-knows-about... yet.
