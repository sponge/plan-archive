Been playing Fallout Tactics lately.  It's pretty well put together game.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes squad based RPG-type games.
Interplay DID just release a patch for it! Freakin' 75 meg download...  

Our new game here is progressing along quite nicely.  I'm more and more impressed every time I see a new level and graphics.

Interesting news.  Windows 2000 is supposed to be a stable development platform right? Well, in the last two weeks we've had to reinstall
Windows 2000 on my machine TWICE, including all the dev software.  It just seems to happen out of the blue, I'd come to work, boot the machine 
and it would bluescreen every time with something about "corrupted registry hives" and wierd stuff like that.  At one point after re-installing,
we installed the network drivers, hit "Finished" and it promptly bluescreened and reboot.  Needless to say I think something is wrong with my
machine :)

Ok, so my good friend's soon-to-be wife is looking at my plan file every day, and of course it hasn't been changing.  So I guess it's about time to update this thing which some info.

First of all, I'm officially engaged now.  Wedding won't be for another year at least.

I got a new car, 2001 Toyota Celica GTS, silver.

I'll probably get some webspace here pretty soon where I can post pictures of stuff :)

Oh happy day!

First of all, the Ritual Christmas party kicked ass.  I got a cool Julie (FAKK2) toy as a door prize.  My other programmer buddy Steven got a Love Ewe! Just like Sally!!  I was jealous.  So the rest of the week I hounded him for a trade... the Julie toy for the Love Ewe.  Today he finally gave in! So now I have my very own plastic sheep!! WOOHOO!! My girlfriend already told me I can't have it in the apartment haha... I guess I could hide the sheep in the closet... shhhh...

Have a Merry Christmas everyone.  BTW, if you play Everquest, looked me up, Strom Stillwater Povar server. :)

Badman (Steve) arrived today... he's going to do some great web work for us for awhile.
Maybe our webpage won't suck so bad after he gets through with it.  You can see
his other work at http://www.ritualistic.com
