Badman (Steve) arrived today... he's going to do some great web work for us for awhile.
Maybe our webpage won't suck so bad after he gets trhough with it.  You can see
his other work at http://www.ritualistic.com

Reading my plan below, I can now add that Southwestern Bell totally sucks.
I can't get DSL for my apartment because SWB has "repair issues" in my area.

Anyway, if you want to chat and hangout with a bunch of Ritual fanatics, come by IRC
on the Enter the Game servers (irc.enterthegame.com), and join the #ritual channel.

First I'd like to point out that Southwestern Bell sucks.  I put in my order for DSL
at my apartment about a month and a half ago.  They still haven't done anything.

Anyway, looks like the big bad crash bug in FAKK2 has been finally wiped out.
It's the strangest thing I've ever seen.  Normally a bug like that SHOULD crash
every system, but for some reason, through the entire testing session at Ritual,
we never encountered it.  Scott ran across it yesterday for the first time, and
that's all it took to track it down.  You can now get the patch 1.02a and it should
fix the crash bug, and a few slow down problems introduced in 1.01.
