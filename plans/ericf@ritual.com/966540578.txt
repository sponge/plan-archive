Gonna update my plan file for once.  First of all... Ritual rocks.

Second, I have to make "special mention" of some cool people. These are in no
particular order, so don't bitch at me if you're not first on the list!

Iceheart - Neat person.  Just beat Diablo.  Kinda goofy.
BaDmAn - Total sheep fetish.  Always wants Sally autographed and mailed to him (don't ask)
bass2496 - the "World Famous Programer of BassMod" (sounds dumb, but he wanted me to put that)
Iceheart - (again) because he's a pest and wants me to include him twice for some reason.

Anyway, all these wonderful *ahem* people are on IRC on the Enterthegame servers.
Just join the #ritual channel... but don't get disturbed if BaDmAn references sheep often.


Here's an example of the action in the channel shortly after I updated
this plan file :)

[BaDmAn] I like sheep.
[Iceheart] you spelled programmer wrong
[ArchV] DOH!
[Iceheart] "world Famous Progammer of BassMod"
[bass2496] Or Pro Gamer
[Iceheart] "these wonderful *ahem* people "
[Iceheart] You're funny Arch
[ArchV] I know.
[Iceheart] =)
[BaDmAn] You should be shot.
[ArchV] hehe.
[BaDmAn] :D
[Iceheart] who? me or Arch?
[BaDmAn] Both.
[Iceheart] eek!

Well, I'm here at 9:35am... my usual time.  The place is utterly deserted. That's a wonderful thing knows that the people that have been busting their asses on FAKK2 all this time are probably home alseep!  Me?  I got stuff to do... sorta.  I just want to say the FAKK2 team did an awesome job and lots of hard work and hard hours.  I guess I know what I have to look foward to!

On a side note, I've been hanging out alot on IRC on irc.enterthegame.com on the #Ritual channel.  Lots of cool people there... Drop by some time!

I defeated Diablo last night.  He's a pretty tough bastard.  Now I'm
halfway through Act I on Nightmare mode.  It's much much tougher. 
I'm really scared about Hell mode, if I can even make it there.

Been playing Dialbo II in my spare time. That's a pretty
awesome game.  If you need something to suck up all your
time and cause you not to eat for hours on end, play Diablo II.
