=============
Birthday is coming up soon... May 3rd.  Won't be very eventful since I'll be at work late that day working on a milestone build of our Secret Project :)

Might have found a house to rent in east Plano, that's pretty exciting. It's about time I get out of apartments, my poor new car already has TWO dings in the driver side door!

So, what do you think of this Wyeth guy eh?  He's doing a great job with the webpage and all.  He'll be adding alot of new exciting content to make it more enjoyable.  Might even turn into one of those pages you want to visit daily :)  His car is almost as cool as mine too... (hope he doesn't read this).  He also moved the plan-tracker to the bottom of the page.  That's kind of annoying... maybe I'll go kick him or something.
