Yes I'm at work on a Saturday.  But that's how it goes in the game industry.  Long hours and sometimes 6 days (or even 7) days a week, but DAMN, I build games for living! 

So I was at Outback last night with friends, and there was this woman, Lauren, who was quite a vampiric person I assure you, ordered her steak "pink".  I swear that cow had been dead no longer than a few hours.  So of course she was the target of all jokes for the rest of the evening.  Now you must understand this is a woman who presses down on the steak with a fork and says something like, "Mmm look at the juice squirt out".  Juice my ass, that was blood! ... and I doubt the blood was still warm because it was cooked!

Ok anyway, tip of the day: Well-Done is your friend!

Well my birthday went well.  I got a nice stereo system installed in my car, and I got cake from my parents as well as my fiance's parents.

Scratch that bit below about finding a house in east Plano.  I ended up finding one in Allen! I know 85% of the people reading this don't live in Texas, but if you MUST know, look it up on a map or something. :P  I'll probably be moving June 15th.  I'm going to use a U-Haul this time instead of 800 1/2 ton truck loads back and forth.  So if anyone has horror stories regarding U-Hauls, let me know before I use one.  (I didn't say Ryder, I know about the whole Oklahoma thing).

Don't know if you noticed, but after I kicked Wyeth around a bit, the plan tracking links are back up at the top of our webpage.  You see, he's basically my bitch.  If I want pictures of little furry pink bunnies on the page, THEY'RE GONNA BE THERE (Hmm, I gotta try that).

Ok, I guess I have to get back to work on this most excellent project!

Birthday is coming up soon... May 3rd.  Won't be very eventful since I'll be at work late that day working on a milestone build of our Secret Project :)

Might have found a house to rent in east Plano, that's pretty exciting. It's about time I get out of apartments, my poor new car already has TWO dings in the driver side door!

So, what do you think of this Wyeth guy eh?  He's doing a great job with the webpage and all.  He'll be adding alot of new exciting content to make it more enjoyable.  Might even turn into one of those pages you want to visit daily :)  His car is almost as cool as mine too... (hope he doesn't read this).  He also moved the plan-tracker to the bottom of the page.  That's kind of annoying... maybe I'll go kick him or something.
