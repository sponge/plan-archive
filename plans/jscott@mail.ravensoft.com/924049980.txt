13/4 (part the second)

I received a lot of emails on this subject. The code is indented
as I edit it, but the finger readers seem to strip out the tabs. The issue I was trying to raise was having the {'s misaligned.

The votes are as follows -
3 - 1 in favour of aligning
6 - 1 if you don't count emails ending in .edu
(a late vote threw out these numbers somewhat - Michael!)

Some quotes for -

You are so fucking right....
Couldn't agree more
I feel your pain.......
AMEN !!!

A quote against -

You're fighting K&R there, boy

It would seem that Universities teach it the misaligned way
because that is the way K+R has it. K+R rationalisation is that
you can see more code on screen on a 25 line monitor......

My rationalisation is that it makes it a lot easier to see
where your loops and conditions begin and end. It makes it more 
difficult to make a typo error. This is why I'll (and the rest
of Raven) will stick to this method. 

I know my editor has brace matching, but I shouldn't need 
to use it. If the braces are aligned, then I don't need to use
it. Less work, less bugs, more time writing new code.

I did however get many leads on programs to rebrace code. I haven't
tried any of these out tho....maybe one day.

13/4

Okie..pet peeve time (after looking at some *nix research
code). People who format their code -

if(condition) {
	Function();
	}

rather than -

if(condition)
{
	Function();
}

- should be tarred, feathered, hung, drawn, quartered,
disembowelled, shot and then stabbed for good measure.
Nested loops/conditions of this ilk make it extremely
difficult to work out which if/for refers to which bit
of code. As you have probably guessed, I've just spent
a good long time fixing a bug that wouldn't have 
occurred if the code was laid out in a reasonable fashion.

/me ponders writing a utility to fix such code.
