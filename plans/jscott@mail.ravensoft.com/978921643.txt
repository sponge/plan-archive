Please upgrade to the new HM demo code if you have not
already done so. We'll be taking the master server down for
the OLD demo next week sometime to reduce our support needs
and free up some resources on the master server machine.
The new demo uses the retail master server.

The winner of the poster and box is Thomas from Mansfield
in the UK. He should be receiving them shortly!

More CD key fun. It seems there was an anomaly when printing
out the CD keys (read: someone screwed up and is going to get
shouted at), and '0's were not printed.

The format of the key is XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-HH where HH is
a hex number and the only place where '0's can occur.
So, if you seem to be missing a digit at the end, put a '0'
in its place.

This will be fixed in future duplication runs.

Apologies for the inconvenience.

24/9

Just a reminder, do NOT send your CD Key to anyone. No one 
at Raven or Activision will EVER ask for it. Any request for
your CD Key is a ploy to steal it from you.

Treat the key as you would your car keys.
