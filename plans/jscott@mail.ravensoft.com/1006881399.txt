I've been working on a SoF1 dedicated server guide on and
off for some time now. Anyway, here is my first shot

If you have any suggestions, clarifications, additions,
please feel free to email me.

Good to see a lot more servers up since our last patch =)

We're very busy here working on an internal demo until early
next week. So, apologies for not getting back to a few people
with press quotes, technical questions, sof1 patch issues and
a FAQ I am working on - all should be back to normal next week.

We've just about recovered from killing ourselves making the
E3 demo... I hope you all like it! We're stuck up here in
Wisconsin with no way to get in touch with the boys at E3;
an email of your thoughts on Sof2 would be greatly appreciated!

The game is running at picmip 1 - so none of the textures are
displayed in their full glory. You really need a 64Meg card
to view them (even with texture compression), and I don't
think the demo machines have them.
