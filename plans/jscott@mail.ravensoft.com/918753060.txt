A sad day... a very sad day indeed.....


England v France

I almost put the air conditioning on today.. 60F in Feb in
Wisconsin ?!?! This is the state that defines summer as
3 months of bad sledding......

4/2/99

Most interesting 
Riva TNT tweaks

Although Heretic2 is not mentioned directly (grrrrrr),
following the tweaks for Q2 and Sin should prove ample
things to play with.

Soldier is coming along very nicely :) The menus are going
to be extremely usable, quick and extremely modifiable.

This game is going to be a modders dream.

I just gave up my local ISP for Earthlink. I get a much
better connection rate and a free 6MB of webspace. The only
problem is their web tech support is so slow. I sent them
a very simple request nearly a week ago and not even an
aknowledgement that they received it.
