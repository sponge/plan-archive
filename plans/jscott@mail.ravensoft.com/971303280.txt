We have a dedicated EF Linux server built. A kind gent is testing
it for us. Hostname isn't resolving at the moment =(

Watch this space! We're working on it.

4/10

A couple of EF stats for you. Yesterday we hit 400 thousand
MOTD hits (not quite up to Q3A numbers - but it's a start!),
and there are currently 100 Holomatch servers up.

SoF Gold patch - soon, very soon. 

28/9

More CD key fun. It seems there was an anomaly when printing
out the CD keys (read: someone screwed up and is going to get
shouted at), and '0's were not printed.

The format of the key is XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-HH where HH is
a hex number and the only place where '0's can occur.
So, if you seem to be missing a digit at the end, put a '0'
in its place.

This will be fixed in future duplication runs.

Apologies for the inconvenience.

24/9

Just a reminder, do NOT send your CD Key to anyone. No one 
at Raven or Activision will EVER ask for it. Any request for
your CD Key is a ploy to steal it from you.

Treat the key as you would your car keys.

As there is a Duke SETI team, why not a Raven team ? Sign up
