I`ve moved on to Soldier now.. but I`m still trying to help out
with Heretic2 support whenever I can :) I can help with video 
cards, compiling the tools and a few other generic things. I 
cannot help with design probs, load save issues or coop issues
(because I didn`t code any of these).

All seems to be going pretty smoothly with the Heretic 2 release,
not too many problems are being reported, but of the ones that are,
here are some common tips to help you out....

1. Always let Windows handle your virtual memory and make sure you
have at least 100Mb hard disk space free (200Mb recommended). Hr2
uses a lot of virtual memory when it is loading. Jake & Co will 
likely be addressing this for the EP.

2. If your video card doesn`t work, try the latest reference
drivers for your card. eg if your Diamond Monster II shows 
problems, download the latest drivers from 3dfx. The problem is
the actual chip used on the card is sometimes well hidden. 

3. Even if you have a p2/450 with a Riva TNT, you won`t 
necessarily get a low ping in a net game. Ping is to do
with the quality of your net connection, modem speed and
number of hops to the server.

4. We use VC6 at Raven to compile the game. Apparently, you
can compile with VC5 (with VS SP3), but this is not recommended.
The documentation is wrong in this case. If requested, I`ll
place some documentation up somewhere on some "how to" stuff. 
As I`ve been working on the stuff for 11 months , it all seems
perfectly straightforward to me, so you`ll have to suggest 
what you want me to publish info on :)

5. There is a problem with the joystick code. Certain joysticks
were broken in the demo, unfortunately the fix broke something 
else :( We are working on a fix for this for the 10 or so
joystick users. This will be fixed in the EP at the latest.

6. "unauthorised access" error in the demo. We accidentally 
left in some anti piracy code for the demo (ooops). You need
to download a new dll from the Activision site.

7. Linux version. We are all Windows peeps here at Raven. We
are extremely unlikely to do one, although subcontracting this
out may be an option. What is involved in doing a Linux port ?
All our servers are NT based, so testing would be another 
problem.
