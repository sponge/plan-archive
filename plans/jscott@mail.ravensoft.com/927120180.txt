A couple of E3 Raven things here

Cdmag mentions SoF briefly
http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/019/169/soldeirf_e3.html

I hear the Sof is also being shown at the a3d and 3dfx
stands, so if you can't see it at the Activision stand
for any reason.......

Pile mentions Voyager and SoF

Evil Avatar has some screenshots of SoF

Gamespot mentions Voyager (and the fact it uses the Q3 engine)

If anyone has any more Raven E3 news, we would all like
