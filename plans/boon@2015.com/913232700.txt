I'm going to put the date in the right way around in my .plan file because 
I'm not Amercian and hence don't suffer from the problem of trying to 
write things the wrong way.

We just got these plan file things today, and Magoo and Z and Paul are all 
huddled over their computers busily trashing each other.  Well, actually, 
Paul and Magoo are trashing each other and Z is busily defending himself 
from the spare flak that seems to fly off their trashing.  Z really does 
ask for it though - he's an English major and he spells worse than anyone 
I've ever met (quick note here, all Americans spell stuff wrong, and if I 
disregarded that then Z might be better than some Tasmanians I know).  
Heh, shouldn't judge a guy by how well he spells though, it's a shame for 
Z that that doesn't make a difference in his case...

Oh, a quick hi to all the Tasmanians out there :)

Here's some things people might find useful with animation names in .def 
files in Sin: 
The code which controls AI has some keywords it takes note of.  Some are 
obvious, like fire, walk, run, but there are others, like 
crouch_, and alert, which are cool too.  If an actor dies or 
suffers pain while in a crouch, the code automatically looks for an 
appropriate animation with the crouch_ prefix.  Alert is actually a form 
of idle: once an actor has been activated or whatever, they then use their 
alert animation instead of their idle animation, until their enemy dies.  
This can be really cool if you want to have a fancy set of idle and twitch 
animations, but want the actor to always keep his/her/its gun ready when 
he/she/it is fighting.
