Plan:
GameSpy -
    2.08 - There will be another build of 2.08 released shortly.  Found a
few mistakes in Tribes and added a couple things for HalfLife and Jack.
    2.10 - Combined 2.08, my 2.10, and Jack's 2.10 then cleaned up a lot of
the headers.  Incremental builds are really fast now. And 2.10 will not be
2.10.  I am pushing for 3.0 because of the number of changes.  We will see.
    Java - no progress.  Working on the above.

Web Site - finally finished my web site redesign. Learned a lot about HTML
and FrontPage Express.  I don't like it too much but it is not that bad
either.  The bad part is you must edit the HTML manually to fix things like
image paths. As for editting text and the format, it works rather well.  I
don't like FrontPage or InterDev at all because they insist on you having a
web server with FrontPage extensions. InterDev requires IIS also which means
NT.  Talk about overkill.  All I want to do is edit a simple web site on a
disk.  I have to find a good editor for the site.
