Plan:
Been getting some questions about Halflife.  Gamespy support will not
require WON access.  You should be able to set up your own servers, query
other master servers, the gamemaster server at gamespy headquarters, others.
Not quite sure how to set up the servers for this because I don't have
halflife yet.  Watch http://www.contaminated.net/ for possible answers to
these and other questions.

The networking is working for Gamespy Halflife support.  Cleaning up the
launch code now.  Joe will have to finish this because I am outta here for
the rest of my vacation.
