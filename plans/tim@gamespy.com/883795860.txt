GameSpy 2.0 progress support.
Just finished adding web proxy server support. I also found and fixed the bug where GameSpy would sit there at a QuakeWorld server and not connect.  It was a race condition I could not duplicate until now.

A few things about GameSpy Quake2 support:
1) Make sure you have actually added a Quake2 list server to the server lists tab in options. We have been getting a lot of emails on this.
2) If you get a message like "NET_SendPacket ERROR: WSEAWOULDBLOCK" from within Quake2, odds are pretty good it has nothing to do with GameSpy.  GameSpy either quits or goes to sleep while you are playing depending on the settings.
3) Please view the readme file.

Quake2 is awesome.  I bought mine yesterday. CompUsa has it for $37.99, limit one per customer.  Kill some alien badies this festive holiday season.
