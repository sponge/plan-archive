Halflife:
There were some questions about my last post concerning GameSpy support and
Halflife when I said "Gamespy support will not require WON access."
1) Gamespy does not require WON.  You can get your server lists from
anywhere Gamespy supports. The default master server though is WON's.
2) Halflife will require WON access until Valve decides to remove the
checks.  I understand why Valve did this.  There are some real jerks on the
internet.
3) If you have an Invalid identity problem in Halflife, it is probably
because the checks to the WON server are failing.  Try again in a few
minutes.  This is the reason why the WON checks are not such a good idea.
As more people get the game and play, these problems will only increase.

Sorry it took so long to post this.  Went to see my grandparents over
Thanksgiving and then got pneumonia.  The story:
1) Left Tuesday morning from Orlando and arrived that evening.  Felt fine.
2) Wednesday morning woke up with a sore throat.  Blamed that on my sister.
She started a cold exactly the same way about two weeks before.
3) Wednesday night, sneezing and runny nose.  Not unexpected.
4) Thursday morning, started coughing.  Not unexpected with a runny nose.
5) Thursday night. - I can not breathe well at all.  Wheezing.  Stayed awake
all night.
6) Friday morning - found an open doctor and went.  Severe asthma attack
with pneumonia.
The only good news is the pneumonia was found before it made me really sick
(no fever yet).  If I had stuck to my original plans, the results would not
have been good.  It also shows how quickly things can go from feeling fine
to really bad.  About 36-48 hours for the pneumonia from nothing.

GameSpy:
Needless to say from above, I have not done much.  I finished the JBuilder
(Java) tutorial while stuck on the couch.  Started designing GameSpy - Java.
Turns out the network engine design in GameSpy is very similar to what the
Java version will need.  Still have a lot to learn about Java.  Perhaps I
will post some results as I develop this.  Would be interested in seeing
where it will run and where it won't.  Sun is backing away from the write
once, run anywhere promises.
The problem with the JBuilder tutorial and documentation is they really
focus on databases.  Only a small portion of Gamespy is a database.
