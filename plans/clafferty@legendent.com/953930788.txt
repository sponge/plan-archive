It's been a while since I last updated. I've been working on various U2 things
I cannot talk about and trying, desperately, to get versions of the 
Wheel of Time International patches that can have our Q/A Stamp of Approval.
With all the various (but minor) differences between the US and Intl versions of
WOT this is turning out to take much longer than I had expected.  We _should_ 
have International versions ready to send to GT QA by Friday.

What do you think of the cool new U2 Image on the main page?

The Wheel of Time v333 patch has been released. You can grab it
from http://www.gtisonline.com/ftppages/wheeloftime_ftp.html. There
are several cool new features including player id and voting.  We are
also going to be releasing 2 new Arena maps today. One is the new map
that was included in the demo and the other is a brand new map created
by the Wheel of Time level designers.
