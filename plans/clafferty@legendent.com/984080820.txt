We are starting to pull back the veil of secrecy from Unreal 2! 

The April issue of PC Gamer is hitting news stands this week and features an awesome
6 page preview complete with the first screen shots to be released from the
game.  It's a fantastic article, so if you've been looking for some info on Unreal 2
I strongly suggest picking up a copy.

Lots of stuff happening on the Legend Web page front as well. Watch for the 
re-launch of www.legendent.com as well as the Unreal 2 "sneak peak" site 
in the next week or so.
