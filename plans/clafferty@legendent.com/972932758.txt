If you can't find the patch at the Infogrames site, we have posted a local copy
here <A href="http://www.legendent.com/patches/napali/unrealrtnppatch.exe">http://www.legendent.com/patches/napali/unrealrtnppatch.exe</A>

Once again, sorry for the problems with this patch getting released.  Things shouldn't be this bumpy in the
future.

OK, just in time for the weekend we have finally gotten the sign off on the Na Pali patch.
It should be showing up at the link below within the next few hours (hopefully sooner rather
than later).

Remember, this patch is for Return to Na Pali _ONLY_ (The Unreal add-on pack by Legend). This brings 
the Na Pali code base up to Unreal 226 along with the UT Interface. There is no need to use this patch
on Unreal Gold as it already contains the latest code. Thanks for your patience with us while getting this out,
unfortunately it was a bit out of my hands but for Na pali fans it is well worth the wait.

And from the "hey, it's only a game console" department comes this story on 
dailyradar about people getting out of control trying to get a PS2 from
Wal-Mart (and it happens to be in the town where I live). Must be getting close
to the holiday season.
