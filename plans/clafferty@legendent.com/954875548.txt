The International patches for Wheel of Time have been sent off
to GT for International testing. Once (if?) they approve them you should
see them on various GT web sites world wide. There is a German patch and
an International patch that covers all other versions (non-US).

I'm not one to express my personal opinions in plan files, as I have always 
had the "who really cares what he thinks" attitude about plan file updates that
are not related to the gaming industry.. But I have to say, Mr. Lucas, stop
milking your die hard fans and release the Star Wars movies on DVD!! $29 for
a "widescreen collectors edition" VHS tape is insulting to the very people
that made you as rich and powerful as you are today!!

It's been a while since I last updated. I've been working on various U2 things
I cannot talk about and trying, desperately, to get versions of the 
Wheel of Time International patches that can have our Q/A Stamp of Approval.
With all the various (but minor) differences between the US and Intl versions of
WOT this is turning out to take much longer than I had expected.  We _should_ 
have International versions ready to send to GT QA by Friday.
