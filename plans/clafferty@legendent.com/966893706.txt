Not a lot work related to talk about. Still can't talk about Unreal 2.
In other game news....

Seaman for Dreamcast is the most disturbing video game ever.

It's also the most entertaining to watch... Nothing like watching
a co-worker talk to a man-fish on the TV via a little green microphone
and then watching seaman insult him back!

Seaman....Seaman Jones.

"But I was wrong about Deus Ex. Do you hear me?
I WAS WRONG ABOUT DEUS EX. SHUT UP, CRAIG!" - Grant Roberts

Thank You! The defense rests.


Diablo II - This game rocks.. It is so simple yet so addicting. But
what is with the new trend of limiting the save game feature in PC games?
Putting constraints on a Save Game feature that require you to play for hours
or re-do what you already accomplished when you play again is just plain 
stupid IMHO. If I want to play a game with console restraints, I'll play a
Dreamcast game.
