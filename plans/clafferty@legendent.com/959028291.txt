Six weeks ago I sent the Wheel of Time International patches off to
GT International for testing. Good thing I didn't hold my breath. I think
at this point it is safe to assume the patches AND GT testing have been
sucked into a black hole or time void.... So, we have decided to just release
the patches and call them "beta".  I don't for see any problems, they just haven't
had the GT seal of approval stamped on them.. So, if you have the Wheel of Time
(a non-us version) you can grab the German or "other" International patche from
the official Wheel of Time site (http://www.wheeloftime.com).  They are linked
via Glen's update (under Current Wot News).  Also, we released a new d3ddrv.dll file
that is also available from the WOT site that should give D3D users a boost in both
Image quality and framerate. (Your milage may vary)

If you do run into any problems, please email me at clafferty@legendent.com and let
me know.  


btw - Does anyone know if they showed Metal Gear Solid 2 at E3? :)
