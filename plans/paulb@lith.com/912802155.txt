So the plan file is not doing so good. Either I have nothing to say or I’m waiting for the official dates and release to hit before I spill the beans. I’m working on the next set of press releases for our upcoming titles. We will be announcing two more acquisition titles in addition to the already announced Septerra Core. So prepare for the email press releases to continue from me. Septerra Core is one game I’ve been personally following and really excited about. Valkyrie has some really talented people working on this game. I remember Next-Gen print running something in their mag about Septerra with screenshots but couldn’t find it. It was awhile ago but if anyone can tell me what issue/page it was I would really appreciate it. After the next two announcements we will be unveiling our next title in development. This game is huge and uses the LithTech engine but ISN’T a first-person shooter. Some people had Monolith picked for a shooter only developer, but that will change. 

Just so everyone knows Blood2 PR/Marketing is being handled by GT Interactive since they are the publisher. This doesn’t mean that we can’t/won’t talk or answer any questions about it, however GT has all of the copies for reviews and promos. I still don’t have my final boxed copy of Blood2 yet, I still play from the gold. 

I read the GameSpot feature on Valve and Half-Life. It was fun to read something like that since we go through the same thing. The new PC Gamer has a cool 7 page Shogo strategy guide incase you where having some problems with it. It’s part one of two part feature so this issue only covers the first part of the game. 

Almost forgot to mention that the Rage of Mages level editor is out. Just wanted to let people know since a lot of people have been asking.
