Things going on with Anachronox:

The team just finished a mini-crunch for the most recent Eidos press-demo. Anox was very well received (of course). Everything is coming together quite nicely. I am trying to get a FAQ done for PlanetAnachronox. Russ Hughes came down from the Austin team and is making some awesome assets for Mystech and Battle effects. Other than that, all is well in the land of Anachronox.

Things going on in the personal life:

My roommate and I actually had NO problems with SW Bell DSL. They told us the date it would be on, and ta-da, it was actually up and running on that date. Simply Amazing.

The Zealot got me hooked on Tribes. We both tried to sign up for the Beta (along with Mr. Martel). We're trying to get ship-shape for Tribes 2.

Received my divorce papers in the mail. I'll be filing a response just in time for our 5th Anniversary. I find that only slightly karmic.

Got my personal website up and running. I think it is a decent first attempt. Of course, I had to practically pick Lucas' brain clean, but I learned a lot in the process.

Music I've discovered since moving to Dallas:

Jamiroquai
Orbital
David Byrne's Solo Albums

Movies I've seen since last update that I recommend:

Croupier
Steal This Movie
Nurse Betty
Almost Famous

So, Life at Ion is good. Two games out the door and one to go. 

I am a full fledged Deus Ex addict. I don't usually plug my own companies' games because I would obviously be biased, but this game is to good not to mention. I hooked, 100%. I have to have my Deus Ex fix daily. Unfortunately, I have to forsake sleep to get any playtime in, but I'm at the cathedral in Paris . . . and it's getting sooo good. I took the sniper route. I am one major badass with that rifle. 

Other games on my to do list: MDK2, Diablo 2, and S.O.F.

We've got sound effects in Anachronox!! Will and Darren have hit Anox at full steam after finishing a long, hard stint of Deus Ex sounds, which, may I say, were top notch. The artists are slapping them into the levels as fast as the sound guys can make 'em.

We've also made great progress on the battle system, and content is coming along quite nicely. 

For all you Stormtroopers out there, Lucas has been an invaluable asset to the team. He keeps our website going strong, even when all the Deus Ex fans nearly brought down the bulletin boards by posting so much. On top of that, he's contributed a lot to Anachronox itself. He is becoming quite adept with A.P.E.

Henrik recently completed a nice utility for QA that allows them to update their local Anox code for fast updates. 

Josh M. is recovering from a very nasty sun burn, and the entire team is chillin' out for the holiday weekend. 

So, I hope you all have a happy 4th. I plan on celebrating by watching The Patriot, and the traditional BBQ.
Cheers,
Andrew

So . . . Um . . . is this thing on?!!?!!???

Anyway, my first entry in a plan file - how exciting. Well, I came on board at Ion about 2 months ago as the "Production Coordinator" for Anachronox. Basically, I'm spending my days scheduling tasks, attending meetings, making sure that people talk to one another, and ensuring that nothing slips through the cracks so that we can get Anachronox to all you guys out there ASAP.

I came from Hasbro, Alameda Studio - formerly MicroProse - formerly Spectrum Holobyte, and may I just say a quick hello to Karen, Daniel, Van, Eddie, Chan, and DJ. You were a great group to work with. 

Anyway, E3 was awesome, MGS2 was awesome, WC3 was awesome, B&W was awesome, FAKK2 was, you guessed it, awesome, yada yada yada. You've heard it all already. It was nice to win an award. Tom, Squirrel, and I were all pretty much voiceless by the end. Rooming with Squirrel wasn't as bad as I thought it would be ;-) Also, Don, Berenger and crew, it was fun hangin with you guys. I have to apologize to LeeDot for not finding the God Lot girl of his dreams. And, if you're ever in the LA area, go to the Westwood Brewing Company. The servers are hot, and the beer is . . . well, awesome.

Nuf Said,
Andrew
