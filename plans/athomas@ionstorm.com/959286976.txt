		FRIDAY, MAY 19, 2000 - 1ST ENTRY
=================================================================

So . . . Um . . . is this thing on?!!?!!???

Anyway, my first entry in a plan file - how exciting. Well, I came on board at Ion about 2 months ago as the "Production Coordinator" for Anachronox. Basically, I'm spending my days scheduling tasks, attending meetings, making sure that people talk to one another, and ensuring that nothing slips through the cracks so that we can get Anachronox to all you guys out there ASAP.

I came from Hasbro, Alameda Studio - formerly MicroProse - formerly Spectrum Holobyte, and may I just say a quick hello to Karen, Daniel, Van, Eddie, Chan, and DJ. You were a great group to work with. 

Anyway, E3 was awesome, MGS2 was awesome, WC3 was awesome, B&W was awesome, FAKK2 was, you guessed it, awesome, yada yada yada. You've heard it all already. It was nice to win an award. Tom, Squirrel, and I were all pretty much voiceless by the end. Rooming with Squirrel wasn't as bad as I thought it would be ;-) Also, Don, Berenger and crew, it was fun hangin with you guys. I have to apologize to LeeDot for not finding the God Lot girl of his dreams. And, if you're ever in the LA area, go to the Westwood Brewing Company. The servers are hot, and the beer is . . . well, awesome.

Nuf Said,
Andrew
