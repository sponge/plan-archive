Argh! Plan File Server crashed, and my last entry never went out, so I am making a small update now. I hope everyone had a great holiday break. The Anox team is back from our small but much needed and deserved break. We will not be coming up for air until the game is done. Oh, and "Dude, where's my car?" has to be the worst piece of crap since Boiling Point. It's one of those movies you walk out thinking not about the money you wasted but that two hours of your life can never be returned to you. Ah well. I am saving all my anticipation for Crouching Tiger. More on that later.

Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukah! Happy Kwanzaa!

The Anachronox Team has been smokin' for the past few months, and I want to thank all of my co-workers publicly for their amazing effort. We've come a long way, and the game just keeps getting better and better. You may not be able to find Anox under the tree this year, but I promise you, it will be worth the wait.

The holidays always make me reflect on things I can be thankful for. I have a beautiful boy going on two years, and he will be discovering the joy of Lego's this Christmas. I also have a wonderful job, and I've made many good friends here in Dallas. I am grateful for all that and more.

The holidays are also a time for giving. Not many people know this, but my son was born with a rare genetic bleeding disorder called Hemophilia. Basically, it prevents his body from producing factor which in turn stops internal bleeding. The disease has almost become as treatable as diabetes, but it has a little ways to go yet. There are many great organizations to donate your money to during the holidays and throughout the year. Personally, I will be making a donation to the National Hemophilia Foundation. They work for a cure to hemophilia. If you want to help, you can donate online here:

By the way, I am in no way affiliated with NHF. I just figure, people read these plan files so I might as well put it to good use.

Well, I just basically wanted to wish everyone Happy Holidays!

Oh! and email Square at support@squaresoft.com. We must have Chrono Trigger on the PSX!!!!!
