I have been searching hi and lo for a good detective game -- is it possible this genre has not been tapped? I mean detective as in hard boiled fedora wearing gumshoes --- not Matlock. You know, the trenchcoat, starkly noir type of guy, always getting an eyefull of long games, kissing and maybe sometimes slapping dames, toting revolver, shooting tommy guns and maybe a shotgun on the rare occasion. And clues! And witty banter, see, a real clock setter.

I hereby declare that should I get the opportunity to make a game -- this will be it.

Also, what's up with Photoshop6? Am I the only one who thinks this program is a step towards squaring the wheel?
