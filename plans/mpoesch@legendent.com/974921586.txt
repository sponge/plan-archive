Current Project: Unreal II, Technical Lead


2000.11.22

We finally finished our final in-person interview yesterday.

We won't be announcing anything until later next week -- once we've reviewed our options and notified all the applicants.

A big thank you to everyone who has participated -- specifically, all the applicants who have put up with our rather arduous evaluation process, and all the sites that covered our announcements.

The search for Unreal II game programmers is continuing to go well -- lots of talented candidates have applied.

I want to focus on weapon coding for the next couple of days, so I will be procrastinating this round of evaluations until the end of the week -- there's still time to get your resume to me if you haven't applied already.

We're looking for one or two top programmers with the following qualifications:
- Demonstrated UnrealScript experience (mods, mutators, weapons, special effects, custom AI, etc.) is a must.
- Interest in developing game-code: game-play scripting, AI, weapons, and everything game-play related is a must.
- Experience in the game industry is a plus, but isn't required.
- Ability to communicate effectively and work well with a team is a must.
- Experience with C++ is a plus -- but, we will probably orient the majority of the tasks (80-90%) toward UnrealScript.
- Must be willing to relocate to Northern Virginia -- about 30 miles west of Washington D.C.

Send email with your resume and/or webpage with the subject "Resume: &lt;your name here&gt" to me at mpoesch@legendent.com  (Warning: I'll immediately delete resumes that don't include the "Resume:" header -- being able to follow directions is also a requirement for the position! &lt;g&gt)
