I have permission from Tim to open source certain parts of the engine
for the purposes of improving Linux support.  What I would like to
do is make available the code I have written for Glide, Mesa,
input, and audio.  I would appriciate Linux programers taking the
time to submit improvements to me at brandon@epicgames.com.
I will look into putting up a webpage for this and perhaps a
discussion forum.  Please email me your input or ideas.

I'm leaving to go home for Thanksgiving tomorrow, so I may not be
able to start on this until I get back on Friday.  Right now I'm
working on the Mesa renderer, because I would like to release that
soon, if possible.

The code that I open source will not allow you to really dig very
deep into the engine, but it will let you do a lot of stuff to
the renderer and X windows interface.

Since my time is split between non-Linux related projects, the Linux
port could no doubt be improved if it gets some attention from
experienced Linux programmers.

In the Unreal Universe interview I said that Epic was not going to be
persuing more Unreal patches.  I talked to Tim and he said that he
was going to release one more Direct3D update with the latest
changes/fixes and that would be it.
