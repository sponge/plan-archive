Plan:
I have to agree with Myscha, Heretic 2 is hella fun.  Alan, Myscha, and I
are playing through the campaign in coop.

Check out ruthless.com too.  I don't see too many people playing it online.
Its actually a lot of fun.  If you like Chaos Overlords style corporate
boardgames then this is a good game to check out.

Its 4:27 AM on Thanksgiving morning.  Holidays are so boring.  I bet
McDonalds isn't open today.
