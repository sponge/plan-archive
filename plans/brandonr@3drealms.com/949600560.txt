BLODU OK JARNA!

Bal-Sagoth IV: "The Power Cosmic" has been released in the US on
Nuclear Blast US.  If you like heavy metal, power metal, or black metal
and are into fantasy and science fiction you OWE it to yourself
to pick up this incredible album.  You can get it from amazon.com.
This is the best work of fantasy metal ever forged by the hand
of man or fiend.

Bal-Sagoth has signed a SIX record deal with Nuclear Blast, which
means FIVE more albums to complete the trilogy of trilogies.

The deal with Nuclear Blast means all of the releases will be available
in the US.  The original trilogy was released under Cacophonous.  A good
label, but with no US distribution.

Mayhap with All-Father Wodan's favour, we might see Lord Byron set foot
upon American soil to tour and spread his message of dreams and victory!

BLOOD FOR BOUDICCA!!
CARNAGE FOR CERNUNNOS!!

Note: "The Power Cosmic" does not contain any satanic references, in
case you might be discouraged from buying it for such a reason.

Other albums I picked up recently:

Dimmu Borgir, 
   "For All Tid"
Dimmu Borgir/Old Man's Child, 
   "Sons of Satan Gather for Attack"
Celtic Frost 1984-1992
   "Parched with thirst am I and dying"
