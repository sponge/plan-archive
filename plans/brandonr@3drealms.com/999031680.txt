Thought I'd pop up a short bit of pimpage for a game I've been playing lately called "Shattered Galaxy."  It's a weird little massively multiplayer online RTS that involves a lot of interesting strategy and customization.  If you like RTS games, it's definitely worth checking out.

In Shattered Galaxy you control a squad instead of an entire army and you don't build bases.  Instead, you focus on the advancement of your squad's experience and equipment and as well as the faction you are a member of.  I haven't gotten too far into the unit customization, but you can buy extra weapons and equipments for your units.

As they gain experience, your "hero" or squad leader character also gains experience that lets you buy more powerful units and equipment or field more units at a time.

So far, I've had a lot of fun with it and when you get into the really big battles the game shines.

It might go overlooked since the graphics aren't as high quality as many games, but it's pretty fun.
