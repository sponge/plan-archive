Answer for previous question:

Three threads are normal, it seems.  Apparently posix threads spawns
a third manager thread.  Good, I'm not going crazy :)  I got a couple
emails berating me for not reading the LinuxThreads FAQ.  Had I known
there was a FAQ, I would have read it ;)

Question for Linux Gurus out there:

If I create a new joinable thread (pthread_create) off of my main process,
should the results show up in ps as two entries or three?  I'm only creating
one additional thread to handle sound mixing, but I'm seeing three
"UnrealTournament" entries in the process list.  Its weirding me out.  I'm
pretty damn sure I'm only creating one process, so I wanted to make
sure the ps results were correct.  (I would have expected two entries.)
Chalk this one up to my newbiedom in the Linux world.

Anyway, the Linux port is doing very well.  Sound code is done except for
interpolating panning (right now panning is absolute and therefore very
abrupt if the player is spinning quickly) and a crash that I'm having a hell
of a time tracking down.  I just need to take a step back and dive back
in with a fresh perspective.
