Whoa.  What a game.  Epic whooped up on NetGames USA 71 to 43.

No help from the GreenMarine though, who pulled in 6 suicides and a measily 16 frags. Ouch!

Cliff snagged first blood and 3 killing sprees!

Check out the matchup:

Unreal Tournament will ship with out of the box support for statistics
logging and ranking using Net Games USA's ngWorldStats software.  The
software allows players to track their performance online at
ut.ngWorldStats.com.  You can track tons of different types of stats:
your kills, your best game, your total score overall, and so forth.

This Wednesday July 14, 1999 at 10:00PM Eastern, three Epic developers
are going to deathmatch three Net Games USA developers and put the stats
online at:

http://UT.ngWorldStats.com/Epic_vs_ngUSA/

So this is what we are going to do.  Everybody at Epic uses ngWorldStats
and ngStats quite a bit.  We think its going to kick some ass for organized
clan play and for big tournaments.  You can use ngWorldStats for watching
your individual performance online and you can use ngStats for LAN parties,
big tournaments, or even tracking your single player performance.

In order to show off some of the clan play goodness, we are going to have
the following setup.

- A 20 minute timed Team DeathMatch, 3 versus 3.
- The map will be DM-Grinder, a medium sized deathmatch map by "Myscha the Sled Dog"
- Epic's Team:
  * Brandon "GreenMarine" Reinhart
  * Cliff "CliffyB" Bleszinski
  * Alan "Talisman" Willard
- NetGames USA's Team:
  * Craig "BotanikA" Sparks
  * Jason "Rhea" Keimig
  * Mike "Dovienya" Swink

During the game we'll be taking screenshots to put up afterwards.  The stats
page will update immediately after the game completes and you'll be able
to see how everybody fared.

We think that ngStats is going to be a great way for teams to visualize
their strengths and weaknesses as well as archive their games.  Craig
and Brandon use it at LAN parties (put it on your LAN party server along
with a web browser and you have an instant game reporting nexus.)

Finally, UT supports Net Games USA's ngTCS - Tourney Control System out of the box.  
You can use it for LAN parties or big tourneys to automatically perform online 
event registration, match scheduling, interactive match brackets, and live game 
stat reporting.

Coolness!  So drop by http://UT.ngWorldStats.com/Epic_vs_ngUSA/ Wednesday
night to check out the game.  Also check out http://UT.ngWorldStats.com/
for a look at the world stat logging system and check out

Mark Rein, wanted to add his thoughts on the matter of web journalism, gaming 
news, and ethics:

"What I think makes these bogus reviews really bad is that they're looking
at old, out-of-date code and talking about it like it's a reliable version
of UT.  That means they're not giving reliable information about the product
which hurts our ability to market the game and their credibility.  These
guys should wait for the demo and review it and the wait for the full product
and review it.  We can NOT send out preview/review copies of Unreal Tournament
except in extremely rare cases that myself and Dan Harnett (at GT) anguish
over on a case-by-case basis.

I can count on ONE HAND the number of actual copies of UT we've actually
handed over to legitimate sources.  Any other legit previews have been
situations where they've come to see us (at their own expense), or to see
GT or to go to a trade show or event where we're showing the product and
they've seen it first hand.  There have been lots of those situations
(including Unreal web site hosts who came to visit us at OUR expense) but
we can never handle all the requests we get."

Mark Rein,
Epic Games Inc.

I might add to this that just because we can't handle all the requests
doesn't mean you shouldn't make them.  A part of being a successful webmaster
is using the resources that you have available.

So far my mailbox has been bursting at the seams with feedback from people
interested in this issue.  Nearly all of the readers feel that ethics among
web journalists is very important.  Most also feel that there are more ethical
webpages out there than I give credit for.  I think that's probably true, but
I will only speak for pages that I read.

On another note, Kenn Hoekstra of Raven Software says that the picture below
must have been taken in Madison, Wisconsin.  He says that the school "Fitchburg"
is a Madison area high school.

Gollywog from PlanetDaikatana says the dude tossing it uses the nick "Sex Cow"
and is a regular poster to alt.music.GWAR.  "Haven't seen him in a while,
but he's one funny mf."

Dan Sarkar showed me this picture.  I don't know who or where it is, but
its so cool I had to share it with the rest of the world.





I want to add to my 'rant' by saying that the two sites I refer to below
are not Unreal Universe and PlanetUnreal.  Neither of those sites are
what I would call "Independent."

Unfortunately, when you choose to focus your sites interests around a
single game you lose a lot of flexibility.  You lose the ability to say
things like "this game is cool, but could use work here and here."

People generally don't visit fan sites for reviews about the game the
fan site is focusing on.  Fan sites are a focus for hints, cheats, game
community information and so forth.  In order for them to do their job
properly they tend to sacrifice some level of independence.  Their webmasters
tend to work more closely with the developers.

I think that most gamers understand that.  Its not hard to realize that
when you go to a site like PlanetUnreal for information on Unreal or
Unreal Tournament you are going to get the most positive and optimistic
point of view.  They are trading some level of credibility for insider
information.

On the other hand, Blue's News started out as a Quake fan site and has
moved beyond that.  While Quake is still largely the focus of the site,
it has become one of the best resources for FPS gaming news.

Fan sites have to be aware of their role.  They need to present information
about the game...even promote it...without becoming the developer's spin
doctor.

Mia'Cova at PlanetUnreal presents an interesting point: Is it unethical for
a site webmaster to accept a plane ticket to see a game?  Under the APME code, 
it would be.  At the same time, a lot of these webmasters can't afford to fly 
themselves.  The question becomes "Can a webmaster maintain objectivity while 
accepting gifts from developers."  Most print media types would say "No."
I think that this might be a case where the print media rules may not be
entirely relevant to the world of online media.  There are a lot of (relatively)
high profile web sites that don't have the financial backing their print
media equivalents have.  You have to pay for a magazine, you don't have to pay
for a webpage.

Anyway, I'm just discussing my personal opinions.  There are ethics lawyers
and professors who have established
