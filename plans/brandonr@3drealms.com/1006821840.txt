I played a lot of Dark Age of Camelot this weekend.

Today I had a startling revelation.  It's like a light turned on inside my head.  All of this time I have been investing in these massively multiplayer games, from UO to DA, has been time I have lost.  I have not fulfilled my primary duty to myself: self education and self improvement.  Instead of spending my weekends programming or reading like I used to, I've been rotting away playing the same game over and over again.

I can't even claim it was done in the interest of experimentation.  I like to play a LOT of games and learn about what other developers are doing.  I think it helps in my work and helps inspire me...

But this MMRPG stuff has been pure virtual masturbation.  With no long term or respectful benefit that I can measure.

Why am I putting this in my .plan?  Because it seems appropriate to look back on all my enthusiasm for this genre and say "I was wrong, this has no value."

And so I can say to all the potential game programmers out there who are playing this stuff: put it away.  It'll kill you.  It'll drain away your ability to improve yourself and it'll dilute your primary passion: coding.  Instead of running home to code up a new idea, you'll run home to waste four hours doing nothing.

Programmers like to be idealists and massively multiplayer games feed on idealism.  They put you in a world where you can create and recreate yourself.  It is an addicting hypothesis!  One that gives you numbers and facts and items to manipulate and experiment with.  They give you an environment that can fulfill your need for experimentation and exploration while removing your ability to produce something that enriches you or others.

I canceled my various accounts and next weekend I'm going to think up a new project to work on in my spare time and work on getting myself where I should be.
