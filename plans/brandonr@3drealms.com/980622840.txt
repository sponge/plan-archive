That's a pretty good read.  Chad Moore is sort a punk in it, but he's got some interesting points.  Still, I'm not sure I'd go around poking BioWare, Ion Austion, or Blizzard with this particular stick.  Troika has a lot to prove.

Nonetheless, I'd argue that Diablo 2 isn't an RPG and that Deus Ex is a fusion RPG/FPS.  I hope that's not where Troika are looking for their inspiration ;)
