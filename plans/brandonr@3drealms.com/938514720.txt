If you run the Linux server and get an immidiate segmentation fault, it probably
means your machine is using libc5.  The Linux server requires glibc.  I have
no plans to make a libc5 version.  Upgrade!

Okay, the UT full demo linux server will start showing up on various sites for you
to download now.  I'm spreading it to some various sites for distribution and I'm
sure it'll find its way around the net.

In the morning we'll release the UT full demo.

Note: The full demo is not network compatible with previous versions.  You _must_
upgrade.  ngWorldStats will go online and only accept stats from updated servers.
There will be a 7 meg patch available for people with the 3dfx demo.

Here are the notes for the linux dedicated server.  This doesn't include any UT
338 release notes.  I'll see if we can get those on unreal.epicgames.com soon.

This doesn't include the linux client which will be released later.

Unreal Tournament Dedicated Server Readme

Bug Reports: utbugs@epicgames.com
Linux Specific Feedback: brandon@epicgames.com

Version: 338

I. Installation.

Currently, the dedicated server is being distributed as a tarball.  
Copy the tarball into the root target directory and unarchive it:

> gunzip UTDemo-337.tar.gz
> tar xvf UTDemo-337.tar

This will unarchive the utdemo directory into the current directory.  
I use /usr/local as my demo directory, but you might want to use /usr/local/games.

II. Starting a Server.

The best way to configure a server is to start a basic server and then configure 
it using the remote administration tool.  Change to the utdemo/System directory 
and edit the UnrealTournament.ini.  Do a search for the [UWeb.WebServer] section 
and set bEnabled=True.  This will enable remote server administration.  Start your 
server using the following command: 

> ucc server DM-TurbineDEMO

This will start a deathmatch server on the Turbine map.  Its important to use the 
correct case when specifying the startup map as the demo map check is case sensitive 
right now (this will be fixed soon).

Now that your server has started, open up Netscape and connect to your server:

http://127.0.0.1/ServerAdmin/

Username: admin
Password: admin

You can change the username and password under the [UTServerAdmin.UTServerAdmin] 
section in the UnrealTournament.ini.

Configure your server using this interface.  You might need to change the ListenPort 
for the server web interface inside the UnrealTournament.ini

Refer to UT documentation on unreal.epicgames.com for further information.

III. Stuff.

Stuff you _need_ to know.

- There is no ngStats or ngWorldStats for Linux yet.  Do not enable them.  If you enable 
them you'll probably get a crash when the level changes.  This will be fixed as soon as 
NetGames gets me a Linux version.  Definitely will be fixed for the retail version.

- When specifying a startup map for your server using "ucc server" use correct case.

- Sorry about the crappy documentation.

- Please email me (brandon@epicgames.com) any performance profiles you collect.  
General information on performance is also appriciated.

- The client is playable, but needs a performance increase.  I should have it in good condition when UT ships.

- I really don't want people sending me features suggestions.  I will be adding a console 
interface to the server.  I'm primarily interested in performance reports.
