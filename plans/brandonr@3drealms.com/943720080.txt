Answers to Linux problems:

A few people are reporting that the UT linux installer is
telling them "this installation doesn't support glibc-2.1
on x86" when it does.  You can get around that by either
copying the files listed in setup.xml by hand and then
opening the tarballs into the UnrealTournament directory,
or by calling the X installer directly:

./setup.data/bin/x86/glibc-2.1/setup.gtk

I hope to release a new version of the Linux stuff soon
and I'll fix the script that wraps around the installer.

Also, John Drohan points out that the installer needs
libglade and libxml installed.  I, being the quintessential
Linux newbie, thought these were standard.  Of course
not!  Nothing is EASY in Linux.  Well, I'll include those
libs with the next distribution, which should be coming
around soon.

If you have render error messages, delete Default.ini,
and UnrealTournament.ini.  Then copy LinuxGlideSystem.tar.gz 
into your UnrealTournament directory and open it.  Then 
run the game again.  It appears the permissions are wrong 
on the original Default.ini, so installing as a non-root
user fails to overwrite the file with the glide config.
I haven't confirmed this, since I just got back from
Thanksgiving and haven't looked into it.



By far the largest number of reports are about the
glibc-2.1 problem.
