Project:
Unreal Tournament
Plan:
Hakeem begged me to post a link to his
UT vs Q3 discussion at Excess Reality:
http://www.xsreality.com/articles/software/q3ut/q3ut1.asp

Hakeem kicks ass so I figured I would comply.

In the future, though, maybe I should take money
from people who want to pimp stuff in this space. ;)
