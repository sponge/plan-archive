Okay, the version of ngStats in the 3dfx demo has a problem with it.  It causes
the player's name to show up wrong when you view your stats.  The NetGames guys
are putting together a fix and will have a new ngStats for UT distribution
on their website soon.  Probably before the demo hits the net.  I'll update
my plan and our various webpages with the URL when its available.  Only
people downloading the 3dfx UT demo and playing with [local] ngStats will
need to get this fix.  I suggest you get it when its available because ngStats
is cool and fun to play with.

What else?

When you first play UT make sure you pick a skill level that suits your abilities.
UT's first four skill levels are easier, so that if Joe Average buys the game he
can have fun without getting spanked by the bots.  If you play online, chances
are you'll want to pick one of the top 4 skill levels.  In the full version of UT,
the skill level will ramp up as you play.  In the demo it does this a little, but
because there are only 5 maps is hard to feel the ramping.

I'll mirror this update on the techpage.

The in-game News Page will report information on the status of the NetGames fix
once it becomes available.

--------

The demo is in 3dfx's hands.  They'll release it once they and their partners 
are ready to handle the demand.

Server operators should check out the remote admin tool in the demo.  You can
turn it on under "Networking->Web Based Server Administration" in the advanced
options dialog.

When its on and you've set your username and password, surf to
http://YourServersIP/ServerAdmin to log in.

Server Admins should probably run servers with a playerlimit of around
8 to 10.  The deathmatch maps in the demo aren't really large enough to handle big
free for alls.
