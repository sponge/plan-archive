-- Make Something Unreal Contest

Cool, DarkViper took care of it.  Rock.

-- Fun with windows Key Caps.

Evil will get a kick out of this one.  While at E3, Jack
and I went over to the gamespot web machines to read
the news.  They had removed the keyboards so you could
only go to GameSpot sites and related links.  So before
we left we used the Windows KeyCaps program to set one
of the web machines to www.evilavatar.com.
