Just a short rant:

When playing Morrowind I highly recommend that you thief/assassin types don't freely assassinate everyone that you see.  Just because you CAN kill them doesn't mean you SHOULD.  I'm not talking from a moralistic point of view, but a profit driven one: If you kill someone that might factor into a future quest you are greatly reducing your chances of acquiring quest rewards later.
