-- The Law of Action Figures

The Epic office is now under "The Law of Action Figures."

1. A person shall not touch another person's action figures without asking.
2. If a person jars or upsets the poses another person has placed their action
figures in, that person will NOT attempt to adjust or correct the damage.
(Doing so risks causing more damage.)
3. If a person jars or upsets action figures, that person will immidiately send
an email to the action figures' owner cited all affected figures and the
amount of damage caused.
4. Action figures have small pieces.  If a person upsets small pieces that
person will ensure that no such pieces are left on the floor.
5. Under no circumstances will a person place action figures in lewd or suggestive 
poses without the consent of the owner.

-- Notice to all Idiots

People that complain about the lack of server support for a stolen beta
of a game that hasn't been released yet are dumbfucks.
