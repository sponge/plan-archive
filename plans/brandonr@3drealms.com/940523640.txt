Is this not the lamest bunch of crap you have ever read?  I strongly
oppose the implications suggested here.  Dr. Carmotta is saying that
geeks are attracted to loser girls.  What the hell is that about?
From my experience geeks (using the Slashdot definition) are attracted
to intelligent, self-confident, insightful women who know what they
are about.

Sexual predators and wife abusers go for the nervous, self-aware,
slumpy type.  Geeks go for the girls who have sharp minds and
the desire and ability to express it.
