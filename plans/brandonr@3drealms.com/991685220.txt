I've got thousands and thousands of Magic the Gathering cards I'm going to be selling.  Probably mostly through EBay...but I've got quite a few complete sets from the Dark and up to recent sets, so if anyone is interested in any of this stuff give me a shout.

In addition, I've got 1 extra Duke Nukem / Max Payne trailer DVD from my personal alotment.  I'm willing to sign it or have the team sign it and trade it for AIC stamped cels of Washu.

I haven't played magic for a couple years, but I've still maintained my set.  Now I want to offload it all to raise cash for my Washu cel collection.

If anyone is interested, just send me an email.  I'll be putting together an inventory of the cards next weekend or so.

I'll pay a lot for a good AIC stamped Nurse Washu cel with pencil sketch, if anyone has one.  I'm also looking for a AIC Washu cel with sketch and background from the ending of the Tenchi OVA where Washu tells Ryoko "I know what you feel...about Tenchi."  I don't even know if it's possible to get that background.
