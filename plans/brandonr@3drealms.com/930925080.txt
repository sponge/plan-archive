Afternoon

I'm selling a block of 3 Pokemon starters on EBay:

Morning

If any Kingdoms players have information on how to break
a Zhon stone giant blockade, I would be much appriciative.
None of the other races seem to have a unit or weapon
capable of stopping them.

I tried to use the Veruna last night against Lord Talisman,
but not a single unit was capable of putting even a dent
in his defenses.

Unlike Total Annihilation or StarCraft, this game seems to
be won and lost upon the construction of your base.  The
Zhon having a strong advantage in the fact that they
don't need one.  A stone giant is a walking wall that
also serves as an artillery piece.
