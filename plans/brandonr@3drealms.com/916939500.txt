Hey, I'd just like to say my comments on the MegaBoard were not an attack on Blue or a devaluation of what he does.  I really respect Blue and dig the site.  I fucking check Blue's News 15 times a day (literally keep a window open while I'm working...yeah I know I'm an addict).

When I said what he quoted I wasn't being smart.
