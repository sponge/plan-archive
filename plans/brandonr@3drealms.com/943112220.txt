Actually, nevermind assuming /mtn/cdrom.  That's just lazy.  I'll
make it ask you for the CD directory. :)

The tarball of Linux UT will include Loki's installer.  It'll assume
you have the UT cd mounted at /mnt/cdrom.  I'll have info in the
README on how to change the cd path and so forth. 

Congrats to Gearbox for a kick ass addon.  Op For was a pleasure
to play through (I played it all last night until I had beaten it).

Who the hell is Brian Reinhart?

Please stop sending me pro-Linux hate mail people.  I don't have
any say in GT's marketing decisions.  I just write the port.

Understand this again: This was not my decision.  I am not an
operating system advocate.  I am more or less indifferent to the 
OS debate.  I just want to program.

Originally this update was much more aggressive.  I'll simply
say this:  I feel that the Linux community is intensely detatched
and unrealistic about how it approaches games developers.
