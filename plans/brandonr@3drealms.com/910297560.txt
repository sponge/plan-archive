Plan:
In other news, I purchased the Alternity gaming system.  Interesting, but
the four character classes seem rather limiting.  There is some great art in
these books.  I'll maybe post more thoughts on the system later, if anyone
cares.

Currently have a huge load of games I'm playing:
Sin
Shogo
Fallout 2
Rage of Mages
Independence War
Starcraft
Parasite Eve
Xenogears
Ultima Online: T2A
