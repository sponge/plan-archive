If you are interested in C++ programming with the UT open source,
please join the openut-development list at sourceforge.  We are
getting into some nitty gritty details that will definitely help
programmers get to know the Unreal engine.

In fact, licensees might be interested in joining as well.

You can find the list signup at openut.sourceforge.net on the root
project page.
