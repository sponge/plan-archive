Any Ultima Online fans out there should make sure to check out the
latest audio shows from Forward Artillery.  Forward Artillery #4 is
titled "The Rise and Fall of Siege Perilous" and discusses the wild
past 7 days during which OSI created heaven and banished it to hell.

A new F^A show has just been debuted.  The UO Network News is a comedic
look at UO players today.  Your host Richard Harrison takes you on
location in Britain and Delucia to get the top stories in Siege Perilous.
