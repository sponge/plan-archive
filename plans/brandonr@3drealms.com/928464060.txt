Here is my worklog for today:

- A cursory frobbing of the UVar indicates that the RMask wasn't moggled properly.
- Remoggled the RMask.
- Ran a test on the bilinear mode switching channel.
- Wrote a utility to scan random memory addresses for polarity violations.
- Removed the focus module from core.
- Changed the engine switches. They should now romulate in a more hardware friendly fashion.
- Reimplemented the morphmodule interface.  How could I have done such a bad job in the first place?
- Replaced all occurances of "int" with "INT"
- Found a bug in the TCI fader.  This will be a tough one.
- Added a new function: PopMicronStack() that will pop the micron stack when called.
- Discovered that the CD burner wasn't working right because someone had placed a piece of balony in a caddy.
- Ate a piece of balony.

All in all it was a good day, I got a lot of tough work done.
