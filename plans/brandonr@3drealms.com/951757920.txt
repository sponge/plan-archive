I gotta say "Good Luck Zoid!"

I remember when Quake 2 CTF was first released I stayed up all
night playing it.  I had a comp sci test the next day.  I was
30 minutes late for the test, but was the first one done.  A couple
weeks later I decided to drop out of college and dedicate all
my time to working on games.

Zoid has definitely had some very visible achievements in the
First Person Shooter arena.  You can see the influence of his
ideas in UT.  Four of the Relics in the bonus pack were based
off of Zoid's original Runes.

Zoid's original Quake CTF mod more or less demonstrated that a good
modification could be of top notch professional quality.  GameSpy.com
is running "mod author week" this week and the opening paper is by me,
about the problems that face mod authors.  Give it a read.  The mod
scene has come a long way and has a long way left to go.

So hats off to Zoid and hats off to all the mod authors currently
out there walking in his footsteps!
