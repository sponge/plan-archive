If you haven't go see "Blade," Goths will love it.  Of course,
the side of evil loses, but Goths should be more concerned
with the fact that killing is taking place, not which side
is getting killed. (Hehe)

Great chat about Wheel of Time today.  Very cool.  The Legend
Entertainment crew kicks ass and takes names.  I can't wait to
play this title.  PlanetUnreal has a transcript of the chat,
if you wanna get the inside scoop.

What Myscha says is true.  Been happening to me too.
Somebody has been emailing mod groups saying they are me.
Saying stuff like "I love your mods, I like to work
on your project."

Realize, that if you receive mail from me, it'll either
come from green@idir.net arkiva@eagle.cc.ukans.edu or
greenmarine@planetunreal.com.  I'm also not working on any
projects but my own and Epics at this time, so if you get
an email like this it most likely isn't me.

Also, note that while it is possible to fake the From: field
on a message, if you look at the complete header you can check
to see if the originating server is one of the above.

I'm a game addict.  If a new game comes out, I buy it.
I'll probably go buy Get Medieval! tonight, just because
of the positive comments I've heard about it. 

I haven't seen a lot of screenshots or reviews or anything about
it, but the game seems to be moving by word of mouth alone.
That's cool...man I remember playing Gauntlet on my neighbor's
Nintendo.  Way way back when I was in grade school.

Is it just me or is CIH out of control?  Maybe its just CIH hype,
but there seems to be a lot of "Oh dear, that patch/file/binary/library
we sent out is infected with CIH.  Sorry."  

I don't think I've had a virus since I got this "Don't Panic" virus
on a macintosh way back when I used Macs.  (Hehe).  Every 15 minutes
the computer would say "Don't Panic" and that's about all the virus did.
Pretty cool.

Shout outs to Martin Fitzgerald.  A.K.A. "Brother Kato" of The Brotherhood Clan.
Martin introduced me to the concept of "thinking for yourself" as well
as good taste in punk music.  Keep kicking ass and taking names, Marty.

The Texas Martini Foundation is now at

There is a pretty good little rant up there about the end of the Quake
era.  That era ended for me about seven months ago when our local
LAN parties switched permanently to Quake2.  Recently, however,
we've even been playing less Quake2 and more games like Starcraft.

Nonetheless, I think the statement "The id era is at an end." is
a little strong and a little early.  Certainly more gamers are turning
towards the many new gaming alternatives in the FPS scene.  BUT,
id has shown in the past a strong capability to give the competitive
gamer what they want.  I doubt that will end anytime soon.

Sure, the PGL and CPL can't push Quake forever, but that doesn't
mean they won't push something.  Hell, I think it would be more interesting
and exciting for the PGL and CPL to push the latest and greatest instead
of a single game.  First, it would mean that the "best of the best"
would always be changing...instead of a small group of super elites
you get a different top player every six months :-) Lots more people
get a chance to play that way.  Occaisionally you might even get a
player who amazes everyone by kicking ass at say, Quake Arena, StarCraft 2,
and Rainbow 6 at all once.  Or something.  Sounds a lot more exciting
to me than watching Quake matches.  Quake is just kind of boring compared
to Quake2 and Quake2 will probably be just kind of boring compared
to Quake Arena.  Or SiN.  Or Half-Life.  Or Unreal.  Or the next cool
thing.  (Rainbow 6!!)

I know a lot of die hard Quakers don't agree with this, but I still have
the suspicion that that is because these die hard Quakers suck at
other games and don't want to lose their position at the top of the
chart.  Too bad.

Its like brutal gladiatorial combat.  Not too many heroes stay alive
long, but the ones that do are truly the best of the best.  Sure,
you might kick ass with the Rocket Launcher , but what are you gonna do when
the new kid in town packs a Flak Cannon, or an ION Blaster, or an
M-16A2? Or a little animal that chases you around the arena and bites your
toes? (hehe)

My point is that the great thing about computer games is that they
are always changing.  There is always a new graphical experience,
a new weapon, a new level, a new world.  A new game.  This isn't
basketball...its not going to be the same damn thing in 100 years
that it is now and groups like the CPL and PGL have to realize that.

"Cyberathletes" can't just be good at one game...they have to be
able to run the decathelon.  Not only would such criterion make
for more interesting and entertaining tournaments, but it would make
the competition for top seat much more cut throat.  The best wouldn't
just be the best at Quake.  They'd be the best at games in general, which
seems to fit the definition of "Cyberathlete" much better.

On the CD Rack:

Rammstein,  "Herzleid"
Rammstein,  "Sehensucht"
Black Flag, "Everything Went Black"
The Clash,  "The Story of The Clash"
Crass,      "Best Before..."

Anyone who says The Clash aren't punk can die a horrible burning death
for all I care.
