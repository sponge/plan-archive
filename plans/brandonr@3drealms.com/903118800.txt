Project: Getting everything in FF7.
Plan:
A guy named Rob told me about a really cool program called GetRight:
http://getright.com/

It interfaces with your browser and handles downloads.  It lets you
pause a download if you go offline and instantly resume later.  Its
GREAT if you are a modem user and you find yourself unable to complete
large downloads because your little sister wants to talk to her
stupid little friends on the phone.  :-)

Another cool thing about GetRight is that it can interface with your
Virus scanning software.  It'll automatically run a scan on the file after
its downloaded.  Pretty cool.
