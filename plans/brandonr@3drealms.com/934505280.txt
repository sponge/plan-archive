I'm almost done with System Shock 2.  I just bought it two days ago.  Its amazing.
I can't stop playing it.  The graphics are great, the rules system is great, the
combat is great, the level design is great, the sounds are fucking awesome.

The quality of this game is top notch and its a worthy successor to System Shock
(my favorite game of all time).
