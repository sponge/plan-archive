Plan:
Whats up with Blue posting that damn quote of the day?  When I said that I was very much in the wrong and started a whole series of flame wars on the MegaBoard.  Yuck.  I've already apologized and worked out the issue with people on the MegaBoard...but Christ.  When I pulled up Blue's this morning and scrolled around and saw that I was just like "Oh man, what the hell."  Its the kind of thing that makes you turn cold inside.  Stress from this job is going to drive me fucking crazy.  But its all shit I bring down upon myself.  Reminds me of that Gorilla Biscuits song "Big Mouth."  "You've got a big mouth, and I wish you'd just shut it up."
