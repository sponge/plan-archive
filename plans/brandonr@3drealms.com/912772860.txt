Stay tuned.  Word has it Epic MegaGames is going to change its name to:
"Epic Mega Kill-For-Fun Murder Simulations"

John Sloan, spokesman for Konami, makers of Metal Gear Solid, said he's
surprised to even find their game on the list. "It's rated 'Mature,' for
adults. We didn't make it or market it for kids at all. It's a video
equivalent of a high-octane, R-rated action movie."

Damn straight!  AND IT FUCKING KICKS ASS TOO!
