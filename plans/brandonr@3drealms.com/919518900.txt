Plan:
Wow, yesterday was the 1 year anniversary of Quake 2 CTF?  I remember
staying up all night the night CTF came out, playing online thinking "Man
this rules!"  I was an hour late to a comp sci final the next day and was
still the first one done.  (I dropped out a few months later.)  Quake 2 CTF
rocks.

Between Quake 2 CTF, Loki's Minions and Rocket Area 2 I missed so much
fucking school.

Thanks for the cool mod Zoid and happy birthday!
