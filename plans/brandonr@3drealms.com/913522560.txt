Plan:
Unreal 220 is out!  The response in #UnrealED has been phenominal.  Some
people are saying this is the rebirth of online Unreal.  I certainly hope
so, because it really is a lot of fun.  Dust off your Unreal CD, download
the patch and give it a try!  220 has new sounds, better netplay, better
interfaces/menuing/scoreboards.  A lot of fixes users asked for.  If you
don't like it TELL me.  Email brandon@epicgames.com and tell me what you
don't like.  Offer suggestions (please not flames, but suggestions) on what
you want to see done to Unreal.  We do listen, and 220 is a combination of
bugfixes and features suggested by players.  Thanks for the support of
everyone in #UnrealED and all the fans!  We really feel Unreal is now at a
great, solid state for online play.
