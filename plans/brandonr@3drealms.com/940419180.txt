Ah, nevermind.  I'll just find people to mirror it this afternoon or
leave someone else an email and when the other programmers get in
they can take care of it.  I've been awake for 25 hours now and
only had 6 hours sleep before that.  My hands are starting to shake
and I've got a meeting at 5 pm.  I either go to sleep now or stay awake
until 5 pm.

Linux client is ready to go.  I just need to arrange to have some places
mirror it.  This is the Linux UT demo with both client and server.
Linux server operators will want to download this to upgrade.

The download is something like 55 megs.

Watch unreal.epicgames.com that's where the news will go first.


I'm mega nervous about this release. :)  Send all feedback to
utbugs348@epicgames.com for now.  utlinuxbugs@epicgames.com will be
up as soon as Jack gets in :)
