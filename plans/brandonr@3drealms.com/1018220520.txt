OH MIGHTY GAS POWERED GAMES.  HOW I WORSHIP YOU.

My archer, Teflon Bill, has been adventuring all weekend in the multiplayer world portion of Dungeon Siege with Err the Bastard Lunatic.  We just went through an amazing series of events.

I found a huge tower in the middle of nowhere.  I explored the tower, killed lots of stuff.  Found a lift.  We go down the left.  Find island.  We explore island.  Find hell.  We die a lot in hell but gain experience fast.  Eventually we are forced to flee.  We explore island.  Find temple.  We explore temple.  Find desert.  We run for a long ass time in the desert until we find a statue.  Turn, run direction of statue. We find another statue.  Turn, run direction of statue.  Find new area.  Explore area, die a LOT.  Find teleporter.  Find last city with Utraen circle.

Wow.  This game is immense.  I can't imagine how much work went into creating the world.  Our full group explored from the starting city to the fourth city and Err and Teflon have been exploring on the side.  Man.  The game is insanely, utterly, amazingly, endlessly huge.  I have no idea how much stuff we haven't seen, but its an absolute blast exploring.

Somehow we went from the Great Northern Forest to a desert that I'm pretty sure is really really far away and the monsters can kill us with one hit.  But it was really fun finding our way there :)

I hope the Dungeon Siege engine doesn't sit idle.  It's too pretty and clearly too powerful to not get licensed or something.  I really would like to play a full story based RPG in this engine.  Yes yes yes yes yes I would.
