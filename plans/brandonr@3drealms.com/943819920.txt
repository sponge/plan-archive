I'm working with DeWitt Clinton (who wrote the Linux UT installation
instructions webpage) to test and fix issues with the port.  One of
the things we have found is that you need to have Joilet extensions
compiled into your kernel in order to see the long filenames
on the UT CD.

Joilet extensions are enabled by default in most distributions,
but if you have customized your kernel, you may not have them
included.
