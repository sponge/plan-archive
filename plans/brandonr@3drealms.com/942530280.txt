Christ, I sure hope Drizzt isn't in Baldur's Gate 2.  I hate
that guy.  I'm so tired of stupid punks at the gaming shop
always wanting to be a freaking dark elf.

Who thought that guy up?  "Let's make a cool culture that thrives
on evil and murder and then turn it all upside down by making
one of them a good guy!"

If Drizzt is in Baldur's Gate 2, I'm gonna frag his ass with
a couple magic missiles to the cranium.
