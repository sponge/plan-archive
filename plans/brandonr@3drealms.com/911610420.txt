WHOOP!

I beat Half-Life after 18 hours of play.  One 15 hour increment and one 3
hour increment.  Great job Valve!  This game is more fun than Doom and
System Shock and is easily my new favorite game of all time.  The ending is
great!! I CAN'T WAIT FOR HALF-LIFE 2!!!!

VALVE RULES VALVE RULES VALVE RULES VALVE RULES!!!!!!!

(Yes, I beat it on the difficult skill level, I'm not a pansy.)
