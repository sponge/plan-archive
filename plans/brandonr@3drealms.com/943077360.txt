Who the hell is Brian Reinhart?

Please stop sending me pro-Linux hate mail people.  I don't have
any say in GT's marketing decisions.  I just write the port.

Understand this again: This was not my decision.  I am not an
operating system advocate.  I am more or less indifferent to the 
OS debate.  I just want to program.

Originally this update was much more aggressive.  I'll simply
say this:  I feel that the Linux community is intensely detatched
and unrealistic about how it approaches games developers.

I am really trying to restrain myself from saying very bad
things in this plan update.  I better end it now.  I am
not pleased.
