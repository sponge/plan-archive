Project:
Unreal Tournament
Plan:
I just finished my 26th hour of Planescape Torment.
I've done little but play this game and eat.
I slept some last night.
This is the best fucking RPG I've ever played.
Man this game rocks.  I have to go to sleep now so that I
can play some more tomorrow.

Oh man this game rocks.  Fucking amazing.
