The demo is in 3dfx's hands.  They'll release it once they and their partners 
are ready to handle the demand.

Server operators should check out the remote admin tool in the demo.  You can
turn it on under "Networking->Web Based Server Administration" in the advanced
options dialog.

When its on and you've set your username and password, surf to
http://YourServersIP/ServerAdmin to log in.

Server Admins should probably run servers with a playerlimit of around
8 to 10.  The deathmatch maps in the demo aren't really large enough to handle big
free for alls.
