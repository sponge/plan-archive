I saw a CTF server running with a 50 playerlimit.  Running servers with more than 32 players is
a no-no because there are hardcoded assumptions about the max playerlimit.  Maybe I'll talk with
Steve about increasing it to 64.  (I guess there isn't really any reason to choose programmer
numbers like 32 and 64 for something like this.)  I seem to recall at one point there being a very
good reason for us keeping it at 32.  Certainly server performance would be...ah...highly questionable
at 64 players :)  Anyway, running with more than 32 in the current demo will probably cause a lot of
odd error messages to get logged when the 33rd person joins.

void IRS_PaymentPlan()
{
	int PaymentStatus = CheckForPayment();
	switch(PaymentStatus)
	{
		case PaymentReceived:
			DemandMoreMoney();
			break;
		default:
			FreezeAllAssests();
			DispatchNinjaAssassins();
			break;
	}
}

Whoever wrote the HUGE weapons mutator deserves a pat on the back.  Its freaking helarious.
JbP has posted a Getting Started modifying the UT demo document on the Mutation Device:

I've been working on my own mod authoring doc.  Its not finished, but maybe I'll stick it online
so people can get started with it.
