We are back from CGDC.

The conference was incredible.  A hell of a lot of fun.  There must
have been something like 10,000 developers there!  I got to meet a
bunch of people I've been wanting to shake hands with for a while and
it was a lot of fun to talk shop with so many different kinds of
developers.

The X-Box keynote by Bill Gates was incredible!  I CAN'T WAIT!  It will
be so easy to design a game with an extremely high level of
interoperability between the PC and X-Box platforms.  You could take a
first person shooter and have the PC guys playing the X-Box guys
over the net on the same servers!  The demonstrations they had were
being done with an NV-15.  The actual power of the X-Box is going to
be something like 30-40% more.  That just kicks ass.

2001 is going to be a really wild year for game developers.  I talked
to a LOT of people at the conference who are PC developers interested
in focusing entirely on the console.  At the same time, we'll have
the X-Box allowing PC developers to bring their software to the console
with very little additional work.

I'll talk more later.
