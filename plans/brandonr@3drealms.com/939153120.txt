I'm working on a rune style system for UT.  Instead of "runes" I'm calling
them Relics.  Anyone working on runes for UT will probably want to hold
up and wait until the Relic system is ready.  It'll allow mod authors
to quickly make new types of Relics that server admins can download
and add to their games.  I'll have a set of guidelines for writing new
Relics.  The Relics may not ship with UT since they'll need a good
bit of testing for balancing.  Relics will be the "official" method of
adding runes to maps and can be added to any gametype (DeathMatch, CTF, etc).

I downloaded the Giants! mutator.  Its helarious.  The mutators people have
been writing are very cool.  I'm going to add a Mutator list section to
the ServerInfo window (F2 inside UT).  I'm also going to add a game speed
indicator (telling you whether the server is Normal, Hardcore, or Turbo).

I've been working on a set of mutators that I will release as a mod
pack for UT later on.  This has given me a chance to add more features
to the Mutator interface.  Mutators can now interact with a player or bots
TakeDamage function and can use server defined console commands.  Jack
added a new kind of SpawnNotification object that gets a notify message
when an Actor is spawned.

What else?  We've been doing various bugfixes.  Specifically Steve has
been working on client side weapon animation issues.  Steve also added
the ability for the translocator to be recalled to your hand.

There has been some concern over stat padding using bots in ngWorldStats. 
Bot activity in ngWorldStats is ignored for the accumulation of individual 
player stats. Here is the word from Craig Sparks (President of NetGames, USA): 

"A individual games "ngStats" will show the bot kills and match up tables, etc. 
But that player's ngWorldStats totals and stats only take into account human vs. 
human interaction. All bot information is ignored for those totals. 
The ELO rating system (which will be documented in the coming days) only takes 
into account wins/losses/frags/etc. against human players."
