There has been some concern over stat padding using bots in ngWorldStats. 
Bot activity in ngWorldStats is ignored for the accumulation of individual 
player stats. Here is the word from Craig Sparks (President of NetGames, USA): 

"A individual games "ngStats" will show the bot kills and match up tables, etc. 
But that player's ngWorldStats totals and stats only take into account human vs. 
human interaction. All bot information is ignored for those totals. 
The ELO rating system (which will be documented in the coming days) only takes 
into account wins/losses/frags/etc. against human players."
