Argh.  I figured out my stupid problem.  You have to talk to the people at the base of the trail like 3 times each and then the woman is gone when you go back up.  That's pretty lame.

So...the Final Fantasy X hintbook must be wrong, because I've got the Cloudy Mirror and I've done what it says to get to the thing that turns it into the Celestial Mirror, but there's some chica blocking my way (say's she's resting) and she won't move.  Unless she moves, I can't get to where you transform the mirror to get the Legendary Weapons.

Anyone know how to get this woman to move out of the way?

I've noticed the hint book was wrong on some other points too.  Like you have to talk to Maester Mika before you can enter the temples after Yunalesca.  I had to go back to get some hidden boxes I missed for the Anima aeon.

I've got all the aeons now, and most of the crests and sigils, I just wanted to get the Legendary weapons before I go to fight Omega Weapon.
