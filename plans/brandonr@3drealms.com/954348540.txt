I lost all of my email.

I need to get email from the following people:

Chris Maudling
Jason Smith from Epoch of Unlight (I think I got your name right?)

I'm really pissed about losing my email.  I assumed that Outlook kept its
mailbox data in the Program Files hierarchy, but it keeps it in the
Windows hierarchy.  So I toasted my drive but kept Program Files which
had my other important data and lost all my email.  What fun.
