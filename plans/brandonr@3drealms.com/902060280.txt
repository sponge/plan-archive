? Unknown

- Toss Encrypt() "rearchitect bad architecture" :)
- Fix Listen/Open and Close

/ Rewrite TcpLink and IpDrv.dll to improve support for
  mod authors
- Rewrite ServerBeacon to greatly reduce broadcast activity
* Rewrite UdpLink, derivatives, and IpDrv.dll to improve support for
  GameSpy and other query programs.

Feedback:
Would appreciate feedback regarding projects the community
is currently working on that would use InternetLink classes.
This will help me determine other features that might be
useful, although ideally the interface will be as simple as
possible.

Goal:
My focus at this point is to rewrite the TcpLink class so that
mod authors have an easy base upon which to construct net aware
modifications (IRC clients, sideways server links?, etc). 

Goal Date:
08/07/98 - Complete above tasks.
