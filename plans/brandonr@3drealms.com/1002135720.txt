I had a weird dream last night.

I was in a Counterstrike game, standing on top of a building with several other counter terrorists.  I had a sniper rifle...we started to move into the building from an access on the roof.  Inside, the building was a huge pit with several pylon things stretched over it.  I noticed that all over the pylons were bananas that you could pick up for health.

I ran across a pylon on the left and was picking up the bananas as I went.  A terrorist was on the other side, but his shots couldn't hurt me because I was eating the bananas so fast.  Eventually he just fell off into the pit for some reason.

Next thing I know, I'm entering a kitchen area.  On the kitchen counter is a box of Teddy Grahams.  So I started to eat those for health also (this is weird, because I haven't had Teddy Grahams for something like 5 years...).  Anyway, as I'm doing that, Kenneth Scott comes into the kitchen and starts throwing powdered shake mix at me.  It got all over the kitchen and I remember running away, leaving the box of Grahams behind.

After that I woke up.  During the dream, I had a clear perception that I was in a game.  Weird stuff.  At least Levelord didn't show up.  Guess I dodged the bullet on that one. :)
