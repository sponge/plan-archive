Project:
Unreal Tournament
Plan:
Saturday, November 27, 1999

I'm working on an updated Linux installer now that will fix
all known installer problems.  Here is a brief synopsis
of each problem and the solution:

Problem: Installer says "This installation doesn't support glibc-2.1"

Solution: Install libxml and libglade.


Problem: UnrealTournament quits with the message "Can't find
file for package WinDrv" or something similar.

Solution: Make Default.ini writable and then untar the file
LinuxGlideSystem.tar.gz in your UnrealTournament directory.
Delete UnrealTournament.ini and then run UnrealTournament.


Both of these are related to sloppy oversights on my part.
Please spread the word about these.  I hope to have the
updated installer out tonight.  The problems above are fixed,
but I want to try and include an optimized light merging
function as well.

The Mesa renderer works under Mesa-Glide.  All that's left to do
is work out some windowing issues with standard Mesa.

DGA mouse input is in and working, but DGA support is broken under
the 3dfx X server.  I'm talking to a few people to find workarounds
for the 3dfx X server DGA problem, if there is any.
