Linux UT will be available for download soon.  Jack will take care of
announcing it and setting up mirrors.  I'm going home, so if there
are any major problems with it email utlinuxbugs@epicgames.com.

Please read the README before you install.

The IRC UT chat went very well.  It was the smoothest IRC chat I've
ever been to and many questions were answered.  Hopefully someone
will post a condensed log.

Thanks to everyone who showed up to support the game and get
involved in the UT community.
