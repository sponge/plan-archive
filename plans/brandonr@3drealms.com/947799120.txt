Cliff wants to call this a "bonus pack" so I changed the text
to reflect that.

We'll soon be releasing an "bonus pack" for Unreal Tournament.
Some of the fan sites have mentioned it and maybe posted a few
screenshots, but nobody has really had many details.  The pack
is a freely downloadable set of additional toys for UT.

Its not a patch and its not a required download, but will have some
cool stuff.  New models, new maps, and our runes system.  Some of
the runes are classics, some are new.

Here is a list of the Relics (runes) and their functions:

Relic of Strength.       
   Doubles your damage.

Relic of Defense.        
   Halfs damage taken. 

Relic of Regeneration.   
   Regain 10 health every 2 seconds.

Relic of Speed.		 
   Increase movement rate by 30%
   Also improves air control.

Relic of Redemption.	 
   If you die while holding this relic, you are teleported away
   from battle with your weapons intact and health restored.
   (Instead of dying)

Relic of Vengeance.
   If you die while holding this relic, a skull floats above your
   body for a brief period of time.  About 1.5 seconds later, the
   skull explodes killing with the force of a Redeemer blast.

This pack will be a free download.  We are still playtesting the
Relics so their rules might change over the next few days.
