A few follow up notes to Keith's comments on Japanese film.

First, in regards to "The Ring," I have to reiterate Keith's point about not watching the DVD menus.  Also, turn off the Korean subtitles.  (If you can somehow manage this without seeing the menus.)  They do have spoilers in the menu, which is strange and annoying.

Now, regarding Asian cinema in general.  Based on our observation, we've determined a few consistant rules regarding the stuff.  One in particular is "sequels always suck."  Now, obviously that isn't 100% true, but it stands in the general case.  Take "A Chinese Torture Chamber Story."  A true masterpiece of asian torture-porn-comedy exploitation cinema.  Some of you may be familiar with the "Fuck Fu" flic that was passed around the internet a few years back.  Well...this is the movie that that little bit came from.  And the whole movie is like that.  This movie features the best scene set to "Unchained Melody" that you'll ever see.  The sequel on the other hand...is terrible.  Utterly terrible.  It isn't funny, there isn't much torture, and what little porn element doesn't feature anything interesting, unless you consider really fat naked chinese men interesting, which I (and my compatriots) do not.  For the most part "A Chinese Torture Chamber Story 2" is Cinemax quality schlock that isn't even worth watching for it's unwatchability.  (If you want something worth watching for unwatchability, I also recommend Wet & Rope, a high example as to why nunsploitation isn't very popular.)

I have a few more recommendations of my own, aside from the previously mentioned "A Chinese Torture Chamber Story."  The first is "For Your Height Only" a terrible Philippino James Bond rip-off featuring a midget secret agent.  I don't think you can get that one at Poker Industries but if you can find it, it's worth it.  The second is "Moon Over Dao" an absolutely rockful Japanese adventure/monster movie featuring a giant calligraphy brush wielding monk.  The third is "Stormriders" an absolutely GREAT fantasy warrior film about a warlord and his sons.  "When a buddah of mud crosses the river, he cannot be assured of his own safety."  The fourth is "The Duel" a sort of prequel to "Stormriders" done by the same team.  Featuring a battle between Sword Saint and the God of Swords.

My buying recommendation for Poker Industries is to just buy whatever seems cool to you.  Definitely try to get the stuff mentioned here (and stuff Keith mentions), but go wild and you probably won't go wrong.  Kung Fu will always treat you right.  In particular, you can never go wrong with movies directed by Yuen wo Ping or movies starring Michelle Yeoh.  We found 90% of our favorites just by watching the previews on DVDs...even for movies that suck.  Also, when in doubt buy Chinese.  Japanese films tend to swing the spectrum, but Chinese is consistantly good.

Other neat ones I don't want to supply links to:

* Comet Butterfly and Sword (funny hat day!)
* The Bride with White Hair (try to understand the plot!)
* Fong Sai Yuk (funny!)
* Mystery of Chess Boxing (Do you recognize my style?)
