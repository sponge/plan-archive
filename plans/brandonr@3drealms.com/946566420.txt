Open source stuff will be out today.  I didn't get a chance
to release it yesterday because I never made it into the office.
Had to wait until 6 for the movers to arrive with my
furniture (they didn't call and say when they were arriving)
and then they closed down the office building to work on a
power main or something.

I watched all 13 episodes of Serial Experiments Lain yesterday.
Best anime I've ever seen.
