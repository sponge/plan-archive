Finished FFX.  60 hours of gameplay.  I highly recommend the game to anyone who likes this kind of game.  It's probably the most beautiful game I've ever played.

I beat the final boss with a single attack, so I think I was a little over powered.  Not nearly as much as Andy Hanson, whose Tidus character finished the entire sphere grid and can do nearly a million points of damage with the Blitz Ace attack.
