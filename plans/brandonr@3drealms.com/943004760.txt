Earlier I said that Linux UT would be available out of the box.  GT
decided that they didn't want to support a Linux version and didn't
want it in the box.  We decided not to argue the issue, so the Linux UT
libraries and executables will not be available in the box.

Instead, I will make them available for download when UT hits shelves.
You'll need to own a copy of UT to use them, obviously.
