So far my Final Fantasy X savegame has 53 hours logged on it, so I think I've officially "played the shit" out of this game.  I only have to dodge lightning 200 times in a row and beat about 500 more games of BlitzBall to get the sigils to unlock the last two secret weapons I need.  Then I can proceed to collect about 100 more monsters 10 times each to unlock the final monster "Subete wo Koeshimono" (He Who Surpassed All).  Of course, to beat the super bosses that lead up to this guy, I might have to raise Yuna's strength to about 120 which will require raising several million Gil in order to bribe Omega Weapon for teleport spheres.

All of that will probably take another 20 to 30 hours of gameplay.  *Head explodes.*

I don't think I'll be doing all of that, but this game has more obsessive side-quests than any game I've seen yet.  It makes doing tailoring in EverQuest look like a...well never mind, nothing could make tailoring in EverQuest look fun.  But it's really really repetitive stuff.

It would be kind of neat, though, if real world soccer matches had status effects.

"Things are not looking good for the Brazilian team.  Their goal keeper is asleep at the post and their center has been turned to stone creating a dangerous mid-field obstruction."

"Bob, I agree with your assessment, but I think the Mexican team is also having problems.  As you can see, their best kicker Juan is suffering from a really nasty degenerative disease that has disabled the use of both of his legs.  It could mean trouble getting the ball downfield."
