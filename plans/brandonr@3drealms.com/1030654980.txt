Tons of games out right now.

I am playing:

Age of Wonders 2.  Beat the first campaign mission.  It was pretty rough.  This game is fun...a lot like Master of Magic.  Still, no game in this genre has yet to top the original.

Icewind Dale 2.  I just loaded it up last night and rolled up a party.  I haven't played yet though.  Probably won't until I clear some other games out of the way.  I'll be playing another evil group.

The Thing.  I started this last night...apparently I'm already halfway done also.  A six hour game?  Yikes.  Pretty fun, although only mildly challenging.  A lot of cool ideas.  Should have been first person :)

Mafia.  I haven't loaded this up yet, but am looking forward to it.

I've also been playing Magic Online.  I was in 2nd place in my Oddessy block league, but played a terrible 4th week and dropped to 8th.  I'm likely to get knocked entirely out of top 16 contention once everyone has played their games.  Very disappointing.

The prize structure in Magic Online is far too top heavy.  You get about 80 boosters for winning a league, but only a couple for coming in 17th place.  Second place earns about 40.  Why the geometric payscale?  I think it would make more sense to award 40 to the 1st place (which is about 120 bucks worth of packs) and spread the rest of the prize out to make an even progression.  Anyone who places in the top 32 of a 256 player league deserves to win something they can brag about.

I promise my next .plan update will talk about game programming.  I just have to think of something I can write about.
