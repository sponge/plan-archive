Project: Getting everything in FF7.
Plan:
I apologize if anyone thought I was really attacking Zarniwoop.
He happens to be a buddy o' mine and I would never mean to
actually burn the guy!

(Actually I'm embarassed as all hell.  Just goes to show that
 sarcasm does not upload well at 56k.)

I'm pondering why .plan files are useful.  Sounds like a good
topic for a PlanetQuake editorial!  Seems like the quickest way
to get yourself in trouble is to type 'vi .plan'
