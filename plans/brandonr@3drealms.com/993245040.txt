OSOpinion.com has run a couple interesting editorials on the lost technologies of Apple.  Of particular interest are the articles on Hypercard...a great little technology that could almost be considered a web precursor.  Hypercard was a system for managing stacks of cards of visual and textual information tied together with a programming language.  When I was younger, before I had my first PC, I only had access to a Macintosh my father would occaisionally bring home from work.  I created little games using Hypercard (and later, another Mac program called World Builder) so I've got fond memories of the technology.  Here are the links to the articles.  Thought somebody out there might be interested in them.
