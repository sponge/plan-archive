-- Make Something Unreal Contest

Skaarj Corps is NOT entered in the contest.  It will NOT be entered
in the contest.  I don't know how the hell this happened, but apparently
someone is trying to enter the mod that Andrew Scheidecker and I wrote
into the contest.  You can't enter other peoples mods!  And I work for
Epic, you can't enter my unfinished mods into the contest anyway.

People are weird!

We've been trying to figure out why someone tried to enter our mod
(which won't ever be released...its on indefinate hold) into the contest.

I have no idea who to get ahold of at the contest to tell them that
Skaarj Corps can't be entered.

I think the thing on the side of the contest page that is making me
and others think someone tried to enter SC into the contest is
just some strange add for Unreal mods anyway.
