Project: Getting everything in FF7.
Plan:
Bill Leeb is godlike.  I've been listening to his work
for about five years now.  I have every Front Line Assembly
CD and nearly every Intermix CD.  I have one CyberActiv CD.
I have a couple Delerium CDs.  I have a ton of Noise Unit CDs.
I have a few FLA videos.  I'm a FLA junkie.

I have never seen FLA in concert.  I love the new FLA sound
but also recognize the skill of Rhys Fulber.

FLA and all Leeb projects are creative masterpieces.  FLA
has consistantly been ahead of digital music by maybe five years
or so.  

I'm just wasting your time with these opinions because I saw
an article about Leeb on Blue's News. 
 
"The track marks are on your spine, they say,
 machines are human they're programmed that way."

Its good to know that other people know who Bill Leeb is.  I don't
know anyone around here who has heard of him. :-(
I also don't know anyone around here who has heard of Steve Ignorant.
I have only met one person who knows who David Thomas was.

Story of Pere Ubu (David Thomas)
http://www.dnai.com/~obo/ubu/ubu_story.html

"The music of a civilization has far-reaching consequences on
 consciousness and, thus, influences the basic nature of a society.
 Music and its rhythms divert and compel the awareness, describing
 the limits within which a consciousness, thus fascinated, may
 operate.  Control the music, then, and you own a powerful tool
 with which to shape the society."
