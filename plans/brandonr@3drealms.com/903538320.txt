Rainbow 6 is incredible.  Absolutely amazing.  

Monday, August 17, 1998

* Sent latest IpDrv and IpServer code to Tim
* Sent new ServerBeacon and ClientBeaconReceiver to Tim
  (Now, instead of pinging the broadcast every 0.5 seconds, ServerBeacon
   broadcasts once when created, then waits for ClientBeaconReceiver
   to say "Hey, there is a new client looking for network games."
   When it hears this, it responds with game information.)

On the CD Rack for today:
Delerium, "Karma"
Laibach, "NATO"
Front Line Assembly, "Plasticity"
Shonen Knife, "Happy Hour"
Collapsed System, "Berlin 2007"
