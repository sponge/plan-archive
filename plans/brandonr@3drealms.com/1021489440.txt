Bah!  The Mage's guild is broken.  It's possible that Trebonius will challenge you to a duel before you reach Master Wizard.  If you accept and in, you get raised one level, but that's it.  After that there is no way to reach Arch Mage.  Also, if you kill him early, there is no way to finish the "Disappearance of the Dwarves" quest.  Blah!

I wrote a little mod that brought Trebonius back for the purposes of raising me to Arch Mage.  I hope this gets fixed though.  Until I thought of the mod, I was pretty angry.  Took me a while to raise my Destruction magic to 90 and then I find out I screwed myself.

As it stands I'm Guildmaster of the Fighter's Guild, Guildmaster of the Mage's Guild, Guildmaster of the Thief's Guild and Grandmaster of House Hlaalu.  I've also done quests for most of the greater Daedra, although I broke one of the quests.  Doh!  Guess I should follow that main story line at some point. :)

Going back to lesser equipment was a good idea.  I had some tough fights last night.
