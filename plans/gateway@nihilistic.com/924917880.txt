Well I put some of my Game Developer Conf video I took
this year of the show online.  I encoded it with Real
Player.. you will need the latest version of G2.

Its just some bits and pieces of the expo floor showing
off some games and hw.

Im looking for mirrors to support the load on the servers
I have right now.  I will keep these up for a day
or so so email me if you want to mirror it on your
site as well.  

I also have a 50 meg mpg of this if like better quality video :)

Found something interesting on the web the other day.
I know a lot of you have been doing the RC5 encryption 
challenge but I found another useful thing for an
idle computer.

Search for ET with your own home computer!

SETI@home is a scientific experiment that will harness
the power of hundreds of thousands of Internet-connected
computers in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence
(SETI). You can participate by running a program that 
downloads and analyzes radio telescope data. There's a small
but captivating possibility that your computer will detect 
the faint murmur of a civilization beyond Earth.
