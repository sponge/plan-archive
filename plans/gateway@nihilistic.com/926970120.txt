5/17

I Just got back from E3.  Was a great show.  I was
really surprised at the response Vampire: The Masquerade
received.  Thanks to everyone who voted V:TM the best RPG
of show from AGN (www.agn.com)

More on e3 soon.  I shot about 2 hrs worth of video of the
show and will release it some time soon.
