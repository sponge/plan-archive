Congratulations to Scott McNutt for winning the level design contest.
He did a excellent job with First Strike map.  Scott wins a Permedia2 board 
With 8 megs of ram.

2. mutated - YooShin Yang
3. abandon - James Parkman aka "gloom"
4. mercy - Brad Kiefer
5. mixspq1- Matt Fox [Mix]

I would like to thank everyone who entered the contest.  It was a tough
Decision and there where a lot of good maps.

A couple of observations I noticed on the maps that where turned in:

On brush entities some times when they arnt fully lit you can use 
This command in the entitites panel when setting it up.
Key: _minlight Value: and use a .3 or .2 u can play with this value.

Monsters are facing the wrong way when you come around a corner.

When you first start a level its always a good idea not to attack the
Player right away.  It's a good thing to let them get there barring first
Then the next place they go into get them.

When making single player maps make sure there are enough 
Weapons/ammo/items to make it though the level.  This is a big
One that we saw on most of the levels.

This is just some advice.. but all in all things looked really good.

Once again Congrats to Scott McNutt.


BTW we are looking for a level designer apply to
