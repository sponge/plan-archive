Wow, haven't updated this since nearly one month... well, not much happened
except that i'm just about to be done with moving all my stuff to my
new appartement in the center of gayland. well, i think i'll just have
to get used to see male people going hand in hand on the street. otherwise,
the appartment is bright, sunny, clean and with an awesome view from the
living room. i'm happy.

also, as i'm moving, my dsl connection is dead so evildildo.com and 
ronography.com won't be accessable until several weeks (why does it
take so long to get dsl in a such cyber city as San Francisco?)

i'm right now working on putting all that windac code into a nice wa3
plugin. for impatient ones, justin will probably integrate windac for
winamp 2.x in some days... i'm thinking about rewritting some code in
wa3 playing core, not that i don't like it the way it is but i hate
to see all this synchronysm code behaving so strangely...

hmm, my head hurts... been moving too much boxes today... me goto sleep

well, i'm off to vegas... before i leave, i corrected/improved some id3v2
stuff in in_mp3. grab the latest one (alpha 16) <a href="http://genghis.winamp.com/~christophe/porn/in_mp3_260_alpha16.zip">here</a>.

changes:
  * [a16] corrected crash/bug in id3v2 genre reading
  * [a16] corrected id3v2 comment editor to support multiple lines :)
  * [a16] new "stop track" button in id3v2 editor so you don't have to retype everything
          when id3v2 can't be updated because file is locked
  * [a16] added track number id3v2 field
  * [a16] id3v2 warnings no more appear under id3 tag editor

oh also, yesterday we went to that Wired Readers Rave party as Justin was
a nominee for the best Rebel or Renegade attitude. too bad he lost :(
anyway, beck was there and a lot of us were drunk. photo report <a href="http://ronography.com/?dir=Parties%2FWired%20Readers%20Rave%20party%20-%20featuring%20Beck%20-%2010-12-00%20-%20SF">here</a>.
ok, i'm gonna grab some prostitutes now.

i've released more free stuff ... this time is the little script that powers
my picture collection page. <a href="http://phpgraphy.sourceforge.net">check it out</a>

also, check out the new in_mp3 decoder <a href="http://evildildo.com/shit/in_mp3_260_alpha15.zip">here</a>. 
it contains a new rad id3 v1/v2 editor and if all goes well, it's gonna be the
new decoder for winamp 2.666. so grab it, test it a LOT and report bugs to
christophe@nullsoft.com and justin@nullsoft.com.

love.

i'm very kind with you today; here's a <a href="http://tofz.org/?display=San%20Francisco%2Ffriends%2F0801-05.jpg">shot</a> featuring myself and Winamp 3 !

I've received my new Nomad Jukebox player yesterday and i can tell you that
this little device owns. There is some downsides but in general, i love it.
Well, here is my little pros/cons review :

pros:
- 6gb hard drive. that's a LOT of space.
- i love the futurist look
- very light
- comes bundled with 2 set of 4 rechargable batteries.
- infrared port present. not used by present.
- eax is kinda nifty. environmental stuff is probably not very worthy, but
  it's cool.
cons:
- you're not able to transfer back files from the device to your machine.
  but you can cheat it by sending zip files renamed to .wav and you have
  a 6gb portable storage device. also, i hope that someone will hack the
  firmware or the (bad) creative software to allow both ways transfers.
- the HD has to spin up at the beginning of every mp3s. why don't they spin
  up the drive when you're at like 75% of the currently playing mp3 ? dumbasses.
- it takes about 25secs to boot.
- parametric EQ could be a lot better. why only 3 bands ?

tomorrow, we're gonna set fire at brennan's house for his birthday. i'm
thinking about inviting some prostitutes there. should be a lotta fun.

PLACEBO - Black Market Music is a very good album. I'd recommend you to buy
it but as it's not out yet, try to get it in some other way :)

Didn't do much today, just implemented id3v2 reading in the new in_mp3.dll for
the upcoming Winamp 2.666 ...

Yay! 2 french female friends just arrived at my home for 2 weeks. Gonna be a
lot of fun.

I was bored on sunday so i played a little with Gecko as we want to use
it into wa3. Note that it will only use Gecko if you have Mozilla installed,
we don't want to add 18 megs to the distribution :)

So here is the result : <a href="http://kmeleon.org">K-Meleon</a>. A tiny, fast web browser using the Gecko engine.

Also, I've been working on the new skin package format and i'm including a
"security" option for you skinners so you'll be able to protect your work.
Let's hope that will stop all the nasty rippers from stealing your graphics.

UPDATE: I'd like to point out that Mr Jonathan Ward just had a haircut. hahaha.
        Please send him some supporting mail to <a href="mailto:jonathan@winamp.com">jonathan@winamp.com</a>.
        He needs it.

I'm right now at the office, with my head burning because of a big sunburn right
on my face. Damn, California sun is evil :/

Steve got a very nice idea that will add a new dimension to the skinning
community. I'll need some time to make it work, but that's definitly worthy.
I know you're tired of just hearing that Winamp 3 will kick ass, but I can
assure you, it really will ... and the release date is pretty soon, so just
have the patience to wait a little more, it will worth it :)

my shoutcast station is now ready <a href="http://www.evildildo.com">here</a>.
it plays lot of stuff that i like, so you can hear about everything there, from
alternative rock to indian music to trance to bossa-nova, everything ...

also, i'm pretty happy with my little PHP script that on-the-fly retrieves
playing infos from the shoutcast XML DNAS page. PHP is so great ...

ok, i got to go back to real work ...

these days, i'll be working on the feature that you all asked for wa3,
which is the winamp 2.x skins support in the new winamp 3 skinning system. yay.

i bought a brand new PRS guitar last week, just received my new Dreamcast
today and my giant 61" Sony TV is coming on friday. joy for me.

on the winamp 3 side, i'm just finishing tweaking the core so the 
plugins developers will soon be able to get a SDK to play with. also, danny is
working a lot on documenting that stuff. joy for you.

-AND-

will Steve STOP writing .plans while making a poop ?
