I was bored on sunday so i played a little with Gecko as we want to use
it into wa3. Note that it will only use Gecko if you have Mozilla installed,
we don't want to add 18 megs to the distribution :)

So here is the result : <a href="http://kmeleon.org">K-Meleon</a>. A tiny, fast web browser using the Gecko engine.

Also, I've been working on the new skin package format and i'm including a
"security" option for you skinners so you'll be able to protect your work.
Let's hope that will stop all the nasty rippers from stealing your graphics.

UPDATE: I'd like to point out that Mr Jonathan Ward just had a haircut. hahaha.
        Please send him some supporting mail to <a href="mailto:jonathan@winamp.com">jonathan@winamp.com</a>.
        He needs it.

I'm right now at the office, with my head burning because of a big sunburn right
on my face. Damn, California sun is evil :/

Steve got a very nice idea that will add a new dimension to the skinning
community. I'll need some time to make it work, but that's definitly worthy.
I know you're tired of just hearing that Winamp 3 will kick ass, but I can
assure you, it really will ... and the release date is pretty soon, so just
have the patience to wait a little more, it will worth it :)

my shoutcast station is now ready <a href="http://www.evildildo.com">here</a>.
it plays lot of stuff that i like, so you can hear about everything there, from
alternative rock to indian music to trance to bossa-nova, everything ...

also, i'm pretty happy with my little PHP script that on-the-fly retrieves
playing infos from the shoutcast XML DNAS page. PHP is so great ...

ok, i got to go back to real work ...

which is the winamp 2.x skins support in the new winamp 3 skinning system. yay.

i bought a brand new PRS guitar last week, just received my new Dreamcast
today and my giant 61" Sony TV is coming on friday. joy for me.

on the winamp 3 side, i'm just finishing tweaking the core so the 
plugins developers will soon be able to get a SDK to play with. also, danny is
working a lot on documenting that stuff. joy for you.

-AND-

will Steve STOP writing .plans while making a poop ?
