Garland Police really suck, you'd think they'd have crimes to prevent or some-
thing.  In my opinion, of course.

One thing i need to clear up, Christian is currently employed by his father's
company, Compuroute Computer Services, Inc., and is not a direct employee of
id Software.  We hire his company, and thus he ends up working under contract
for us.  Just thought i'd let everyone know.

I was just sitting in my office, minding my own business, when something
suddenly struck me, and i though i'd share that with you also.  It's my humble
opion that some of the current immagration laws are really backwards and
screwed up.

Well, i got many requests for the legal notices i mentioned tuesday.  So, if
you wish to do this, we'd appreciate it:

"QUAKE(r) is a registered trademark of Id Software, Inc.  QUAKE(r), the
stylized reproduction of the QUAKE(r) trademark, including, without limitation,
the Q in QUAKE(r),  and the images depicted in QUAKE(r) are the copyrighted
property of Id Software, Inc."

Also, i was reading what i wrote last night, and noticed that my explaination
wasn't really as good as it could be.  In a nutshell, the law would not protect
us if we do not actively attempt to make sure people have permission to use our
trademarked/copyrighted materials.  A lawyer can simply say "see here your
honor, they knew people where not giving them legal credit, yet they did noth-
ing".  By doing that we would be showing a history of 'waiving our rights' to
our logos and other property, and thus we would loose the battle.

Thanks to everyone who wrote and said 'hey, i want to put the legals up'!

Well, as i mentioned previously it's been forever since i updated my .plan.
Just wanted to take a bit of time to comment on a couple of things:

1.  I received several e-mails and phone calls from reporters regarding all
the different changes (primarily personnel leaving), and what effect this has
had on id.  Well, frankly, in today's society, people don't stay at one place
as long as they used to.  Thems is the facts.  So, when people leave, you
just have to find new ones, and hope that they work.  We have an amazing set of
talanted people here at id, and we truly feel that because of this, the next
game we release will be our best to date.  Essentially, what i'm trying to say
is, the team here is as strong as ever, and the atmosphere here is tremendous.

2.  I would like to clarify something about a message that Todd (our CEO) was
sending to the people in charge of all of the Quake/id related Web Sites.
Essentially, we are attempting to get everyone who uses our trademarked/copy-
righted materials, to put a simple legal notice that states that our assets
are the property of id, and that they are used under our permission.  Well,
my PR firm calls me a few weeks ago and says that word is out that id is
'bashing' the web people for using our stuff.  This is simply horseshit.  We
MUST protect our assets and we were just asking nicely if the web masters
would put a small legal notice up, that's all, not extorting money from them
or telling them we were going to sue them or anything like that.  Anyway,
if we don't actively take a position of concern about our things, then when
some company comes along, and truly does outright exploit our stuff (that's a
nice way of saying steal or attempt to screw us ;), then we don't have a legal
leg to stand on.  This is the case because the legal system looks at it as if
we just stood by while letting everyone use our stuff, not doing anything.
The court doesn't particularly care whether it's someone using your property
for goodi or not, only that the owner didn't make an effort to protect it.

So, that's the deal with the legal notice thing, it's just to protect us from
being hosed in the future, not to get shitty with the web sites, we _totally_
apprectiate the attention that so many people give our products.

3.  Christian, Xian, Disruptor, damn glad he's here.  I was at the brink of
drowning, and we are psyched to have him on board, he is a great asset, very
talented.  Also should mention that we have a new level designer named Paul
Jaquays (pronounced Paul, oh shit, that's the easy name, pronounced
'jake-ways').  He's another 'older fella', at 40 (i think he said he was 40).
Anyway, i guess that just means more seasoned gamers on the team, and he's
been around the gaming industry for many years.  We're glad to get both of
them!

Well, it's been nearly a year since i edited my .plan file, so i thought
it was about time to do so.

I started here, as most of you know, as the person in charge of our customer
support.  But, things change, the world is dynamic.

Recently we've had many changes, people leaving, etc.  I received many inquires
as to my opinion on how all of these 'departures' have affected id as a company.
