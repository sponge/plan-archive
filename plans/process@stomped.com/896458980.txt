Processed News Opens for Business
---------------------------------

http://www.processed.net - Go there now!

Yep, this is the site I mentioned way back when, finally
out on my own with a solo gaming news site. By pure
coincidence, I ended up opening just as the 3.15 patch
for Quake 2 came out, so I've got it mirrored there.

As the church lady might say, "How convenient".
