Thanks to all that dropped by the Rune demonstration at ECTS.  Also a big thanks
to Brandon and Jack from Epic and all the guys at The Playing Fields for use of
their ISDN to get some last minute file transfers.  They've got a great setup there
with the perfect balance of alcohol consumption and network bandwidth.  We must
get a place like that closer to home.  London rocks.

Has anyone tested Visual Source Safe for Y2K?  That's the only tool in
our arsenal that I think could be susceptible.

I'm also looking for a good consumer/commercial GL card with the
following qualities:
	- Stable drivers 
	- Runs Softimage
	- Supports multiple viewports without slowdown
	- Runs fast in a window or fullscreen
