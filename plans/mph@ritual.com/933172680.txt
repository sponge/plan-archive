28 July 99

Saw a sneak preview of MYSTERY MEN last night.
It was freakin' hilarious!! It's kinda ironic because
it reminds me a lot of the WATCHMEN story that I spoke 
of the other day. Except these super heros are all idiots! 
It's like someone got REALLY HIGH reading the Watchmen 
and decided to make a comedy out of it. It's a hoot! 
It was cool to see Pee-Wee Herman (Paul Reubens) back in 
action as The Spleen. And Ben Stiller does a fine job as 
Mr. Furious. Go check it out at: http://www.mysterymen.com/

I'm still trying to figure out what *MY* super powers are.
How about... I can braid long blades of grass into bunny
rabbit shapes to distract the enemy. Or I can throw movie 
popcorn with pinpoint accuracy. Or I can break both my arms 
and legs then spin about like a human weedwhacker to beat the 
enemy senseless. Or maybe I should get back to work now... ;)

What is YOUR super power??
