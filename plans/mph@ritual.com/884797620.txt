Been really busy adding logs to the SiN fire lately. 
Forgive me, but I haven't had a lot of time to respond 
to some of your emails or do any interviews, but I paused 
for a moment for my pals Alex and Billy over at Voodoo Extreme. 
For any of you out there that aren't familiar with the 
ins and outs of SiN, check out http://www.voodooextreme.com 
for a quick interview I did. They did a fine job as always!

We decided on paint colors for our new offices yesterday. Very cool!
I can't wait to move into the new office space. I feel like
we're living in a college dorm right now. Packed in like
sardines. 

Oh yeah, planning on hiring some artists in the near future to
work with our new badass technology
