Putting the last polish on the SiN demo.
She's looking good boys, real good! ;)

Sorda feel like the Orkin Man chasing down all the last
minute bugs that always hop in right before a code release.
I've played the demo so many times my eyes are bleeding. 
It will be nice to finally get some fresh opinions from
the community.

Oh well, just wanted to give an update and let you know
this baby's gonna sizzle. 
Gotta jump back into our SinCity Deathmatch server and kick 
some ass. It's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it! =)
