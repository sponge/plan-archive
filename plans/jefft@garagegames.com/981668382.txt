I just got off the phone with Bill Linn from Linn Public Relations.  We talked about a lot of things, but the most intersting is that Bill offered to post information on our PR Forum.

In case you don't know, public relations people work to get your game, company, or self reviewed or written about in magazines and other forms of media.  For independent developers, PR is probably the only form of marketing that you or your product will get.  It is a very effective means of getting people to find out about your product.

Bill Linn is the best PR person in the games business.  We have worked together in the past when Bill was employed by Sierra, then again after Linn PR was formed and Bill did the PR campaign for Tribes and Starsiege.  His current clients include Sony, Ravensberger, Crave, and other highly recognized names in the games business.

Please take advantage of this great opportunity to ask Bill questions.
