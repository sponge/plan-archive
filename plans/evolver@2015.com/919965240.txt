Wages of Sin is now in stores! We poured a great deal of ourselves into
this project, and we think you're going to like what you see. Making
this pack was a fantastic experience. The design team here is such an
incredibly talented group. Now that we won't be under the constraints of
an add-on pack, expect our next offering to be something really special!

I want to say how grateful we all are to Ritual Entertainment for giving
us the chance and the means to do this thing. The guys at Ritual are some
of the most talented in the industry, and to build upon their work is to
stand on the shoulders of giants.

Oh, I see there's a gameplay prototype testing session in progress...
Looks like it's back to the grind. :)
