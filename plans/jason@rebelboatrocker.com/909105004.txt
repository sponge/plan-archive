 Today I was looking through a 1985 'Transworld Skating' magazine which
 Randy brought in a couple days ago. (He found it while moving)
 It had Mark "Gator" Rogowski prominently displayed on the first page.
 Is he still in prison for murder?

 Flipping through the magazine I noticed that most of the boards had rails,
 nose guards,and truck guards on them. They also had fat, huge wheels, and
 not one of the boards pictured was symmetrical.
 Man skateboards use to suck. At least I didn't see any Simms long boards.
