Been awhile since I've updated, but I found some update-worthy content
last night while searching through various Quake related newsgroups.

 From one posting:

Paradox would kick Thresh's ass in the following categories:
1. stylish spinning rocketjumping
2. Stupidest way of killing time when waiting for weapons to respawn
(continuously looking down and jumping back and forth, giving away his
position.)
3. Killing himself with the RL.
4. Demo entertainment value!

heh..Ok, I had a problem there doing the old #2 and #3 for a while, but
I'm over that now.  doh!

 From another posting:

ahahah, oh man, you have seen too many of Paradox's demos, but that
is right on the money.  He is very entertaining to watch, but he
kills himself too often by either doing something stupid and dying
for it, or missing one of his cool rocket jump spin around blast
someone in the head while looking upside tricks. ;)

I hate to correct this, but its "Cool rocket jump, BLAST then spin around
slapping somebody in the head while looking upside down tricks."

Just a slight correction :)

 From Yet another amusing posting:

I saw the same map played with a demo called paracree.dem which included 
KC and a psuedo-boyfriend guy that has a nick that starts with "Para", 
and that Para guy could have taken that Ferrari from Thresh given the chance.

 Ok, change "psudeo-boyfriend guy" to "definite, badass, BSPp1mp boyfriend guy"
and its right.

But I tend to agree with the Ferrari thing  >=o
				(this simley face crap will soon end)
 
 And another posting:

ahahahahahahaa... that's exactly what I was thinking!  The main reason
ParadoX is entertaining "on tape" is that his playing style is overly
aggressive and just generally slightly insane...

Wh00p.  INSANE YOU SAY?!  heh..

Well it looks as if my demo entertainment value is worthy of public
opinion; glad I could be here for ya ;)  

Thanks for all the cool demo/playing style comments - lemmie know if you 
want me to do more demos, or your tired of seeing the 1-4 above.  heh..
