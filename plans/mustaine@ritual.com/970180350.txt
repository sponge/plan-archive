[. FAKK2 Arena - A call for maps .]

We are hard at work putting together FAKK2 Arena for public consumption, but we
can always use more maps!  Sooo....

Anybody interested in getting their maps put into the official release of
FAKK2 Arena, please send me your maps.  For specifications on what you need
to create a map for FAKK2 Arena, check out http://www.ritual.com/FAKK2/arena.html.

Please limit the number of arenas in a single map to 4 unique arenas.  On 
average, most arenas should have 3-4 battle areas, each with a different weaponry
choices and themes.

Also, please use textures we shipped with the game. 

Once finished, All I will need is the .map/.scr and other relevant files, we will compile
the maps here.  

Any questions, email me.
