-Two years.  Excellent ;)

-Next up, doublebind in the Sin demo!
 I'm pretty sure most people don't know about this, but we implemented
 the coolness of double-click binding in Sin.  You can doublebind any
 key, or mouse button to any command.  Quite useful for those who
 want to save on reaching, or just want to put lots of cool stuff on
 one key!

 Heres a few common doublebinds I use:

 doublebind mouse2 +use
 doublebind mouse3 +moveup

 Other doublebind related commands

 undoublebind      - undoublebind the doublebound keys
 doublebindlist    - list doublebound keys
 K_doubleclicktime - max time in milliseconds max for double
                     click to register. (250 default)

 Have fun!

-Heya, for those of you who haven't checked out the new ACTION PACKED (heh heh)
 SiN avi head on over to 
 <a href="http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/0,3,1940,00.html">http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/0,3,1940,00.html</a>
 and check it out.  

 The AVI was recorded in the Sewer level displayed at E3 and shows 
 off some of the complex interaction and destruction that goes on in SiN.
 Plus, the middle sequence gives a little insight into our creature duck,
 cover, fallback, and hiding AI.  That dude is REALLY into self 
 preservation!  Also, if you notice, as I shot at the baddie, 
 when you hit him in the leg, he reacts to being shot in the leg and
 that portion of his body becomes damaged!  Ahhhhh, the joys of SiN.

 There is also a little peek at our 3rd person view in the AVI,
 you can see the weapon attached to Blade, and the damaged parts of
 his body revealed as he gets shot.  Neato stuff!

-I read Jason Zelsnack's .plan about the ol'Ridge Racer machine at the 
 Citadel in Colorado Springs.  OH YEAH, THATS RIGHT!  I would take time out
 of my lunch hour to head on down to the arcade and get a little
 Ridge Racer action goin!  I think if he and I were to find a machine
 down here, we could settle this once and for all!  Ridge Racer SHOWDOWN!
 Definitely a small game-world we live in...

 Although, despite Jason and I constantly knocking the top
 lap time around, my friend Josh Martel ended up getting the lap time
 that smacked both Jason and I down.  Heck, last time I 
 remember being in Colorado Springs, Josh's lap time was STILL
 on there.  Doh!

 NOW, DON'T MAKE ME COME OVER THERE AND BUST SOME VIRTUACOP CAP'S IN YO ARSHES!

-Zor likes cheese

-Badass Ritual party last weekend!  Level'ord, Zor, KillCreeky and I smacked 
 down the pool volleyball competition.  Our pale skins, computer related jokes,
 and otherwise lack of control in water provided the necessary tools to distribute
 beatings!

-Stevie has been busy busy recently with levels galore and book writing extreme!

-I must take this time to say hello to my parents, who I know are reading this ;)
 My Mom is now hooked on Diablo (!) and my Dad is still cracking demon skulls 
 in Doom, smacking down Quake/Quake2, nuking aliens in Duke, and preparing 
 to SiN!  Man I love this stuff!

-Also, never got a chance to say Congratulations to Berenger and Megan for tying
 the knot.  The trip to Chicago was definitely a trip to remember.

-I've been playing a lot of the Die Hard Trilogy on playstation, totally rocks.
 Also, Time Crisis on playstation (finally found it Bra, heh) is awesome, comes
 with a entire new mission that fits somewhere between Time Crisis and Time
 Crisis 2.
