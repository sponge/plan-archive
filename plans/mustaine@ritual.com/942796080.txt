 [. Rush 2049/Midtown Madness and Silent Scope .]

I have to say, Rush 2049 is the best arcade driving game I have ever
played.  Since Hard Drivin, only a few driving games came close to 
being the top driving dog, games like the arcade Ridge Racer, and the
original Rush.  Now, Rush 2049 just took the trophy in my eyes.  Every
track is FILLED with secret shortcuts, so many I find myself paying more
attention to the detail on the side tracks than the actual race.  Plus,
the player registration feature should be incredibly cool when they start
taking that info from the actual arcade machine and slapping in on 
the Rush 2049 website.

Midtown Madness still gets my top PC driving game :]  Especially when 
you play it with a Logitech Wingman Formula Force Wheel.  I played Midtown
Madness most of the way though with the mouse, then we got our hands on
some Formula wheels and I had to start over it was so cool.

Also, played Silent Scope, Wow!  Finally, a step up from Time Crisis.
Plus, after talking to some of the other Ritual guys, we started to wonder
if Silent Scope could have one of those secret Last Starfighter chips in it.  
If you do good enough, some guy shows up at your door offering you a new 
and interesting career in "professional elimination."   That or an offer to
be recruited by the Star League to defend the frontier from Xur and the 
Ko-Dan Armada.  (Anybody that doesn't remember The Last Starfighter, goto
IMDB's Last Starfighter page.)

Pat Hook was recently recruited to the Star League for his high scores 
in Heavy Barrel.

 [. Quake3 .]

With all the cool Everquest items for sale on Ebay, I wondered if I could
sell a Railgun with 50 slugs for a few hundred...hmmm  Might be a bit tough
since there is no "drop weapon" in Q3.  Doh!

 [. System Shock 2 .]

Ok, I was a real skeptic at first.  Being a huge fan of the original
System Shock, and considering SS1 was the ONLY game that pulled me 
away from DooM for any extended amount of time, I didn't think that 
a new System Shock title could even come close to the level of the 
original.  All the great things about the original, the in depth 
interface, the shocking events, the creatures that scare the piss out 
of you, the storyline backed up with tons of foreshadowing via logs 
and emails, its amazingly all there in this great sequel.  SS2 is an 
incredible game, and just like the original, it has temporarily pulled 
me away from my previous vices (Quake3, RollerCoaster Tycoon, Midtown 
Madness and Worms Armageddon.) The implementation of RPG elements has
also got my wheels turning, I expect to play through this game a few 
times going different directions with my character.  I definitely 
recommend this game to those who are not only bigtime shooter fans 
looking for a little more, but the lite-RPG player who prefers Zelda64
to Baulders-Gate :]

Now for some good old C64 trivia fun.  I've been trying to remember the 
name of an oldschool C64 demo that featured a circular dotscroller on the
final page of the demo.  I know there has to be a few C64'ers out there
that might know the name of this demo.  Anybody?  And nope, its not 
anything recent, it was one of the first demos of its kind.

 [. OldSch00l-lite .]

Hooked up the Amiga recently up at the office. :]  Oh how I miss great 
games that fit on one 720k floppy.  Also, why hasn't anybody done an
internet version of New World Computing's Nuclear War?  Man, that would
rock!

Ok, Back to FAKK!
