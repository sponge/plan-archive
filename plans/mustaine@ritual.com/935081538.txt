 [. System Shock 2 .]

Ok, I was a real skeptic at first.  Being a huge fan of the original
System Shock, and considering SS1 was the ONLY game that pulled me 
away from DooM for any extended amount of time, I didn't think that 
a new System Shock title could even come close to the level of the 
original.  All the great things about the original, the in depth 
interface, the shocking events, the creatures that scare the piss out 
of you, the storyline backed up with tons of foreshadowing via logs 
and emails, its amazingly all there in this great sequel.  SS2 is an 
incredible game, and just like the original, it has temporarily pulled 
me away from my previous vices (Quake3, RollerCoaster Tycoon, Midtown 
Madness and Worms Armageddon.) The implementation of RPG elements has
also got my wheels turning, I expect to play through this game a few 
times going different directions with my character.  I definitely 
recommend this game to those who are not only bigtime shooter fans 
looking for a little more, but the lite-RPG player who prefers Zelda64
to Baulders-Gate :]

Now for some good old C64 trivia fun.  I've been trying to remember the 
name of an oldschool C64 demo that featured a circular dotscroller on the
final page of the demo.  I know there has to be a few C64'ers out there
that might know the name of this demo.  Anybody?  And nope, its not 
anything recent, it was one of the first demos of its kind.

Hooked up the Amiga recently up at the office. :]  Oh how I miss great 
games that fit on one 720k floppy.  Also, why hasn't anybody done an
internet version of New World Computing's Nuclear War?  Man, that would
rock!

Ok, Back to FAKK!
