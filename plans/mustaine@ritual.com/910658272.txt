 [. Sin Patch .]

We will be releasing a patch in the next few days that will
address some of the bugs that have filtered their way down.

Here are the major bugs that we addressed:

- Long load times, Fixed.
- Broken mutant woes.  Fixed.
- Major soundcard issues.  Fixed.
- Levels loading twice, causing major gameplay issues.  Fixed.

Sorry for any inconvenience this has caused,  if we had known about any
of these bugs we would have fixed them right away.  We also took the time
to iron out the other bugs that cropped up and are in the process of 
testing everything now.  

Also, all future retail copies of Sin will have these bugs fixed.
