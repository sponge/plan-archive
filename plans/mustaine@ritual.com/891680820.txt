Been awhile, eh?
Forgive the potentially dated content here, I am just spewing anything
recent or somewhat recent that comes to mind....b0rk...



Ahhh....Being here right now is sooo cool, 4:30am on a Friday night, no
Lost in Space for me! ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES TOM A DULL BOY!! Muahahah!

I see that everybody seemed to like my embarrassing moment up on Dear Mynx.
(seemed being the important word here..) Not anything I am totally proud of,
but hey, that's just the beginning of strange goings on when I was a kid.

Sin is looking so perfect right now, DM is incredibly fun, the single 
player levels are reaching completion, and everything is working like 
a charm.  Its awesome to see this thing molding itself into the 
vision we have all been striving for the past year.

Stevie and I dropped by Ion Storm for a while last night.  Wow, my Doomin
is outta practice.  Romero took me down 3 times, I just can't stand for that
kind of beatdown.  Gonna have to break out the old boomstick and clean out the
barrel.  Time to hose down some RBR and Ion Storm Doom ego's.  Stevie
kicked lots more butt than I did last night, her Quake skills transferred over to 
Doom without any hitches.  Hey, Aim is aim is aim, is aim.  I think Q2 DM is 
making me soft, something about 20 people running around with BFG's that tend
to take off the competitive edge....oh well, back to Sin DM and DooM.

Speaking of Doom, legacy doom kicks ass.  Lookup, lookdown, 8 player, the 
whole nine yards of coolness.  

Speaking of Q2 DM.  Man, sewers64 totally rocked my world.  

Anybody remember an old game for the C64 named Cliff Hanger?  Now there's a
game to remake!

Oh yeah, If anybody hasn't seen Titanic yet, go and see it.  The movie totally rocks, 
despite the tearjerking ending.  Its a visual technology marvel, the soundtrack rocks,
the real storys behind the tragedy are incredible, and it just proves (to me at least)
that Cameron is still the master.  Anything that can pull in a Billion bucks worldwide
has to be a winner.  And, if Titanic isn't your thing, The Big Lebowski kicks ass too!

Well, its about 4:50am now, I should be seeing levelord dropping in just about 
anytime.  Guy is freaking me out, getting up at 3:00am and heading on in?!  
Sick sick sick.



Oh yeah, here's something interesting for ya.  I've been trying to write up a GIANT
list of my all time favorite games...here's a few from that list.  Drop me a line
if you remember any of these mofo's.

Some old C64 stuff:
Raid on Bungling Bay (I think that's how it was spelled...?)
Stunt Car Racer
Who Dares Wins Who II
International Karate I/II
Cliff Hanger
MULE
Legacy of the Ancients 
Racing Destruction Set
Delta
Boulder Dash
Skate or Die

LOTS more to come...My homage to the old sierra games will make it in here eventually.

I'm off to fold some space, paradoxically of course...
