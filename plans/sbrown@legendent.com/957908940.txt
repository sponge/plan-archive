It's been a while, I know...but things continue to get more
complicated and the work continues to pile up and the
world continues to spin, and the sand continues to fall
through the hour glass and so are the days of our lives...

Ugh.

I had a number of things on my mind to talk about this
time around, but because I wasn't really planning on doing
my .plan right now I hadn't studied ahead of time (damned
pop quizzes).

One topic I wanted to discuss is the changes to the WoT
home page and the new message board. First off, thanks for
all the compliments on the new page design, honestly it isn't
really our doing as GT has been reworking the site to mesh
with their advertising schemes, but it is nice to see the site
overhauled...even if it takes time to get it all looking and
sounding right (it's tough to get them to understand the
difference between fact and industry buzz words). As for
the message board, I understand this is a point of both
praise and frustration. The outages on the board have been
bothering me a great deal, as they have an annoying tendency
to turn people away from the site (and it also looks pretty
unprofessional). I know I've said a few dozen times already,
but I still think the host provider is at fault. The message board
really is pretty stable and even the author can't figure out how
the errors could be occurring (the database is designed
to prevent these types of errors). So to all of you suggesting
one message board or another, it really wouldn't help.
WWWBoard had errors, WWWThreads gets errors, my guess
is any other board would get errors as well. Besides that, the page
has gone off-line once or twice for a few mins, so I really think it's
a problem with the server.

Another nugget I thought you all might be interested in, I got a
chance to walk through every one of the levels last night (ah, the
life of a tester) some of them for the first time. I have to admit,
there were a number of times when my jaw just hit the ground.
There is so much attention to detail and just flat out beauty in these
levels. It's also amazing how well Jordan's familiar environments
have been recreated...and that's all the detail I'm giving :]

Finally, I've got a treat for everyone. I figured I would post the
accumulated nonsense from the white board in my office. Let
me first make it clear that very little of what you see up there is mine.



This next picture is a simulation of what it might look like to walk
through the Legend hallways after several days of no sleep and a
bad caffeine hangover.



What you see below is our angreal mastermind (uber brainiac?),
Aaron, working his magic in the early morning hours. A little known
fact about Aaron, his super powers actually originate from the
popular soft drink known affectionately as the "Nectar of Speed" and
commonly referred to as Mountain Dew (TM).



Finally, I'm posting a picture of YT (yours truly for all you
non-Stephenson fans). This is me huddled behind my wall of 
computers on the brink of churning out more mind numbing drivel 
such as the text you are reading right now.

*noting Aaron's .plan*

I see how it is! Just trying to get your .plan noticed
eh! Well, I'll show you!

Oh, and I do have some extensive updates planned for this
here...er, .plan. I just have to find the time, perhaps
when I get home tonight.

mmmm....crunchy milk...

A phrase I was considering last night while slurping down
a glass of partially frozen milk (the refrigerator was set
too cold, it would seem) and chatting with my roommate
about the various goings ons in our respective offices.
Dave was telling me about his office party and all the
rediculous hours he and his co-workers work. I was talking
about the things we've been doing on WoT, about our
upcoming move to new offices (woohoo!) and, naturally,
all the wacky hours the guys here at Legend put in.

And so I got to thinking about what it really means to work at
Legend. There are numerous wonderful things about working
here. First (and foremost on all of your minds) is the chance
to work on the amazing game, Wheel of Time and the opportunity
to work on future games, like Unreal 2. It's also great being
a part of such a dynamic industry, one that is constantly
changing, evolving and revolutionizing the way we recreate.
Finally, there's the people. . . Of course, there are some
great people in the gaming industry, but I'm speaking more
specifically of those I know personally, those people who
reside squarely in the middle of LegendLand. More than the
games create, we are defined by those who make up this unique little
land, and a wonderful land it is. So, as my little Hallmark to
all the citizens of LegendLand...

Happy Holidays to:

Bob
Mike V.
Rosie
Glen
Mike F.
Dave
Jim
Aaron
Jess
Mark
Duane
Scott
James
Warren
Marc
Matthias
Andy
Eric
Steve B
Steve S
Justin
Paul
Julie
Robert
And any other artists I haven't met :]

And to each of your families...

Also, happy holidays to all of you who are faithful followers
of WoT and to you less faithful, well, get more faithful...just
look at all the perks! (Meaning, you get to be included with the
afformentioned "faithful follower" title.)

That's about it for my greetings card. I hope everyone has a safe
and happy holiday and a wonderful New Year.

I realize it's been a month since my last update, but
there really isn't much for me to report on that anyone
would find interesting. I could tell you that I got in
a batch of really nice footstep sounds, but that isn't
nearly as exciting as news from the level designers about
cool levels or Aaron's awesome new angreal code. hmmm...
I can't resist...I've got some great footstep and ambient sounds.

Alright, so now that I've gotten past all the exciting stuff,
I'll talk about my boring life a bit. Saturday night Jess Crable,
my roommate Dave and I went out to a lounge to watch Eric
Heberling (who produces sound effects for WoT) perform in his
band "Flyer". It was actually quite cool. They are basically
a coverband, but I was imperessed by their versitility playing
everything from Rod Stewert to Tone Loc, including pieces from
Dishwalla, Alanis Morissette and Sheryl Crow mixed in. Now, that
was all great, but upstaging the wonderful show was this man on
the dance floor, who was, only in the loosest sense of the
definition, dancing. This guy was wearing a Harley Davidson
T-shirt that was long past its youth (not that I have anything
against Harley Davidson, mind you, I am merely reporting what I
saw). Every milimeter of his face was sprouting hair, I honestly
had trouble differntiating the front of his head from the
back....and his movements on the floor were like, well, they
were like a full body dry heave set to music. Watching this
guy was like watching one of those FOX freak-fests such as
"When Lawn-Care Machinery Attacks!" It was nearly impossible
to draw my attention away from this man's seizure-like prancing
about the dance floor. Every few seconds Jess and I would turn
to each other with puzzled looks on our faces and ask what the
hell this guy was doing. Actually, I suppose there wasn't much
question, he was having a good time, nothing wrong with that,
he just had a unique way of displaying his enjoyment...or, something.

So that's my bit of bizarre news...now for the more close to home
stuff. A little while ago, ten of us here at Legend, went out to see
Star Trek: Insurrection. Nice flick, it was fun, but certainly not great.
Regardless of the movie, I had a great time with the group, and it's
also great to see them out of their natural habitat (the office). And
while we're on the topics of dancing and unnatural habitats, Scott
worked up an interesting little "technology demo" that demonstrates
Unreal's various light effects and some cool character animations...it
really has to be seen and heard to be believed so I won't go into detail
explaining it here.

Well, that's it for this report. I've got some other stuff stewing
in my brain right now concerning some other personal life related
matters, but for now, I'll just hold off. Until next time, stay well.
