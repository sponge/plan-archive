Three updates in as many days...gotta
get control of myself...

Hey Action Quake guys...a few of us here
are seriously addicted to playing action
quake now...so, um, like release that new
version soon and stuff.  Looks damn cool.

WOW!  Just last week I was scavanging for
a gamepad around the office...I just can't
play any kind of racing sim on the PC
without one.  Well, guess what shows up today
in abundance?  Logitech sent us a whole bunch
of crescent fresh Thunderpads!  Very freaky
considering I never even said one word about
needing one.  Except to Billy.  Hmmmm.

So thanks a bunch for those mister Logitech
dudes.  And thank you John Harris over at EA
for getting our precious little E3 cream shot
posters sent to us.  The new pride of the office.

Damn...I'm sitting here in my office looking out
the window and watching Dallas (and the Ion Storm
building) being painted with one hell of a lightning
storm.  I bet it's still 103 out there though.

Oh yeah...quite unrelated here...but is anyone out
there running a '91 or later MR2 Turbo in SCCA SOLO2
events?
