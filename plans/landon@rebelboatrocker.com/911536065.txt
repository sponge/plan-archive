All I can say is buh-aha-aha-aha-ahaaaa

You know you have something pretty special when
not just one or two kids in the office buy
a particular title (Half-Life) but rather,
only two or so don't.  And when every
damn EB in town is sold out by 2:00pm.
And I guess you know you have someting pretty
special when it just f'ing is!  Way to go Valve!
