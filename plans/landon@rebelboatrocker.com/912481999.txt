Damn.  December.  75 degrees.

GOD damn.

Anyhoo, just noticed on Voodoo that Septerra Core is going
to be published by none other than Monolith!  WOO!  I'm
so glad to see that Valkyrie's title is not only going to be
published but is in good hands to boot.

The Thief demo is really cool...just the kind of stuff I
like.  I dig the water arrows!  What a tasty couple of
titles in a row...Trespasser (which I completed and loved...
one of the few I guess), Half-Life (playing it again asap
in difficult) and now Thief.  And System Shock 2 isn't too
far away...mmm mmm mmmm.

Oh yeah...nobody go buying the Audi TT next Spring or
the European spec TT the following Summer.  I don't want
to see too many of em other than mine.  Okay?  Kerry? :)

All I can say is buh-aha-aha-aha-ahaaaa

You know you have something pretty special when
not just one or two kids in the office buy
a particular title (Half-Life) but rather,
only two or so don't.  And when every
damn EB in town is sold out by 2:00pm.
And I guess you know you have someting pretty
special when it just f'ing is!  Way to go Valve!
