Hmmm...Looks like someone found themselves a pot of fool's gold.  I just want
everyone to know a few things about the screenshots that recently got 
"released".  All the content in the shots is actual Prax War content
(i.e. map geometry, models, textures) that appears as it would in
the actual game.  However, the arctic scenes were not rendered in the game
engine, but were 3DS Max renders that I had done for my own personal portfolio,
which was sitting on our local linux box.  I gave Jobe (boatrocker.com) the OK
to post them once they got out since I didn't feel it would do any harm, but I
do apologize for any confusion that has resulted.
