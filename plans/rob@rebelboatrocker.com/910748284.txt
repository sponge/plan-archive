DooM Stuff:

I'd just like to say thanks to everyone involved in the Frag2
DooM][ Allstar Deathmatch tournament.  I had a great time and
hopefully we can do this kind of thing more often, now that 
everyone's been given a reminder that DooM][ is the best 
deathmatch game ever made.

Game Stuff:

Ok, no, I'm not going to divulge any mind-blowing info on our
game, but I will say that we've got some really cool stuff coming
together.  Reichert's jungle map is looking especially cool with
the help of Stephen Bahl's patented "jungle tree voodoo magic".
I recently broke down and gave in to the evil powers of 3DS Max,
and I'm actually glad I did.  All hail splines and the mighty
Loft tool!  Now if someone could just get their interface together
(i.e. make viewport camera movement something other than sluggish 
and unbearable) I might actually use it even more.

Other Stuff:

If anyone is into Soul Coughing, I highly recommend their newest
album, 'El Oso'.  Some really good stuff on there.  Does anyone
know if/when the Rentals' next album is due out?  I thought I
read somewhere that it was coming out in January or February, but
I could be wrong.  Also, what's the word on Weezer (minus Matt Sharp)?  
Do they have anything in the works?  And if anyone can recommend any
other bands along the lines of Weezer/The Rentals/That Dog, please send
them my way.  I'd be very, very grateful.  Too many hours at work, and
not nearly enough CD's...
