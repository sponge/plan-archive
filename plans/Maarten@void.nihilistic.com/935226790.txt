This announcement has been a long time in the making.
Yujin Kiem joined Nihilistic software on September 15.  Yujin and I worked together 
at Cyclone on Requiem "Wrath of the Fallen" (I refuse to call it that new lame ass name).   
At Cyclone Yujin created every environment texture in the game.  When you check out the sneak peak of 
Requiem, you will get a glimpse of his amazing texture skills.  Since joining the team he has made 
tremendous contributions establishing the look and feel of the "World of Darkness" (The dark 
setting of the Masquerade Vampire License).  I am very excited Yujin joined the team, and I can't wait 
for everybody to see results of his hard work when the first screenshots are released.
