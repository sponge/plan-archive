I am delighted to announce Nihilistic software’s has added another member to the Art team.
The talented Sara Szundi joined us in our new office last week.  

Sara is a graduate from San Jose State University where she received a degree in Graphic
Design/Illustration.  She brings much valuable experience with her having worked as a 
contract artist at SSI, and created many of the skins and world textures for Cyclone Studio’s 
Requiem.  Over the past couple of years Sara worked on Crusaders of Might and Magic for 
the PC and Playstation and recently just finished her duties on the upcoming Warriors of 
Might and Magic for the Playstation 2.  

We all look forward to seeing her apply her talents and bringing her own special touch to 
the worlds we create.

Welcome Sara!
