After a long hard search I am happy to announce Nihilistic Software has found a talented new artist/animator to join our ranks.  
This week Jason Felix joined Nihilistic Software and we are all very excited with the talent and skills he brings to the team.  
Jason is a self-taught artist who started his career as a Freelance artist doing illustrations for White Wolf Games, FASA, TSR, 
and Wizards of the Coast.  He has since worked at Mattel on Prince of Persia and Panzer General.  Upon leaving Mattel, he
joined Savage Frog!, where he worked on a number of TV shows as a Lead Animator, 3D modeler, Technical Director, Texture Painter,
Illustrator.  Needless to say Jason can do it all and is going to make a huge impact on our next game.

For those of you who would like to see a sample of his work, be sure to check out his animation on the SavageFrog! Website. 

Just go to http://www.savagefrog.com/pro_frame_02.htm - click on animation and select the Robbie animation.  It's guaranteed to
make you laugh.

So a big welcome to Jason Felix!
