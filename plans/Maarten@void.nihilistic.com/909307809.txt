At last our artist search has been completed.  I am psyched to announce Rick Servande
has joined Nihilistic Software. 

Rick comes from a traditional background.  He graduated from the illustrion program 
at San Jose Sate, and has since worked for two animation houses;  Six Foot two productions
and Thrillionare productions.  His great traditional skills made him the ideal candidate to 
help develop our character designs, paint textures, and create the highest quality animations.

Welcome Rick and lets kick some Ass!
