QuakeCon 2001 Workshop

I will be conducting a two-part workshop this year at QuakeCon. The workshop will be focused around head replacement models for team Arena. Part one will cover concepting and modeling while part two will move on into unwrapping and skinning. I currently have a head-pack in production and hope to coincide its release with QuakeCon. I am greatly looking forward to this years festivities and will be around the BYOC area for most of the event.

Well Ritual just got back from watching the Final Fantasy movie. Overall I thought it was a great film but was slow in a few places. I really enjoyed the underlying story. My only qualm is that it did not feel like it belonged in the Final Fantasy world. Other then that I would highly recommend it.

I spent the weekend playing the Gore demo from 4drulers
http://www.4drulers.com
This is a game that has a lot of potential but in the end falls short.

The Good:
Some of the features where really nice and they are obviously trying to do something a bit different. The use of Stamina adds a lot to the game play. As someone who likes to jump and continually keep moving I found it interesting that my character ran out of breath and his performance was greatly affected to an almost paralyzing state. You constantly have to pick up additional stamina or simply stop and let it build back up. This was a new twist on death match that I found very enjoyable until I ran out of stamina trying to flee from someone. :)
Another feature that I thought added to gameplay was the ability to blow up items and weapons. If you have someone on the ropes and they are trying to get to that extra health you can shoot it and it not only disappears but it causes damage too.
The weapons capabilities have a lot of potential. I am a big fan of alternate firing weapons. The rocket launcher/grenade launcher combinations worked great on the first map while on the second floor. I could peg people from across the room and at the same time drop grenades down to the second level. The Flamethrower was great while trying to defend. The “cocktail bomb” style secondary fire was great. If someone was on my tail I could quickly create a wall of fire between us. The energy style weapon was great. The primary fire did not seem very useful but the secondary fire was surprising. It seems to engulf its victim. Very nice. :)
The use of class-based characters is a great idea in conjunction with the stamina aspect but does fall a bit short.
They are claiming that it is easily modable over at the Skindom forums.
Over all I had fun.

The Bad:
The graphics where not as good as they could be and many of the effect where not visually pleasing. I know this is a beta but I think they have a lot of work to get it visually as nice as it is fun to play. The fire needs a lot of work. The movements of the characters did not always seem very smooth. The Rocket launcher, although quick firing, did not seem very powerful. It seemed to take several hits on a person to nock them out. I am a big fan of rocket launchers in FPS’s so I hope they play with it a bit more. The class-based characters, although a great idea, did not seem as effective as it could be. In a death match scenario, and on such small maps, I did not see enough of a difference.

The Verdict:
Knowing it is a beta and has a lot of work to go, I am looking forward to it. I really think it has a lot of potential. Based on the demo and if it were to ship tomorrow as a value game at $24.99 I would pick it up in a heartbeat do to the modability and the fun factor of it. If it were priced any more then I would have to pass it by.
I give it a 70% score

Well hell, It seems 3dpalette is in the process of switching servers, so that means my game editing website is down until they get things working again. I will try and have http://www.
