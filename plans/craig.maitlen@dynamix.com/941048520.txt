	Time seems to be flying.  We are working on defining the look of the 3rd world and tightening up the art for the previous 2.  Ian Christy has been kind enough to lend us a hand and is applying his talents for "rad" art on the Bioderm interiors.  You are going to love his work.  Maren and Jade have been finishing up all the really cool detail work they have redefined for the Blood Eagle interiors...very cool!!!!!  This game is going to be the best sequel ever..........man everything about the game is soooooo much more enhanced.  This isn't your fathers TRIBES (even though I am a father.........three times over).!
	Im very serious about finding out more about the audience out there.  Where are you from  and what do you do when your not saving the the TRIBES universe?  Send me a post card.........thanks.
	More to come about how to see more concept art and the lost journal of the Crusader and his adventures.


	thanks, jimmy

	Well it's the day after Black Tuesday and the TRIBES team is still standing.  Wheeeew..........
	On a completley different note I am going to be collecting postcards from players out in the Community.  Im currious to see how TRIBES has circumvented our globe.  Eventually I would like to compile the responces I receive and publish a TRIBES TimeCapsule of some sort.  Send your postcards to............

	It is with much sadness (and desire for his computer), that I say goodbye to the Conrster.  I will ( want his office) miss him both as a friend and fellow Tribes2 dude.  Thanks for (the hangover last weekend) all the support and general wackyness you have added to my experience on Tribes and T2.  It has been my pleasure to have worked with you..................jimmy ;) 


 
 
 
	It's that time again..............We have completed the environmental art for the second world.  Wow........... I think you are going to really like the feel of T2.  Everyone on the team is really doing their best work and it's showing.  I have to take a moment and thank Diane Lee and Wasif Azmat for the exceptional choice in beverages they sent the TRIBES team.  5 cases of Mirror Pond Pale Ale..........great stuff.  Thanks again!!!!

	Hello all,
			Everything seems to be going great.  We are busy concepting and getting into the production mode to create another 4 worlds as or even more exciting then the demo that was at E3.  Hope you got a chance to see it.  It takes your breath away.  Thanks to all who are faithfully supporting our game and I know for a fact that we are going to blow the doors off of this one.  More to come..............
