Q3A TEST
========
To quote Jerry Pournelle... "Real Soon Now".  Graeme's plan is the place
to go for the offical Q3A info.

The Matrix
==========
Go see it... this movie kicks ass.  Even if you don't like Keanu Reeves;
still go see it.

The Press
=========
First off, understand that I am definitely not a big Clinton supporter.
But yesterday I saw something that I took my opinion of the press (network
news type) to a new low.  Clinton was making a speach about the ongoing
NATO military operations is Kosovo.  He started out by thanking some of
the military leadership and his senior staff.  All of the sudden, the
commentator (it was ABC or CBS) starts talking over top of him!  "While
the President is thanking various staff and aides, I'd like to...".
What a freaking idiot!!!  I'm sorry, but I don't care what you might
think of the man; the office deserves respect.
