QuakeWorld Capture The Flag
---------------------------
  yep, I jumped in and squashed the grappling hook
  bug.  Happy New Years and have fun; back to work
  on Quake2 for me.

My predictions for 97
---------------------
Hey, why not?  Does anyone care?  Maybe not... but
here's a few SWAGs for the new year:

1) Network Computer:
	(aka Web TV)
	they'll flop again and again until people learn.
	Just like diskless workstations... they're a really
	good idea... for somebody else - *I* need a real
	machine.

2) DVD:
	(whaveter the hell it stands for these days)
	it will be a success... eventually.  They've
	botched any chance of a "take the world by
	storm" launch with all the public squabbling,
	but it's good technology and will make it
	despite them.

3) Cable modems:
	flop.  Cable companies can't even keep
	a unidirectional broadcast up reliably;
	who expects them to do better with point
	to point bidirectional data?  not me; I
	love my DSS!

4) 56kbps modems:
	(or whatever the next step is after the 33.6kbps is)
	they'll have the usual initial compatability problems
	and lack of ISP support, but they'll do great.  What
	is there to compete?  Everything else either costs
	a lot more or just isn't going to work that well.

5) The Internet
	No, there isn't going to be a "crash to end all crashes".
	Will there be outages? yes.  Will there be slowdowns?
	yes.  BUT... problems will be fixed and capacity increased
	because Corporate America (aka them, aka the guys with
	all the money) need it to keep working now.

There ya go.  PLEASE don't flood me with email about this.
Agree or disagree to your heart's content, but I'm not trying
to start anything here.  Just felt like taking a few pot
shots at the near future.
