Version 3.14 is ready and will be uploaded shortly.  We have both intel
and alpha versions ready.  I believe Zoid had the Linux version ready
and the latest CTF to boot.  So get them bits a burnin.  My apologies
to all the ISP's who are trying to figure out why all their links just
maxed out.

The game dll source will be uploaded tomorrow evening (tuesday, March 3rd)
provided there are no major problems encountered with this version.

There were no changes for fun/extended/whatever names.  I don't know how
to make it any clearer than saying we have no plans at all to change the
code that deals with names.  The only really good argument I've heard was
from somebody in europe who pointed out that there are a number of characters
used by other languages that reside in that part of the normal character maps.
I might have seen fit to do the work needed if we actually had those
characters in our table, but we do not.


Here's the bug fix list from 3.13 to 3.14
=========================================
Fixed a problem with target_laser; this was breaking the
laser drill in mine4

Made it so most client commands are disabled during
intermissions.  Only say, say_team, help, score, and
players are still allowed.

Fixed a problem with the bfg10k and power armor.  If
you fired the bfg and then took hits to the armor that
reduced your cells below 50, the bfg still fired and
you wound up with negative cells.

Stopped the player's weapon from drawing a really gross
looking shadow

Fixed a case with the game cvar not getting reset properly

Fixed hitting water after a high fall with jump held caused
falling damage as if you had hit solid ground.

Fixed the water warping effect in software was not being
cleared whan a player was moved to the intermission spot.

Rewrote a portion of the mouse input code.  Xian says it's
smoother and more responsive now.  Hopefully the m_filter
people will be happier too.

Fixed the wrong sound was being played when you ran out of
cells with power armor active

Fixed "give health "

Fixed "give armor" wasn't taking away lesser armor

Fixed "give all" was not giving a power screen

Added a cvar cl_minfps.  The default value is 5.  The game's
simulation framerate is clamped at this on the low side.

Added some client side code to check for bad key bindings
like "bind x +nosuchcommand" and not forward them to the server
and spam everyone

Fixed a bug where if you get a weapons icon up and invuse it
and then invdrop it before the current weapon has finished
dropping, you can drop the weapon and still use it even though
you don't have one in inventory anymore

Fixed binding to specific IP addresses was not working

Fixed typing pretty much anything at the console while connecting
caused a crash

Removed a bad call (closing a findhandle that was not open) in
the menu code for the models and skins

Fixed final drowning sound was not being played

Fixed a crash in ref_soft due to FOV > 90

By fixing some other problems, it is now possible to do a command
line like "map base1; god" and have it do what you would expect

Fixed power armor was taking damage when DF_NO_ARMOR was set

Changed it so that whenever "game" is changed, the autoexec.cfg for
that game will be executed if it exists.

Added more checks for the names and values of info cvars to prevent
bad ones from exisiting

Added a cvar called sv_reconnect_limit to stop yet another lamer's
idea of fun

Fixed a place in the client code where another client disconnecting
was causing it to generate names for and try to find files that do
not exist.  This was harmless, but produced message if you had set
developer 1.

Pretty sure I've finally solved the WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL problem.
