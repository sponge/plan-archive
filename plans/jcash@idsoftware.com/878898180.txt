Work Log
========
11/7
*fixed yet another problem with swimmers making it out of the water
*made flipper even faster; fish should be faster than a player is in the water
*fixed problem after having a grenade go off in your hand
*fixed railgun effect not showing if shot in to opaque liquids
*cleaned up code for handling armor damage
*fixed how power armor works.  screen now only protects from the front and will stop up to 33%
	of damage, shield gives 360 degeree protection and save up to 66%.
*made it so actors will not begin until targted
*fixed it so triggers can be used to make monsters mad at actors
*let actors have messages for the player

Deep Thoughts
=============
Saw "Starship Troopers".  Got just what I expected: cool effects with a B script
	and poor acting.  There were a couple of time I was rooting for the bugs!
	Dizzy or Carmen?  Give my vote to Dizzy!
