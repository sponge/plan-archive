Plan:
We're in the process of changing ISPs right now.  We will be getting
a DS3 (up to 45mbps) once the fiber can get pulled in.  Until then
we're ruuning with two T1 lines.  We're currently experiencing the
new line blues.  Ping times to our servers have been very bad for
the past day.  We are working on it and they should already be
getting better.  Please bear with us while we get the problems
worked out.

I've had fun with a new "feature" in Quake2 recently.  Let me just
say that if you like rocket jumping, you're going to love barrel
rocket jumping.  It's basically just a RJ off of an exploding barrel
(kind of like the slime cans in Doom), but man oh man can you catch
some air!  The level designers are already trying to figure out
good ways to reward people crazy enough to launch an explosive while
standing on another one.  You obviously won't be able to do this as
often as you can RJ (unless we let you carry barrels around), but it
sure is a cool ride when you do it.  Heh.  Carrying explosive barrels;
can you say "shoot me"?

Quake2 status in a nutshell: on schedule and looking great.  NO, I am
NOT going to name any dates.

Current German stuff: bier!  I found a local place that has 60 different
German beers; a fair number of them on tap.  30 hell (light), 30 dunkel
(dark)... I'm working my way down the list.
