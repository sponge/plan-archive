Thanks
------
A special thanks to Mark Fisher over in the UK.  He helped
me out with a nasty math problem I was looking at.  I'm glad
there are people out there who like math enough to actually
remember all of that stuff; I was not looking forward to
breaking out the trigonometry books to do it myself.  I did
have the base problem correct, but I couldn't remember all
those nifty trig transforms needed to actually reduce and solve
the thing.  I probably ought to get the books out and relearn
some of that stuff; it's not fun knowing you used to know the
answer but don't anymore.  Thanks Mark, have fun in Switzerland.
I'll be putting it to good use, I assure you.

Point Release (3.12)
--------------------
It's in Activision's testers hands right now.  That means we
should be able to release it Real Soon Now.  Looks like Zoid
is on track too.

Diet Update
-----------
There was a Twinkie and Ho-Ho recall in 20 some states last
week.  Don't they know that those are staples of my diet?  It's
been rought, but I survived with a few substitutions.  Watch
out Hostess, I've been hangin' out with Little Debbie.  It was
scary, but at least it wasn't a recall of beer or red meat!
