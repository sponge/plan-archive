id stuff
========

Quake3
------
Working converting everything over for the new fixed
virtual reolustion console that John mentioned.  The
font is now a code page 850 like set so those of you
who don't happen to have English as your native language
will have all the letters in your alphabet available.
As before, some of the extra slots are being used for
graphics parts.  There characters *are* available for
use in your name.  The font was bumped up in size from
8x8 to 16x16, although the rendered resolution may be
different because of the virtual console size.  The
font itself is just white now.  Colored text is being
done a different way now.  Some places we will force
the text to be draw in a single, fixed color.  Others
it will start out white, but can be changed mid-string.
That includes your name!  Yes, the return of the fun
name... with a vengeance!  If anoyone would start a
petition if I disabled animated names, please tell me
now.  They are a bad waste of bandwidth and right now
I plan to stop that with "no name spamming" code.

Sayeth the Hook: Someone else asked "Why not the M3?"

Pros:

- pretty fast
	stock: 0-60 5.5-5.7, 1/4 mile 14.2-14.7 (corrected this today!!!)
	(depends on which rags you read)
- "sleeper" appeal
	I say "stealth"
- not very expensive (relatively speaking)
	60-65% the price of a Viper GTS or Porsche 911
	expensive, just not *very* expensive
- seats 4 comfortably
	quite comfortably, 5 if someone will take "the hump"

Cons:

- 15% of id employees already have a black M3
	15% have Vipers, 22.5% have Porsches (15% are 911s)
	contrary to popular belief, only 1 has Ferraris
- Cash's M3 is having a supercharger installed
	"just had" a supercharger installed 8-)
- not exotic enough
	"sleeper" and exotic are kinda mutually exculsive

I'm not arguing with Brian here.  The Viper and the M3 are
very different cars.  As Carmack said, the Viper suits Brian.
I think the M3 is a pretty good match for me too.

The supercharger is way cool.  Don't think Top Fuel Dragster
or a giant chrome scoop sticking through the hood.  It's still
very stealthy.  It's a totally under the hood setup.  The
install is very clean; looks like it could have come from the
factory that way.  There is a definite change in the sound...
kind of a low growl that's underneath of all the old sounds.
In a couple of weeks I should be able to get the ECU
reprogrammed and get the rest of the power out of it; right
now peak HP is at the redline.  I'm kinda sad that it wasn't
ready in time for the drag strip last week but things don't
always work out.  I'll be there next time!  I don't have any
timings on the car yet.  Looks like HP raised from stock 240
to 330 right now.  The ECU fix should bring that up to about
355.
