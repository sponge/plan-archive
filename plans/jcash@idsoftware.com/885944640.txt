Still testing.  Looks like Zoid may be able to release CTF
at about the same time so it could turn out to be quite a day
for releases when it hits.

Fair warning... some changes had to be made to the game API
(the interface to the game dll), so once the point release
comes out, all mods will need to be recompiled with the new
headers at a minimum.  Of course, you'll be much better off
if you just re-mod the new source since there are a ton of
changes.  We'll put the game dll source out close on the heels
of the release; I know you'll be anxious to get it.

There were come protocol changes too, so this release will not
be backwards compatible to older versions.  I tried to avoid
it, but it was necessary.

Happy Birthday Johnny!!!  Yes, my eldest son turns 7 today.
Man, they do grow up fast.  It seems like only yesterday he
got his first frag.  It seems like this morning when he
went to his first QuakeCon and won two matches.  Thresh had
better keep up on his skills if he wants to keep that Ferrari;
this kid's a killer ;-)

On a related note... have you been practicing Esses?  He's
ready for a rematch.  Or maybe you'd rather play Joey, my
3 year old? ;-)  Fair warning...  Joey's first frag ever was
an axe murder!
