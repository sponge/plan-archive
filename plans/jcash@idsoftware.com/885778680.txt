QuakeII
-------
No real update.  Testing is progressing.  It's already paid
off with a few good finds.  I'd almost forgotten how much fun
coop can be... unless you're a monster being charged by four
crazed maniacs with railguns.  Oh yeah, it's *really* hard to
convince the other players that you didn't mean to kill them
when you use the BFG10K in a small room. ;-)

1998
----
Thanks for the responses.  Man, I had an 80% success rate.
Glad I didn't try again this year, I hear it's hard to repeat ;-)

Super Bowl
----------
Congrats to the Denver Broncos on winning Super Bowl XXXII.
Also to John Elway for a victory earned a long time ago.  I
guess the entire AFC owes them thanks for breaking the NFC's
streak.  Finally, congrats to both teams for finally giving
the fans a real, live, four quarter long game to watch.

Loser Bowl
----------
The Minnesota Vikings and the Buffaloe Bills have the dubious
distinction of having lost 5 Super Bowls each (that's a tidy
31.25% of all the Super Bowls played).  So I say let's have a
loser's bracket game between these two so one of them can get
on with things.
