Yikes!  Been way too long without an update here.

1998
----
Did ya know that 1998 = 666+666+666?  As sCary would
say, "like... Happy New Year and stuff".  Does anyone
have my predictions I made last january?  I forgot to
save them off; I'm kinda curious how I did.

QuakeII
-------
The next release is nearing completion.  It will be
out, dare I say it, "When It's Done". heh.  It will
NOT be in the next week.  We're putting this one
through some real good testing so we can avoid doing
rapid fire releases again.

The release has a bunch of bug fixes, but you already
knew that.  Some of the other things include:
	Cooperative play - including load and save
	CTF support - not CTF, stuff that CTF needed
	More DM options - including obituaries
	NAT support - that's Network Address Translation

A couple of the fixes will feel like new features since
they were borked before.  Like teamplay and rcon, for
example.

Please don't email me asking if feature here> has been added.  You'll know soon enough
and I'm done adding stuff.

Miscellaneous Ramblings
-----------------------
This is stuff I just wanna go off about a bit.  Watch
for large doses of sarcasm.  I'll try to keep it PG-13.
Or is that TV-MA-11-BEFORE8-3.1415-USA...  guess you
could say I'm not a big fan of those silly TV ratings.

Clinton.  heh.  His people say it's a embarassment to
the whole nation to allow our President to be made to
stand trial.  So, is like say, having him going around
poking 21 year old coeds going to improve this image?
Of course we all know she's lying.  Or is she lying about
lying?  Or is that lying about not lying???  Ummmm...
now I'm confused.  Oh wait, that's the whole idea, isn't
it?  I guess Paula Jones is lying too.  And so are all
those other women.  Except Hillary, of course.
