Plan:
>>> Quake <<<

8/1:
*fixed names with spaces showing up as unconnected
*added code to look for old clients that do names with spaces
	incorrectly and handle that case


8/7:
*fixed the "Mod_NumForName: %s not found" bug


8/8:
*fixed getting stuck on start map with noexit on
*fixed getting stuck on end map (must have a frag or time limit)
*made it so when levels are advancing by limit you'll go through
	all 4 episodes on a registered server


8/9:
*fixed it so dead players don't keep their stuff if the level changes
*setting of crosshair is now saved on config.cfg
*removed dumpscore and printclientscore from progs; they were unused


8/12:
*fixed so a CCREQ_RULE_INFO with an invalid name will not crash
	the server


8/14:
*fixed using percent signs in a chat message would fault the server


8/21:
*progs fixes:
	cells are no longer carried over to the start level
	you could kill shub the wrong way; now you can't
	fixed "killing" a secret door causing a host_error
	cells are no longer picked up when you already have 100
	if you discharge, cells are now removed before the backpack drops


8/23:
*first cut of IPX support for WinQuake
*center rankings screen for high res
*give blood
*prep work for additional controller support


8/26:
*Fix the T1 (again)
*crosshair was drawn wrong underwater at high res
*doing restart or edict when a server wasn't running crashed


8/27:
*spaceball support


8/28:
*tuned spaceball support


8/29:
*assasin support

8/30:
*tuned assassin support
*made "backup past 0" a developer message


9/3:
*exit to quake console instead of OS when a net game fails to load


9/4:
*added teamplay 2
	you can hurt teamates (and yourself)
	you lose 1 frag for killing a teamate
*create code area for licensees
*spaces were being added onto bindings when config.cfg was read
*a binding to ";" is now written to config.cfg properly
*unbound keys no longer written to config.cfg


9/9:
*severly limited what commands and vars can be changed remotely
*showscores doesn't work in total full screen (no menu bar at all)
*axe wasn't always aimed properly making hits/misses wrong
*cycle weapon backwards
*differentiate between ranking screens for death and level change
	they are: end of level doesn't have anything at the bottom
*picking up a weapon in a backpack should use normal changing rules
*fixed incorrect "fell to his death" reports
*fixed up obituaries; they can still be wrong, but a lot less often
	mainly grenade deaths can be mis-reported
*bitch at Sprint cuz they can't keep the damn internet connection up


9/13:
*make DYNAMIC_SIZE a param
*dot dot
*make winquake IPX work with DOS IPX
*build 1.05 release (winded and DOS)


9/18:
*fixed a lockup when multiplayer was selected, but there
	were no communications available
*timeddemo was not showing the timings at the end
*fixed progs so lightning gun is never considered your best
	weapon when you are underwater
*fixed not being able to bind the semicolon from the menu
*made not being able to write a PCX file a warning instead
	of a sys_error


9/19-9/20:
*New York City, Quake release party
	311 (my clan) ripped Dark Requiem (with Tokay) to shreds
		go see American's suddenly very quiet finger file
			no more slams on 311	8-)
		311 and Unholy Alliance still need to have a showdown
			we both pulverized our opponents, but never got to play
	real audio broadcast
	drank stuff
	ate stuff
	signed stuff


9/23:
*fixed cd audio volume acting oddly with certain drives
*update: American decides to slam 311 again; possible explanations
	- he's in denial and really doesn't remember the beating they got
	- he figures they might be able to win a "coolest t-shirt" match
	- he confused our ages with the number of frags his clan's
	  members got (under 21)
	- "told Cash he looked too young to drink"
		at my age that is NOT an insult :-)


9/24:
*fixed spawn/respawn telefrags
	when spawning (or respawning) you it will now search and find
		any open start spot, not just blindly go to the next one
	you will only telefrag somebody if every single spot is occupied
		in that case the last person in gets whacked; this keeps us
		from getting right back into the rolling telefrags at the
		start of a level and gives the first guys in a chance to get
		off of the spots
	teleporter telefrags have not been changed
*notify what weapon picked up in backpack
*don't print "player exited the level" in single player
*added kick by number so people with "funny" names can be removed
	Bane inadvertently assists with testing ;-)
*bumped version number to 1.06
*new GUS code: supports GUS Classic & fixes playback rate

9/29:
*fixed visiting exit level twice in a row (internal)
*added noexit 2; same as noexit except you can exit the start level
*fixed it so numeric addresses in the "connect to" box can be
	followed by a colon and a port number
*fixed the port number on the menus so it works
*fixed the lightning gun discharge ghost problem


10/2:
*release 1.06


10/3:
*I hereby formally accept American's challange to a one on one DeathMatch.
	The game rules:
		we play at work, both on our blazingly fast P90s
		version 1.06 and a dedicatd server
		I get to pick the level; I'll give him advance notice
			once I decide on the level
		we both record demos of the match
			we ought to get an audio recording of the match too ;-)
		fraglimit 20
		all other cvars standard for that level
	date and time:
		I'm going to Disney World next week, so after that
			I'll try for that next week; no later than the second week
		Neither of us are morning people, so I'd suggest a time
			either late afternoon or later
		Maybe really early the morning after ddt's bachelor party?!? ;-)
*Timmy is back from vacation
	He had a religious experience while in Europe; see if you figure out
	which of these was it:
		1) Visiting the Vatican
		2) Seeing the Ferrari factory
		3) Going to the nude beach in France


10/4:
Client side demos were broken?  DOH!!!  Believe it or not,
	nobody had told me about that one ;-(


10/5-10/11:
I'm going to Disney World!  A week without the net or a decent
	game of Quake....  aaargh!!!  Guess I'll survive ;-)

10/28:
Yes, I did come back from Disney World.
	Tower of Terror - kicks ass!
	Johnny (my 5 year old) rode evrything but Space Mountain
		(too short) and Tower of Terror (too scary)
	Joey (my 2 year old) ate evrything he could and got
		a really good yank on Tigger's tail
	Tropical Storms SUCK (first two days == very wet)
Sorry for the lack of updates, but I've been working on Quake2
	and, as you've probably noticed, we're not saying a whole lot
	about it right now.  We're just trying not to go out
	hyping it and later find out that we couldn't actually do
	some of the stuff.
Hi mom!
Meanwhile back at the ranch...
*fixed client side demos
*fixed ipx for winquake on win95
*fixed wrong total monster count
	For all you progs programmers; look in monsters.qc
	and remove the line "total_monsters = total_monsters + 1;"
	in the function "swimmonster_start_go".
*wrote CD Audio support for WinQuake
Other "news"...
No, American and I have *still* not done the match
	We really are going to... really!  I'm just trying
	to catch him when he's got a really bad hangover ;-)
I've finally bought my "id car":
	M3, Bright Red, 2 door, manual (of course)
	Faster than American's MR2
	Faster than Tim's Mustang
	NOT as fast as any of the Carmack clan's cars
	Did I mention it's faster than American's car? ;-)
Got the new Marilyn Manson and KMFDM albumns
	new music to annoy the wife and neighbors (hey, the kids like it!)
Dentists are evil: "slight discomfort", yeah right

10/29:
Beware of idiots who are putting % in their names.  There's a problem
	in the code that prints the obituaries (so-and-so killed so-and-so)
	that can crash the server if a name has a % in it.  Thanks to
	Zakk for sending me the info to find this one.

10/30:
There's a case where listen servers don't listen.  If you start
	quake with "-listen" and then use the menu to start a multiplayer
	game it will start but won't accept any players.  You can correct
	it by doing "listen 1" from the console.
Cool factoid: in German, Bright Red is "hellrot"

11/1:
*Sent off source to get the 1.06 Linux version done.
Tim just got a Mortal Kombat II machine.  Productivity may suffer.

11/3:
My anniversary; 12 years today

11/4:
*fixed the lighning gun ammo bug
	in player.qc, functions player_light1 and player_light2
	change the line "if (!self.button0)" to
	"if ((!self.button0) || (self.currentammo == 0))"
	remember to do it both places!
*fixed a bug with CDs with more than 32 tracks
	Examples:	Marilyn Manson		Antichrist Superstar
				Nine Inch Nails		Broken
American is back from Mexico
	time to finally play our match
	now he wants to race too; wonder why ;-)
My productivity won't suffer from having the MKII machine
	I'd forgotten how bad I am at that game

11/5:
Joey's 2nd birthday; let the terrible twos begin
Don't forget to vote...
	I hope one of the choices is "None of the Above"
	Bill "tax cut, retro tax increase, whatever" Clinton
	Bob "Put down that pen!" Dole
	Ross "Ears" Perot
*voted
	"None of the above" wasn't on the ballot
	Wonder if anyone else wrote in Carmack?

11/13:
still alive, working on Quake2
if you're using winded for servers, check out qhost/qview at

speaking of cool stuff, check out the Quake Comics at
	http://www.webframes.com/quakecomics/

11/15:
thanks to Steve Otteson for today's "Cool German word of the day"
	and to Dominik Volmer for correcting the spelling ;-)
	Schutzfehlerverletzung - General Protection Fault
