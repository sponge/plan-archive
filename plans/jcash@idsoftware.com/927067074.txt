Q3TEST
======

IPX: The current build of Q3TEST's IPX support is broken.  I have
fixed it for the next release.

SOCKS: My early testing was using a Linux based SOCKS server.  I had
to make a fix to work with Cisco's implementation; it seems I had a
preliminary version of the RFC.  So if your one of the small handful
of people using Cisco equipment to connect to the net <grin>, this
should work for you in the next release.  I'm sure this will make Q3A
work with other vendor's SOCKS servers too.  There is one more case
where it isn't working (WSAEAFNOSUPPORT errors) that I'm looking into.  The
username/password authentication has been added.

To save on email... there is not a date set for the next release.
