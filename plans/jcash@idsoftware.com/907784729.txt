For those of you who have wondered just how often
people try to hack into a game company's network,
here's a little factiod to give you an idea.  Over
a timespan of approximately 16 hours, there were
59,167 "events" logged by our firewall.  In this
case, an event is a packet attempting to come in
through our firewall to a destination which is not
allowed.  For example, trying to ftp to a machine
other than ftp.idsoftware.com.  Just to be clear,
these are certainly not all hacking attempts.

The reason I was watching even more closely than
normal is that, as many of you noticed, our internet
connection was down for several hours yesterday.
As the internet has grown, so has the level of
router required to connect in at higher levels.  In
our case, our year old router which was up to the
task of running BGP when we got it, is no longer
up to the task.  The routing tables have simply
gotten too large and we no longer have enough memory
to handle it.  They have actually been too large for
a while now, but the router was able to cope with
it at reduced performance.  But the doo doo hit
the reciprocating blades yesterday and the router
went belly up.

Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused
you.  We worked out a interim solution with our ISP
and have things back running, although less than
optimally as we had to revert to static routing for
now.  We are mulling over our options and will get
things back to normal (maybe better) as soon as
possible.
