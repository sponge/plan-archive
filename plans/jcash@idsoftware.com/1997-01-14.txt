Plan:
Well, we did it.  American and I *finally* had our deathmatch.
He won 10-8; I guess I should be sad I lost, but since he was
expecting something like 20 to -2... I'll take it.  The demos
are being uploaded so you can see for yourselves.  I'm Hellrot
and he's Tokay.  OK, now for the hard part:

Congratulations American.

Oh yeah, you can stop the mail bombing now, OK.
