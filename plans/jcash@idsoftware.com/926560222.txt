Q3A TEST
========
Stuck behind a firewall and think you can't play Q3ATEST?

Q3ATEST has support for SOCKS5 (RFC-1928).  Well, at least the wintel version
does... I'm not certain it has been picked up for the Mac and Linux code yet;
I'll have to check on that and take care of it.  There are three cvars that
control it.  They are only settable from the at init time (from the command
line).

+set net_socksEnabled 1
+set net_socksServer <SOCKS server address>
+set net_socksPort <SOCKS server port number>

Please note that you use the address (name or IP number) of the SOCKS server
(firewall machine), NOT a Q3ATEST server.  The port number defaults to 1080,
you should not need to change this.

Currently it does not do any authentication.  It would be pretty easy to add
the username/password authentication method (RFC-1929); I will do so if there
are people who need it.  The odds of us doing the GSS-API method (RFC-1961),
however, are not very good.  I am only supporting IPv4 addresses; I mention this
just to satisfy the curiosity of people who know SOCKS and would have asked.

This piece of code has not been beaten on very much.  If you have/need/want to
try it out, please let me know how it works out for you.  Thanks!


SOCKS Update
=============
Several people pointed out I had a type in yesterday's update.  I had "net_sockEnabled"
but it should have been "net_socksEnabled".

Also I need to clear about the comment about the command line.  These settings are not
entered from the Q3A console command line.  I meant the OS command line.  For example,
in a Win98 "MS-DOS Prompt" you would enter "quake3 +set net_sock...".  Or in a shortcut
you would add it onto the "target".

I've gotten a few emails about it, so I'll go ahead and add the username/password
(RFC-1929) authentication.  Fortunately nobody has asked for the GSS-API stuff.


Episode 1
=========
I admit it... I AM READY!!!
