Just read on Slashdot that Sony plans to release a version of Linux for
the PS2 (http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/04/26/1340202&mode=thread).
This is great news!  It's always disappointed me that current consoles
weren't programmable like some of the early systems were.  I first started
programming on a Bally Arcade using the BASIC language cartridge that shipped
with the system and later moved to an Atari 800 (though it wasn't really priced
as a console).

Consoles tend to be more friendly and less imposing than a PC.  While Linux
is a bit more hefty than popping in a BASIC language cartridge, at least it's
a start towards opening up consoles to the hobbyist programmer.  It also
opens up the possibility of some really neat applications of the PS2 in the
home.

Of course, YABasic (in Europe) and Artdink's Basic Studio are also nice
solutions.

Robert came in today with a copy of Serious Sam by Croteam.  The game is
a blast to play and to watch!  By the second level Duffy had 5 guys watching 
over his shoulder (there probably would have been more, but half the
company is out at CGDC).  For $20, Serious Sam is a total deal.

Buy it!  I want to see more games from Croteam! :)
