----------
If we are too young our judgement is impaired; just as it is if we are too old.

  Thinking too little about things or thinking too much both make us obstinate and fanatical.
  If we look at our work immediately after completing it, we are still too involved; if too long afterwards, we cannot pick up the thread again.
  It is like looking at pictures which are too near of too far away.  There is just one indivible point which is the right place.
  Others are too near, too high, or too low.  In painting the rules of perspective decide it, but how will it be decided when it comes to truth and morality?

 - Blaise Pascal,  Pensees
