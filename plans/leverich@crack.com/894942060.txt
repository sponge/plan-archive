	Fixed addicted.. crackcam should be cranking again.
 
	Um.. I need money.  If anyone in the austin area would like to hire
	me for slave network / unix programing labor for a decent wage and
	variable hours, send me some email (Austin area only).

	Hey hey, look at me! I got fed up with pretty much every editor,
	so I switched over to vi. After reading "the complete elvis 
	documentation" I am so hooked on vi, it's just got too many features
	to not be irresistable. Watch out emacs!

	Forgot to add this entry on Nov 10th, but basically
	I setup a little guest ftp account so Vito could
	update the webpage on his own and so we don't have
	to compromise security.
