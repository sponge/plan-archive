Plan:
03.01.02 ===============================

The Muskat pin will be put on the line this weekend.  With unification 
possible i'll need to be on my A-game.  Radle....bring it!!!!


02.17.02 ===============================

Migrated DnBreaks Radio from the remote disk array to a local 80GB 
drive and turned on crossfading.  The station sounds 10x better now.

Picked up the Muskat pin trophy....which almost turned into a disaster 
when John left the trophy on the BART train and forgot about it.  He 
ended up having to jump back on the train and go to the next stop before 
he could get to the car he'd been sitting in and rescuing it.  Of course 
if he'd really lost it, he'd probably been beaten severely. :)

Beta 3 launched....woohoo!!!


01.31.02 ===============================

Tons of shit has gone down this month.  Most notably my boss 
decided to leave the group for the Innovations center.  It 
sounds pretty cool for him but it means that i've been spending a 
disproportionate amount of time in meetings and helping the new 
bossman to come up to speed on winamp, wasabi, shoutcast, etc.  
The good thing though is that it's helping spread the word about 
Winamp and Wasabi.  So far it's all been received well.

More importantly, I recently dethroned my good friend John Radle as 
bowling champion.  My next feat of superior sportsmanship is to 
beat Doug E. Fresh in the next round....thereby reuniting the Muskat 
Pin bowling trophy.



12.03.01 ===============================

Maceo Parker for New Year's.........awwwwwww yeah!



11.06.01 ===============================

Tried to take over the world again today...not enough leggo's
....maybe tomorrow.

Just noticed that Denny thinks he's "too good at foosball".  
Exhibit A, tiramisu once belonging to Denny recently eaten by 
myself following a vicious beating in foosball.  Rematch?


11.04.01 ===============================

The Yankees lost the World Series in the bottom of the 9th...
poetic justice some would say....i just say "fuck shit".
