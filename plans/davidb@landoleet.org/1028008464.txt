07.29.02 ===============================

it seems like everyone around me is spontaneously getting married...
i guess i've reached that age...
I'm certainly happy enough for my friends, they're all marrying awesome people 
but still it feels a bit sad.

in other news, jay paul is a fucking rockstar at the 10-20 holdem table....one 
step closer to the WSOP...nice work

radle, good job bringing the trophy back to SF.....it just means that i'll have 
a chance to reclaim the bowling title sooner....get ready biatch!!!

07.14.02 ===============================

3 birthday parties this week....dear god...any more cake and i'm going to die.

winamp3 is really starting to kick some serious ass.  i'm using it as my 
default player now.  trying to focus on bug-fixing and resolving some 
easily addressible usability issues.

After swearing off craps for over a year I gave it another try over the 
holiday weekend.  This was a good time....I was up ~$160 but then lost about 
half.  Even so, it's way better than the last time when i lost $200 in 30 
minutes up in Tahoe.

Started ripping my entire collection of CD's to 192kbps MP3.  I haven't 
touched my CD player in weeks....it's great.  I even use this StreamZap thing.
It works great except that it doesn't work with winamp3 yet.

Steve, you suck at FIFA....i own you.


03.01.02 ===============================

The Muskat pin will be put on the line this weekend.  With unification 
possible i'll need to be on my A-game.  Radle....bring it!!!!


02.17.02 ===============================

Migrated DnBreaks Radio from the remote disk array to a local 80GB 
drive and turned on crossfading.  The station sounds 10x better now.

Picked up the Muskat pin trophy....which almost turned into a disaster 
when John left the trophy on the BART train and forgot about it.  He 
ended up having to jump back on the train and go to the next stop before 
he could get to the car he'd been sitting in and rescuing it.  Of course 
if he'd really lost it, he'd probably been beaten severely. :)

Beta 3 launched....woohoo!!!


01.31.02 ===============================

Tons of shit has gone down this month.  Most notably my boss 
decided to leave the group for the Innovations center.  It 
sounds pretty cool for him but it means that i've been spending a 
disproportionate amount of time in meetings and helping the new 
bossman to come up to speed on winamp, wasabi, shoutcast, etc.  
The good thing though is that it's helping spread the word about 
Winamp and Wasabi.  So far it's all been received well.

More importantly, I recently dethroned my good friend John Radle as 
bowling champion.  My next feat of superior sportsmanship is to 
beat Doug E. Fresh in the next round....thereby reuniting the Muskat 
Pin bowling trophy.



12.03.01 ===============================

Maceo Parker for New Year's.........awwwwwww yeah!



11.06.01 ===============================

Tried to take over the world again today...not enough leggo's
....maybe tomorrow.

Just noticed that Denny thinks he's "too good at foosball".  
Exhibit A, tiramisu once belonging to Denny recently eaten by 
myself following a vicious beating in foosball.  Rematch?


11.04.01 ===============================

The Yankees lost the World Series in the bottom of the 9th...
poetic justice some would say....i just say "fuck shit".
