Politcal stuff first...then gaming

US Teaches the World a Lesson Again. Oddly enough the lessons of decades past seems 
to escape some people. British and French inactivity against Hitler prior to WWII
led to a near collapse of western Europe at the hands of Germany. If we remain quiet
chances are this type of terrorist attack will continue. There may be some retaliation 
(I hope not) by Islamic extremist but they now know what price they must pay. Hopefully
other "peaceful" nations and our citizens will remember the price of freedom. The 300+ people
killed in the embassy bombings know. 

After working in the government for years and seeing how things operate, I 
doubt seriously this was used to divert attention from a torrid sexual 
affair. That would be like saying the Arab-Israeli conflicts of the mid 
seventies was created to divert attention from Watergate. Gee people...get 
a life. Off the Soap box and onto some gaming issues

Dan put out the list of the 5 most overused design elements. I will add 
the 5 most desired elements as I see it that are missing by most games, 
except note that Deus Ex will use these and I am seeing to it that they 
will be there.

Five Most Needed Elements That Should Be Added To Games
1. Plentiful use of sound effects and using them correctly.
2. Clever use of suspense to heighten emotions in the player rather than throwing everything at them.
3. Intelligent reasoning for alarm systems and traps
4. Good writing for character dialogue (not, "I am a picker of locks, Take these lock picks...") 
5. A solid testing cycle so that the game does not need constant patching.
