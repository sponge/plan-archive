Hi.


10/23/98

Yesterday was ALLL HERETICS DAY!  But, since the demo was just
a bit late... I think today should be ALL HERETICS DAY! We have
been busting our asses to get this demo out, and a hardy "High-
Five" goes out to our crack team of programmers for spilling their 
guts making this damn demo ROCK!  Thanks to the whole team... we
all ROCK!

If you are out there playing some deathmatch on the Raven server 
today or in the near future, I have but one word of warning.  BEWARE!  
The mEATwagon is on the loose, and we are hungry.  I am the salty 
BLACK_ANGUS and my fellow meatmen and I will be there from time to time 
wreaking havok with our meaty madness.  To quote Kintukeefryd "Wiseman 
say, don't mess with the mEAT!"

Play the demo... love the demo
