With all the feedback I have recieved I have 
come to a conclusion on the campers issue.  
Some are bad, some are not so bad. Campers 
are a neccessary evil.  If done wisely, they 
may even be cool, as a wiseman from Finland 
pointed out to me.  I still like to rain 
death upon them, however.  That shall never 
change.  So there!

Hey Bob, I think you should bring back Angry
Glenn.  Just knowing that he was going to 
kick the hell out of that squirt Peepo was
a comforting thought which made my days more 
bearable.  Just a thought.

The topic for today is: Campers.  The life you take,
just may be theirs.  

Send me some feedback.  Campers, do ya like them, or 
do ya want to turn them into goo.  Tell me what 
YOU think.

I hate campers, personally.  The only fun thing they 
add to the game is hunting them down and killing them.
But basically they are a pain in the ass.
Now I'm not talking about the kind of camper that takes
a tent into the woods and drinks beer all weekend.  I'm
talking about the kind that sits in the nooks and 
crannies of the 'ol Q2dm levels and snipes with the damn
railgun.  My mission, it seems, is to take out these
bastards with extreme prejudice.

I usually cruise the Gamespy 3-D Quake 2dm's under the 
name of DeadBodyguard.  If you've read Bob Love's .plan
then you know who the hell I am.  Incidently, if you read
his story (which f*@$ing rocks), send him an e-mail and 
tell him what ya think. And if ya see me running around 
out there in Gamespy land, say hello, then shoot me in 
the head.

Thanks for listening to (or reading in this case) my rant.
