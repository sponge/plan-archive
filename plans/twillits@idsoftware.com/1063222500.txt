Technical Help Requested with Bluetooth Connectivity: Complete

I want to thank everyone who sent me email. I was able to successful get on the internet with my Clie via my Nokia 3650 phone. I needed to enter in a script on my Clie that worked with my phone. My connection does drop sometimes when its connected so Im still going to look into getting that resolved but luckily the bigger issues was resolved.

If I had a Sony cell phone it would have worked fine, but I really like the functionality of the 3650.

Thanks again to those who helped.
