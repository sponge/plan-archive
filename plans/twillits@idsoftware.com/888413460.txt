Hello

I want to thank everyone who wrote me concerning the deathmatch levels. I read every e-mail, tried to figure out what was the general consensus on each level then relay that to the appropriate designer. Your comments were intelligent and well thoughtout and I know we will be able to use them to help us in the future.

A couple of you asked who did which level so I thought I would list them.

q2dm1 -The Edge - Willits
q2dm2 -Tokay's Tower's - American
q2dm3 -Frag Pipe - American
q2dm4 -Lost Hallways - Brandon (KILLME)
q2dm5 -The Pits - Brandon (KILLME)
q2dm6 -The Lava Tomb - American
q2dm7 -Slimy Place - American
q2dm8 -Warehouse - Christian

base64 - Willits
Sewer64 - Christian
City64 - Paul Jaquays

Thanks
Tim
