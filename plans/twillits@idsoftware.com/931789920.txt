As you have heard, we are working on releasing another version of the test. This new 
version of the test will require you to download all of the data again. Many of you might 
not immediately see this as a good thing, but it is!!! This gives me the opportunity to 
make some minor bug fixes to Q3test1. If there is anything in the map that you feel is a 
"bug" please drop me an email and I'll try to fix it before the next test release.

Examples of some good bug fix suggestions: 

1. Sometimes when I round the corner out of the rocketlauncher room towards 
the plasma room I see a vis error at the top of the steps.
2. I get stuck when I back into the corner on the left side of the steps leading up 
towards the rocketlauncher in the courtyard.

Examples of some bad bug fix suggestions that I DON"T want you to email me:

1. This map plays nothing like Q3test2 and it basically sucks.
2. Make it more like the Edge, that's my favorite map!!
3. I can't believe you put two rocketlaunchers in the map.You are dumb!!


Thanks again for everyone's feedback on the test and the levels.

Personal note:

A few weeks ago Joe Rogan, (actor/comedy) from the television show "News Radio", 
paid a visit to the id offices. During a smack talking who can kick who's ass I told him 
that if he beats me in a 1 on 1 that I would I mention my defeat in my next .plan update. I 
lost by a point so there I go.....     Him and his comic sidekick Chris McGuire are 
currently touring the country performing live stand-up comedy. The show is very funny 
and I recommend seeing them if they are in your town.
