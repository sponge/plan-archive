Hello

I haven't updated my .plan in awhile, not much to say that's why. Quake3 Arena is coming along nicely.

If you have seen the March issue of Next Generation then you probably noticed John Carmack wearing the very cool Quake 3 Arena jersey in some of the pictures.  The jerseys where initially created for the folks at
id.  However, due to the enormous request for these jerseys, Action
Imprints, the company that created the jerseys for us, will make them
available for purchase to the general public.  Further information can be
found at:
