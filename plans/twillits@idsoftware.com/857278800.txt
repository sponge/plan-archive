You have reached Tim Willits at Id Software.

Hello

This will be the last regular update to my .plan.  When I started my .plan
it was to contrast John's oh-so boring and dry .plan and show a
little humor here at id.  Unfortunately I just don't have time to
update it as much as I would like, I'm just too busy.  Anyway
American and John Cash seem to be funny enough for all of us. 
I am working very hard on Quake 2 and feel that 1997 will be a great
year for id.  

Thanks Tim

P.S. I'm not dead, I just need to focus on the job at hand.

========================================================

Only a quick note...

I just got done watching the latest Rangers movie and I have to tell you
that it is the coolest thing

I have seen for Quake.  I am extremely impressed.

=======================================================
Here are the things that kept me so busy I just didn't have time to update my .plan for so long.

Things I've been doing.....

-Manually inputting all 100 CD names into my CD player.
-Setting up my new Intergraph mac-daddy machine.
-Rearranging the desktop on my new machine.
-Deciding what theme to put on the newly arranged desktop.
-Playing internet Deathmatch (You all are getting so good that I think
 I'm going to stop playing until Quake 2 comes out so I know
 where everything is and you don't!)
-Listening to American and John Cash fight about who's better at DeathMatch.
-Listening to everyone else laugh at them.
-Rollarblading with Lona and John.
-Playing Super Mario 64---like everyone else-----
-Playing my new Mortal Kombat II video arcade machine.
-Wondering how much more great our games are going to be with
 one more artist at id.
-Probing into Paul Steed's life---He's the new artist, send him mail
 and say hello.   psteed@idsoftware.com
-Moving from my little apartment into a house.
-Changing the theme on my newly arranged desktop.


OK, my next posting will be a list of the WORST Quake levels on the internet.
If you know of any really bad levels send me the names.


=============================================================
I'm back from vacation and extremely busy. I'll tell you guys about all the fun
things I did on my trip as soon as I have a minute to spare.


===============================================================
Hello Its been a long time since I update my .plan file.  I've been busy
designing Quake 2 and haven't had a lot of time to goof off, but when I
did find time this is what I did.......

-Decorated my new office.
-Downloaded Quake C stuff from the net and played with them all day
 (called it research).
-Made John Cash write some new weapon code and played with it all day
 (called it research).
-Helped John C test Quake World deathmatch and played all day (You guess).
-Bought the Video Arcade Game Tempist for my little apartment.
-Caught MAJOR shit from Lona because now I have a huge arcade game in my
 apartment instead of her sewing table :) Just between you guys and
 me....If you know of a Ms PacMan (good condition) somewhere in the DFW
 area tell me. BUT DON'T TELL LONA! :)
-Sketched out the overall design of Quake 2 on grid paper (Gave me an
 excuse to play with my new color pencils and electric pencil sharpener).
-Played DeathMatch on a remote server, discovered lag sucks and went back
 to busting heads on ID_PUBLIC.
-Worried about how good everyone else has become, realized I could get
 beat a lot.
-Got a 3 hour Birthday massage from Brittany (Did you catch the 3 hour
 part!).
-Leaned back in my chair, put my toes on the warm window and wondered
 what Romero is doing.

OK back to business......

I will be on vacation from Sept 16 to Oct 2 in Europe.  Don't worry I'm
not flying TWA.

=======================================================
I'm doing a little experiment here. I have Cool Talk running and I want
to see how long it takes someone to connect to me.

OK, OK I got a ton of responses, my conclusion is that Cool Talk has
potential, but its just too early to say its a viable thing.


========================================================
OK I've mourned John's leaving long enough......

Things I've done today....
=========================================================
Moved from my old crusty office into Romero's office. :)
Decided to grow my hair out so I can now be the office "Rock Star"
Checked out the Hair Club for Men WWW site. http://www.hairclub.com
instead.
Cut out Romero's head from all the Wingman Warrior ads and replaced them
with my own.
Enjoyed the silence of not having to listen to Romero deathmatch.
Became the undisputed second greatest deathmatcher at id.
Admired the view from my office, but then realized I was still in Texas
and quickly became bored by it.
Discussed game ideas with the Ex-Prey team guys. Their level pack will be
cool.
Discussed game ideas with Rogue Entertainment. Their level pack will be
cool.
Discussed game ideas with Quake 2 design team. Our levels will be cooler!
=========================================================

Look for more later....

==========================================================
Timmy's things he hates about other Death Matchers!!!
-Lurkers, unless its me and American.
-Level Exiters!  Especially my levels.
-Losers who continuously discharge in the water with the lightning gun.
-People who repeatedly complain about lag.  Once is fine, I heard you the
 first time.
-Idiots with stupid characters in their names like ~;'[])($%&#@!>M<!__+|\
-People who get one frag on me and say things like, "The Id guys are not
 that tough"
-People who can't aim so they use the grenade launcher all the time
-Bone-Heads who kill me when I am holding still, looking in a corner,
 clearly typing.
-Jerks who say, "This levels sucks, lets move on"
-Dumb-Asses who try and trick us by using the name John_Romero, Remero,
 JRomero, JohnR, etc. etc.....
-People who get a negative frag count, exit, come back to start at zero
 again.
OK that's enough complaining.......
==============================================================
