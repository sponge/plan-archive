New Quake 1 map

I had an old Quake 1 map lying around so I thought I would release it.

This map was originally built for the Quake 1 arcade game, a conversion
of "The Edge" for Quake2. I added some teleporters to it in hopes of speeding up
gameplay and help prevent camping. 

For those of you who like to play Quake 1 I hope you enjoy this.

Thanks, Tim
