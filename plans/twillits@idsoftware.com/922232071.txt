Quake 3 Arena jersey update.

Action Imprints is all caught up on their first batch of orders.
They tell me the response has been great. 

If you have seen the March issue of Next Generation then you
probably noticed John Carmack wearing the very cool Quake 3 Arena jersey
in some of the pictures. The jerseys where initially created for the
folks at id. However, due to the enormous request for these jerseys,
Action Imprints, the company that created the jerseys for us, will make
them available for purchase to the general public. Further information can be found at:

Don't forget to get your jersey before Quake Con 1999!!!

New Quake 1 map

Q1edge Conversion

I had an old Quake 1 map lying around so I thought I would release it.

This map was originally built for the Quake 1 arcade game, a conversion
of "The Edge" for Quake2. I added some teleporters to it in hopes of speeding up
gameplay and help prevent camping. 

For those of you who like to play Quake 1 I hope you enjoy this.

Thanks, Tim
