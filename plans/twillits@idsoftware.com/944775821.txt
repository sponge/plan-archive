I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for the positive comments I have received 
concerning Quake 3. Every morning my inbox is full of great positive emails. I would like to 
address a couple of issues that have come up in emails.

==============================================================

Many people want to know which level designer designed which map. This is not exactly an easy 
question to answer. Unlike previous id games the designers are not separate individuals working 
on "their" maps without cooperation from anyone else. In order for a company to create truly 
great maps all the designers must learn to work together. The team of designers we have now is 
by far the best team originated group that has ever worked at id. There are no maps in Quake3 
that were developed by only one person. Some maps were touched by as many as four different 
people. Expect this design trend to continue and look forward to id creating some of the best 
maps around. 

=============================================================

I have noticed that people don't fully understand the power of our bots. The bots in Quake 3 
represent some of the most advanced bots in any game today. Our bots are capable of 
understanding and performing well over 50 different commands in the team deathmatch and CTF. 
Using combinations of commands, it's probably well over that. The in-game menu only 
represents a extremely small set of commands which bots understand. They are the BASIC 
commands. For a more complete list check out the "bot commands" document in your Quake 3 
start menu. Here are some examples of the things you can do with bots.

[Grunt and visor patrol from rl to rg for 5 mins]
Grunt and Visor will patrol from the rocket launcher to the railgun for 5 minutes.
   
Or you can group them in teams and give team commands
   
[Grunt and visor are in team beta]
[Beta defend quad forever]

Grunt and visor will team up and defend the quad for the entire game.

If you are lost have grunt help you
[grunt lead the way]
[grunt get the plasma]

Grunt will find you, and then lead you to the plasma gun. If you get out of his view he will come 
back for you.

Experiment with the commands, set up a skirmish with the bots in a team game and have some 
fun.  

Also, try chatting with the bots about anything, see what they will say. Our bots have 
approximately 200 pages of chats are responses. They might surprise you.
