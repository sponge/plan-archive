Funny story...


Monday Greg Barr and I braved a trip to the mall for lunch. On the way there we took the long 
route. Only the streets and the parking lots were shoveled. There are some 10-15 feet high piles 
of shoveled snow in the parking lots at the mall. On the way back to work from eating, we decided 
to take the short cut route by cutting behind Best Buy. There is a small patch of foliage between 
Best Buy and the buildings on the Raven side. This is the normal way we go when there is no snow. 
So we scan out a good place to cross. I tell Greg, step where I step. One step, 2 steps, 3rd step 
I am up to my chest in snow! Down I went!!! It was a riot. I was stuck!!! I turn around 
(laughing all the way) and reach out for Greg's outstretched hand. He pulls me out. We are having 
a real good laugh. After he rescued me we thought we would have to go the long way back to work. 
Only to find some tracks across the foliage some 15 feet from where we almost lost me. And crossed 
into asphalt safely. After thinking about it, we realized that where I was up to my chest in snow 
there is a drainage ditch there.

I was out braving the Heretic 2 servers over the weekend and 
would like to say hello to my fellow DeathMatchers that were roughing me up. 
They are Shaman, Sir Dog, Thug, Melevelant and Spyre. 

As a cool coincidence, Spyre is the webmaster of the first 
Soldier of Fortune site. (the project I am working on) It can be found at...

Soldier of Fortune Game Site

...and is worth a visit. So check up on some cool Soldier of Fortune news.

Until next time...

Greetings to all...

I was hitting the Heretic 2 servers from home over the weekend to play the DM maps 
that were released on Friday. There are some really good Heretic 2 
DMers out there. The maps are real cool to play. And well recieved. 
Even tho I am missing out on 1/2 the glory playing in software mode. 
I know, I should get a decent video card for my box at home.

I would like to say HI to the fellow DMers who were roughing me up,
They are Trix, Dark, Bitch, Kuebler and PoopyPants. You guys were 
really fun to play, err get slaughtered against.

So if you see someone prowling the servers as Pork Chop (a member of 
the mEat wAgon) it is me and show no mercy, I sure will not.

We here have been busy working on the Enhancement Pack for Heretic 2 and just 
released some cool screenshots of the DeathMatch levels that will be included 
in the Enhancement Pack. Here is 
a nifty screenshot of the level I made. It is called Blood Feud. And it ROCKS!!!

For those who know about Ultraman, I have set up an Ultraman Collectibles site 
of some cool Ultraman stuff that I have. Take a look at my...

Ultraman Collectibles Page

email me at smcnutt@mail.ravensoft.com and we can talk!
