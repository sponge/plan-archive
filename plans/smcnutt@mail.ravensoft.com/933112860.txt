There is a short but sweet article over on Gamecenter on Soldier of Fortune. Have a look and scope out some cool screenshots!

There is a GOD. This time in the form of Mom. (or Mum where Greg comes from)
For the past year Greg Barr, fellow Soldier of Fortune designer in the cubicle next
to mine, was wandering around with a real sorry pair of shoes. I am amazed he did not
resort to duct tape to mend them together. His Mum is here visiting and showed up to 
the offices with, yes you guessed it A NEW PAIR OF SHOES! This is a special day for 
Greg. And we are all pleased to take part in the event. Let's see how long the new pair last.
