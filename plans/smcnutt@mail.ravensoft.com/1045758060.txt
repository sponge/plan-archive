I would like to Thank everyone who has downloaded the Soldier of Fortune demo and a Thank You for posting your opinions on the SoF messageboards. We are trying out best to read through them. Comments are welcomed, but ones that simply say 'SoF sucks' do not help us when we are trying to figure why you thought it sucked. Please be more descriptive and we will try and address the issues. We have worked long and hard trying to make SoF a fun game for all and really want to hear why you did not like in more then 2 words.

Thanks again,

scott mcnutt
