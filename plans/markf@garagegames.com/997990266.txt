Well, it was a great vacation while it lasted, but all good things must come to an end... so I'm back! And what do I get to do first? Documentation... ugh. So I'm cooking up an overview doc of the V12 - and it'll probably end up being pretty big (200,000 lines of code is a fair chunk of functionality to cover :) 

We'll be putting pieces up in the SDK area as they are finished, so stay tuned.
