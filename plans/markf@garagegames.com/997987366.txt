Ah, my first GarageGames .plan update...

I'm on vacation!  After six years of working at Dynamix with some incredibly talented and cool people, I need a break - so I'm off to bum around Europe for the next three months or so.   If you need to get in contact with me, I'll be checking my GG email periodically - markf@garagegames.com (at least I will when Rick sets up the mail forwarding - hint, hint...)

Upon my return I plan on doing some R&D with Tim and Rick on some next gen networking and game simulation engine technology, but until then I'm going to try to spend as little time in front of a computer as I
can :)
