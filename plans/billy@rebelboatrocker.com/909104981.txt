This is to the gl driver writers out there...

Please check out the following glHint extension..

http://www.opengl.org/Documentation/Version1.2/EXTspecs/clip_volume_hint.txt

My data is designed in nice little units that are easily culled or accepted.
Right now I only get to take advantage of the cull. The other 90%+ of the 
data can be accepted so the driver is wasting its time attempting to clip.

Thanks.
