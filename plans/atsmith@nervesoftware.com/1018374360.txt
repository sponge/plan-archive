A few months ago my parents won a 2002 BMW Z3 Roadster.  This was all
due to the fact that they actually registered their back-up software.  Yes
this is what happens if you actually register your software :)

They arent in a position to keep it for themselves so they decided to sell it. I
thought I would help them out by posting it here.

And what's the moral to this story? 

Always register your software (yeah right).
