Happy bday #5 to Doom. The game that totally derailed my career direction from a few years ago. Which, is a good thing. I remember all the wrestling with modems and serial ports just to see the other marine turn around and shoot. The only reason I started to learn networking was just to host LAN parties. Just think, if I hadnt started playing someone else would have to bear the brunt of Natas skull bashing. 

Cheers to Doom and all the people I have met because of it.

Normally when I walk into a church, I walk out with less money. After visiting the house of G.O.D. last night, I can say it was not the case. Which is wonderful, I needed gas and movie tickets for today. 

Only in Texas can you see people ice skate to "Freebird".
