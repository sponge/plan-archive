This is the transcript of the ACTUAL radio conversation of a US naval
ship with Canadian authorities off the coast of Newfoundland.

Canadians:  Please divert your course 15 degrees to the South to
            avoid a collision.

Americans:  Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to the North
            to avoid a collision.

Canadians:  Negative.  You will have to divert your course 15 degrees
            to the South to avoid a collision.

Americans:  This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again,
            divert  YOUR course.

Canadians:  No. I say again, you divert YOUR course.

Americans:  THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS LINCOLN, THE SECOND
            LARGEST SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES' ATLANTIC FLEET.
            WE ARE ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DESTROYERS, THREE CRUISERS AND
            NUMEROUS SUPPORT VESSELS. I DEMAND THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR
            COURSE 15 DEGREES NORTH, I SAY AGAIN, THAT'S ONE FIVE
            DEGREES NORTH, OR COUNTER-MEASURES WILL BE UNDERTAKEN
            TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THIS SHIP.

Canadians:  This is a lighthouse.  Your call.
