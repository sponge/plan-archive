AAAAAAGH!  I found this game that should be banned!  It obviously MUST be the cause of ALL
the violence throughout mankind's history!  It's got two different racial groups who kill
each other whenever they come in contact.  It also teaches you that part of the key to success
is exploiting the numerous amounts of relatively powerless people, sometimes even to the point
of sacrificing their lives for sake of protecting the rich and powerful! We've got to sue
the people who made this game!  Besides, the physics sucks...  Only the knights can rocket-jump,
 and the stupid pawns can't even move backwards.
