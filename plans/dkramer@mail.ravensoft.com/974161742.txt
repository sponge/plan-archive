Random non-work related:

--First day of snow in Madison today.  Blecch...

--Anybody out there reading this (either of you) ever play a game called
Illuminati: New World Order (or INWO for those of you who are illuminated)?
It's a collectible card game kinda like magic except cool and not nearly
as expensive.  Anyway, I'm looking to buy/sell/trade some cards.  If you're
interested, let me know.

--So, D&D 3rd Edition is pretty cool.  Me like.

--I can't wait until the next MMORPG comes out.

--Charlie's Angles kicked butt.  If you don't like that movie, you're either
too high-strung or a woman.

I'm busy working on a project that I wish I could talk about, but I can't.
Sorry.
