This one's for all the other developers and people "in the know" out there:

Taken from our SOF messageboards:

Sniper342: Is that a grenade launcher with a drum magazine at the tip of the middle guy's machine gun? Does the SAW that you use in the game have a grenade launcher?

keith (Raven employee and programmer-man fantastic, Keith Fuller): I can't really say about the weapon in the artwork there...it could just be Joe's artistic license. I can tell you that the heavy machine gun in SOF comes complete with AM/FM radio, leather bucket seats, and a Willie P grenade launcher.

Sniper342: No CD player though?

LadyChaos: those better be heated leather bucket seats


*sigh*
