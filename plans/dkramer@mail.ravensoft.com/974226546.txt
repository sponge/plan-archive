Random non-work related:

--Ok, ok, John, you win.  I meant Charlie's AngLEs, dangit.  More of a typo than a
spelling error, but I concede.  It would have been a much different movie had it been 
Charlie's AngLEs.  Charlie's Paraboloids may have been closer to the mark, though.


Embarassing admission:

--I only yesterday realized why "Dubya" was such an appropriate nickname for President-
wannabe George W.  I kept wondering why Junior Bush would have a Russian nickname.
Sigh...  DUB-ya, moron, not DOOB-ya...  


Daily inflammatory comment:

--Speaking of people born with silver feet in their mouths...  The one thing I remember
hearing ad nauseum from Bush's campaign was that he trusts The People and that Gore trusts
The Government.  I guess that doesn't apply, though, when it comes to counting votes, eh,
Georgie?


Work-related snippit:

--We'll be putting up an SOF 1.07 server here sometime in the near future.  More details
as events warrant.
