6 months since last update.  woo.

Completely non-SoF2 related, so if you're planning on whining
to me about my .plan file not containing any secret information
about SoF2, get stuffed:

I'm looking for an old, out-of-print boardgame called Grand Imperialism.
It was made by a now-defunct company called Gametime Games back in 1978.
If anybody has this game and would be willing to sell it, or knows of
somebody else who would, PLEASE, send me an email.
