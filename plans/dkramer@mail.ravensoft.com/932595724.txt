I am a happy camper!  I've just spent the past half an hour watching the first "real" game of
 deathmatch in SOF.  Though it's in its infant stages, everybody here seems to be having a lot
of fun with the game.  It's fast and VERY lethal...  and a bit disturbing since my voice was used
as a filler for some of the death screams.  Good stuff!

Though I did some editor work on Heretic II, this is the first project I've ever been on since
the very beginning.  It really feels good to see your hard work in action!
