Big Exciting News Announcement!!

Today is my last day at Raven Software.  *gasp*  I'll still be reachable at
dkramer@ravensoft.com for the near future, and I'm trying to transfer
my work ICQ to my home ICQ so I can keep in touch with everybody.

I've been here four years and seven months to the day.  Thanks and best
wishes to everybody I've worked with, chatted with, shot at, been shot
by, etc. along the way.  There are too many of you to list individually,
so I hope you'll accept one huge blanket expression of gratitude.

I'm proud to have been a part of the development of the Hexen II Mission
Pack, Heretic II, Soldier of Fortune, Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force,
Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, and Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix.
It's great to be able to look back over the past five years and feel a
real sense of accomplishment.  

Well, I hate long goodbyes, and I'm already pushing this one.  So, if you'd
like to drop in and give me a good luck bullet between the eyes, I'm often
playing SoF2 on the "-=SoF=- MadTown DS3" server at 216.138.176.192.  I play
as -=SoF=- grump, and I'd be more than happy to stand still long enough for
ya -- as long as you don't use those wussy M203 n00b 'nades.  I hate those ;)
