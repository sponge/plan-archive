	Wow, we've just finished getting the last frag-crazed gamer out the door.  I've certainly learned a thing or two tonight.  The next time we do something like this, we will do it on a sign-up basis.  We didn't expect to have nearly as many people show up as did, and unfortunately, the "first come, first serve" clause that I put in my SOF messageboard post had to be enacted.  I sincerely hope that if you were one of the people who didn't get in, that you'll give us a chance to do it right in the future.  The whole idea of opening up the Sunday night testing was sort of thrown together at the last minute on Friday (hence the weird time), and we (well, actually, I) weren't prepared for the overwhelming response.  It seems that my little ol' post made its way from the SOF messageboard to the major gaming sites.
	A big thanks to those who helped us test.  It seemed to me like you enjoyed it, and your suggestions afterwards were helpful.  The positive responses were gratifying, and the criticisms will help us make a better game for you.
