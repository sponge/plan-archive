Thanks to video games, I'm an expert at many cool things!

I'm an expert marksman (thanks to first person shooters), I can also fly the space shuttle 
(thanks to Asteroids, Lunar Lander, Stargunner, Raptor, Terminal Velocity, many others), I 
can fly any aircraft (various flight simulators), run a small or large city (various Sim City 
games and sequels), beat up anyone in a one-on-one fight (Mortal Kombat, Virtua Fighter, 
Street Fighter, Tekken), manage an army in a war (various war games and real-time strategy 
games), lay bricks in any pattern as good as the best brick layers in the world (Tetris) and 
even play any major league sport alongside any of the pros! 

I owe it all to video & computer games!

One of the best game violence articles I've read:

www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/06/21/game_violence/index.html

========================================
The Day After:

Absolutely loved The Phantom Menace, EXCEPT for that entirely annoying Jar Jar character.  
What a complete and utter mistake to have that character in the movie.  Please, Lucas, let 
me review the next movie's script so that I can weed out mistakes like this and save you 
much embarrassment.

All of 3D Realms people who went to see the movie last night wore tee shirts we made that 
said "Jar Jar Must Die" and showed a picture of Jar Jar's head being lopped off with a light 
saber.  Dozens of people at the theater asked us were they could get the shirt.  Pictures of 
us in line wearing these shirts will be on our web site soon.

We're also going to open a movie review site, 3D Realms' style, at www.MovieSuckage.com, 
which will have short articles by 3D Realms people about major movies that unfortunately 
include utterly dumb things.  Message boards will be available for everyone to make their 
comments, too.  Should be fun.

I really hope LucasArts is smart enough to not make any games involving Jar Jar -- he's the 
new metaphor for failure.  Trespasser is now off the hook.

Today I read one of the least intelligent remarks I've ever seen by a game developer, and
shockingly it came from a game designer I and others respect enormously, Shigeru Miyamoto,
most famous for Donkey Kong, the Mario Bros. series, and the Zelda series of games.

In the April 1, 1999 print issue of GamesBusiness (www.gamesbusiness.com) Miyamoto is
asked about the improved 3D graphics abilities of the coming PlayStation 2, and he replies
with a question:  "Will the improvement in hardware quality actually improve the quality of the
gameplay experience?"

Well, duh, yes!

Is Miyamoto really questioning whether advances in graphics open doors to advances in
gameplay?!

His own Mario and Zelda games on the N64 answer that question without any doubt.  Zelda
on the N64 is light years ahead of any previous Zelda, in terms of look and gameplay and total
experience.  Better graphics unquestionably give game developers more gameplay options.
(That's not to say that all developers take advantage of this fact, but that's an entirely
different issue!)

So why would he ask such a question?  Perhaps he's really just taking a dig at the PSX2
incredible specifications.  This is likely, because in that same article he says of those
specifications:  "Never trust what hardware manufacturers say."  Well, if we take his
experienced advice, then we should also be very skeptical of whatever specs Nintendo
releases for their next generation system too!  ; )

========================================
Update (4-2-1999):

Okay, most people didn't bite on this, BUT most people (over 100+ emails) thought it would be
a great idea!

April Fools Update:

The Phantom Menace:  Cool news...

One of the producers working on the Duke Nukem movie has seen a pre-screening of the
coming Star Wars epic, and told me about something too cool to not reveal (look the other 
way if you do not want to spoil a big surprise):

Harrison Ford has a cameo, playing none other than Han Solo's father!  We get to see the 
building of the Millenium Falcon, Han's father's ship (who names it during the movie).  I also 
heard that it's planned in the next movie that the ship ends up in Lando's possession, and in 
the third movie it's back in Han's possession.

Too cool!

This part is for real:  I just hope that The Phantom Menace isn't Muppets in Space, like the
previews sadly suggest.  Man, George, just get rid of the silly kid marketing stuff and make a
hard core, kick butt sci-fi movie like the first two Star Wars were.

Got this via email.  If anyone needs game ideas, we now have a source!!!

----------

Hello,

My name is [name withheld] and I own a game ideas development company.  I would like to co-operate
with you.  If you don't understand what we do here, I will explain.  What we do here in Creative Gamers
is create Game Ideas.  We create the game idea and then sell the rights to Game DEVELOPMENT
company's.  We sell 2 things in our company:
1) A game idea with some specific details - Low Price.
2) Create a full draft of a game, charachters, background, story and everything - Price varies according
to length of the game.
We want to work with you.  We produce ANY KIND of game in a very short time, the
longest time it took us to create a full draft for a game was 3 weeks and that was a 2 cd game.

Thank you very much.

P.S.  Please reply if you want more information like full price list or just a specific type of game, or just a
Yes or No.

I was just asked via email by one of the key producers behind the Duke Nukem movie what I
thought of Wing Commander.  Here's the answer I sent to that person:

"I saw it, and it rates as a good Saturday morning kid show script -- except
that it even bored my two kids! The special effects were good enough, but
the story and dialogue was embarrassing. There are so many easily fixable
problems with this movie it's just a real shame. This movie makes the
endless stupidity in Stormship Troopers look good!"

I could elaborate further about the dumbness of this movie, but it's best to forget the nightmare
and focus on the coming space movie that really matters...

Happy New Year to my family (Chana, Shane & Jace) and Everyone Worldwide!

Finished playing Heretic 2 today.  Very highly recommended!

I then tried to play Tomb Raider 3 and there's no way I can do it.  TR3's control method is so
 inferior to that of Heretic 2's (both are 3rd-person games) that I cannot regress that far--TR3 is 
far too frustrating to control.  The camera in TR3 rarely points the direction I want it to (i.e. the 
direction that Lara Croft is facing!!!), looking up and down is a complete chore, and the fact that 
TR3 doesn't support mouse control is an oversight of epic magnitude.  Max Payne's 3rd-person 
control will NOT be as horrible as TR3's, that I can promise!

Bottom line:  This game is more of a control issue than one of enjoying the actual gameplay, and 
for me that's not fun.

And finally, when will the graphics engine in the Tomb Raider series catch up to 1996 standards, 
let alone today's standards!  Sheesh, nothing is worse that looking at headache inducing 
misaligned textures.

Well, now that I'm giving up on TR3, looks like I get to finish Half-Life earlier than planned.  ; )

The above link points to a story about Gathering of Developers on Upside Today, a nice daily news 
site.

The story contains this paragraph:  >>>Ironically, the industry's largest third-party game 
producer, Electronic Arts, started with the same Hollywood studio/independent creator model that 
GOD now preaches. "EA started with the same philosophy as GOD," says legendary developer Sid 
Meier, who runs Hunt Valley, Md.-based Firaxis Inc., which has a deal to make games that EA will 
publish.<<<

I've heard this misconception about Gathering several times.  Here's why it's wrong:  Gathering has 
a board of directors comprised of mostly developers.  The purpose of this developer-oriented board  
is to insure that Gathering does not become a publisher in which developer issues and concerns 
become secondplace priorities.

No other publisher has a board of directors comprised of developers that is setting company policy 
and vision.  Already several times this board has made policies and decisions that are in favor of 
developers, where at other publishers these decisions would have gone in favor other the 
corporation.

EA did not have a developer oriented board of directors to make sure their developer-oriented 
vision stayed in place, and that's why Gathering will succeed as a developer-oriented publisher 
where others have failed.

In the same article, Richard Hilleman, a VP at EA, says, "The more things change, the more they 
stay the same."  Hilleman is of course as wrong as Meier.  A publisher like the Gathering of 
Developers has been never attempted before, with proven developers helping to run the company
and maintain developer priorities.  With the Gathering it's the first time it's not Developers vs Suits, 
because the developers in this case are the suits.

The current PC Gamer and other recent magazine editions have run articles listing the best 50 or 
100 games of all time.  My concern is that these lists often don't include older, groundbreaking 
games.  For example, should not a game like Wolfenstein 3-D be included because it kicked-off the 
3D first-person shooter genre?  Should not Myst be a lock because it's the best selling game of all 
time, and therefore the most popular game in PC history?  And how can any such list omit 
revolutionary and great games like M.U.L.E., and Wing Commander, and Tetris?!

Any Best Games Ever list without these games can't be a Best Games Ever list.

Wolfenstein 3-D is outdated and surpassed by six years of technically better 3D shooters.  Same 
with the other games listed above.  And that's the problem with these lists:  They often don't take 
into account how influential and innovative a game was for its time.  Instead, these lists mostly 
comprise themselves with games released in the past few years.  Do lists of the Best Novels Ever 
or Best Movies Ever only contain recent titles?  Absolutely not.

This is why I prefer Computer Gaming World magazine's Hall of Fame over lists of the Best Games 
Ever.  A Hall of Fame ignores games that are current hits and recognizes games that stand the 
test of time, impact the industry and influence their genre.  Best Games Ever lists contain too 
many games that come and go, but once a game makes the Hall of Fame list, it's there forever, 
and for good reason.

I'm not sure who would manage it, but I'd like to see an industry sanctioned Hall of Fame.  The 
SPA (Software Publishers Association) seems like an obvious choice to handle this, except they've 
shown themselves to be utterly inept with their annual Codie Awards, an industry farce that 
should be put to death like an annoying mosquito.

Unless something more official is formed, the CGW Hall of Fame will likely remain the best listing of 
our industry's best games, especially from a historical perspective.

========================================
July 8, 1998

A few people have reminded me that many months ago I said that I'd write about
the negative effects that realistic and improved graphics have had on the game
industry.  I guess it's time to pontificate.  Who knows, I might even have a
valid point or two--sometimes I get lucky that way.

Let's get this straight:  Everyone loves the improved graphics we're seeing in
today's games.  The key problem is that too often developers focus on graphics
and lose focus gameplay issues.

This is why most FMV (full motion video) games fell flat on their pompous
faces.  This is why the convergence of Hollywood and Silicon Valley won't
revolutionize the game industry.  This is why Rocket Science never had a
chance.

Spin the date dial back to the late 70's and early 80's, when graphics were
1-bit, we're talking black and white, but included masterworks like Asteroids,
Space Invaders, Space War, Battlezone, and Pong.  Other 1-bit games used
colored plastic overlays on the monitor itself, like Star Castle, Armor
Attack, and Warlords, and on some machines those overlays even lined up
correctly.

But you know what, as unrealistic as those graphics were, those games were
addictively fun.  Later games like Pac Man, Galaxian, Missile Command,
Tempest, Defender, and Centipede graduated to 2-bit (4 color), and even 4-bit
(16 color) graphics.  But still, the graphics weren't the selling point--it
was still the balanced, polished gameplay.  Designers back then for the most
part designed their games with gameplay in mind first, and the graphics were
simply a medium to bring their game to life.  Look how these older games have
been fondly remembered over the years.  There's a single, solid reason for
that:  Gameplay.

Nowadays, with graphics standards escalating on nearly a monthly basis, it's
tough for developers to focus long and hard on the juicy meat of game design. 
Imagine what the game chess might be like if the game designers had focused
too much attention on the quality of the wooden or stone pieces, and the
detail and shape of the pieces (polygon count?).  I can't imagine that these
were important considerations when the game of chess evolved, meaning chess'
gameplay (game rules and the interaction of the pieces) mattered most and
could be polished without competing distractions.

However, game players like to see something that looks better than they've
seen before.  That's what puts the pressure on developers to focus on better
graphics, and that deducts time from gameplay balance and polishing.

Perhaps the real enemy of gameplay is advancing technology, such as faster
CPUs and new 3D accelerated cards.  If we could freeze hardware technology for
five years, then all developers could stop competing so hard on the graphics
front and once again give due attention to gameplay concerns.  We might even
have more time to think of a few more original games, since we wouldn't have
the crutch of just doing what's been done before but with a better graphics
engine.

I think gameplay is the victim of advancing technology, which favors
advancements in graphics over advancements in game design.  It's a rare
development team that can overcome the seduction of advancing technology and
give gameplay issues proper focus.  Every developers' first step in this
direction is to be aware of the problem...

Geoff Keighley, editor of GameSlice, wrote an interesting article on shareware
games today:

http://www.gameslice.com/editorial/0622share.shtml

In it, he asks  "Why aren’t there any new shareware companies or any exciting
new shareware games being released?"

Having been involved in the shareware industry since 1986, often in key ways,
I think I can answer this question.

Nowadays, it more often than not takes 10 to 20 person teams to make
competitive games.  It used to be much different, and not all that long ago. 
For example, in the early years of Apogee's existence, up until 1993, it was
normal for a shareware development team to have only 3 to 5 developers, and in
some cases these developers had day jobs, too.

The original Duke Nukem (a platform style game, technically superior to
anything comparable), released in mid-1991, was created by two full-time
developers (Todd Replogle and Allen Blum), plus a few people who contributed
bits and pieces (including me--I designed all the levels in the shareware
episode and did most of the game's sound effects).  This game sold 1500 copies
a month for nearly a year, at $30 a pop, with no middleman retailer or
publisher.  Apogee was grossing $45,000 a month on a game that took six months
and maybe $20,000 total to make.  Todd made a significant portion of that.

Shareware in those days was a gold mine because there wasn't much competition,
even from the retail market, where maybe 40 to 80 games were released a
year--not the 1200+ that are released in recent years.

The stakes are so much higher now that the game industry is so competitive.  I
can't see that any small, unfunded shareware team has much of a chance unless
that team breaks into a new area or opens up a new genre.  Even Wolfenstein
3-D needed heavy funding from Apogee to get done.  id Software had to be
guaranteed a significant five-figure advance before they agreed to do the
game.  In hindsight that advance was insignificant, considering what the game
made for both companies!

Lots of people think Wolfenstein 3-D came out of nowhere to blow away the
industry, but that was not the case.  By that time id was a professionally run
company with several successful Commander Keen games behind them, and they had
an incredible work ethic from their days working in the sweat shop known as
Softdisk, cranking out a quality game a month (one of those games being the
precursor to Wolfenstein 3-D, a 3D EGA title, Catacombs 3-D.)

Geoff asks, "Shareware, where are you?"  The answer is not that shareware has
changed, the answer is that the entire game industry has become
hyper-competitive, and this makes it very tough for small, unfunded teams to
surprise the world with something that stands out.  It's sad, but it's the
price of progress.

Resume Writing Tips for the Game Industry and Beyond:

I see maybe 150 resumes each year.  Most contain too much information and the
wrong emphasis on what's important.  In the past few months many people have
asked me to review their resume and offer tips, so I've written this "standard
reply" to use in the future, which I'll share here.

[1]  Don't exceed a page in length.  Not even Albert Einstein, Benjamin
Franklin or Thomas Edison have the credentials to exceed one page.  In fact,
the longer your resume, the more it looks like you're trying to hide the fact
that you don't have much going for you.  Short, concise resumes are those that
actually get read.

[2]  Include all forms of contact information, including address, phone, fax
and email.  Make yourself easy to reach.

[3]  The first section is titled "Objective."  Make this one or two sentences,
absolutely no more.  Do not write a me-oriented objective ("I'm looking for
position that exploits my design strengths, furthers my growth, and has real
opportunities for advancement.")  Instead, write a company oriented objective
that shows you're team and goal oriented ("I'm a team player looking to help
develop innovative games that achieve the company's vision and design goals.")
Short and sweet works best here.

[4]  Next, in bullet point form, list three to five highlights, each one
physical line long.  This is the area in which you really sell yourself! 
Readers typically look here first because it summarizes your achievements and
value.  Einstein, for example, might mention these things:

*  Wrote Special Theory of Relativity, disproving several of Newton's laws
*  Showed how mass and energy were equivalent (E=MC^2)
*  Received the Nobel Prize in 1921
*  Predicted existence of black holes 50 years before being detected
*  Involved with the creation of atomic bomb

[5]  After this, briefly mention your work history, but only as it pertains to
the job you're going after.  Don't mention unrelated positions that don't help
your cause.  Instead, say that you can provide an extensive work history upon
request.  Don't bother putting down that you flipped hamburgers or bagged
grociers (unless you're appying for a job in those industries).

[6]  In the education section, don't mention high school, only college and
other related training.  Once again, you can mention that a more complete
education history is available on request.

For programmers, do not list every language and operating system under the
sun, which makes you look like a jack of all trades but a master of none. 
You're much better off listing one or two languages as your "expertise," and
if you know more say you're also "familiar with the following languages." 
Another key point is that most companies and developers prefer to hire
specialists, not generalists, so try to position yourself as a graphics
specialist, 3D engine specialist, AI specialist, network/Internet specialist,
etc.

For artists, coders, musicians, etc., you might want to say that samples and
demos are available on request.

[7]  Regarding references, go ahead a list two or three, and if you have more
say they're available on request.

[8]  The last piece of the puzzle is often overlooked:  the cover letter. 
This is where you specifically mention why you want to work for the company,
and why you like the company.  This is a great place to brown nose a little by
specifically mentioning company products and what you like about the company's
vision, etc.  Prospective employers love to think you are applying to their
company because you have a passion for the company.  Keep this letter to one
page, don't be too wordy, and maintain professionalism.

Best of luck.

========================================
March 27, 1998

I've gotten a very good response to my recent plans about gameplay and the old
days of the arcade industry, and I've been asked to continue with similar
updates.

First, so you know where I'm coming from, I started playing arcade games in
1976, at the age of 15, but it wasn't until Space Invaders came out that I
become a hopeless addict, spending my last quarter playing arcade games.  This
led to several jobs working at arcades in the early 80's, when the industry
was booming and there were arcades on every corner like there are McDonald's
today (this was the pre-Chicken McNugget's era).

I met my future Apogee partner, George Broussard, in high school in 1978,
where we both hung out in the computer room with a teletype time-share system,
and an Apple II.  We became friends and ended up working at the same arcades
in the early 80's.

George and I became top experts at many arcade games, and even entered several
tournaments.  In one of the biggest Dallas-area tournaments, George took first
place and I got second, out of over 100 competitors.

In those days a top players would often carry around a sheet of paper with
their best scores written down for all the games they were good at.  I've
still got my old papers somewhere.  We'd bump into other champion class
players and compare scores.  George and I would usually have the better
scores, so it occurred to us that we should start an official league of top
game players, and have an official high score database (too bad the Web wasn't
around back then--it would have made it easy for us to do this).

In '82, we formed the NVGPA (National Video Game Players Assoc.), and we were
writing a newsletter, but then the opportunity came for us to write a strategy
book on how to beat the top arcade games of the day, so we pursued that. too. 
We really thought the book was going to make us rich.  I remember running the
book's potential sale's figures though my mind:  In each of the top 250 cities
there must be a least an average of 10,000 game players, and if just 100 of
them bought our book that would be 25,000 sales, plus in all the remaining
cities we should count on at least 5 more books sold in each, which should add
another 25,000 sales.  And with each sale george and I get $1 each.  Wow,
that's more money than we can make in 5 real years of work--we'd be rich!

But in the six months it took us to write our book about 20 others came out,
and ours didn't make a dent.  I think less than 1000 sold, and that didn't
even cover the printing expenses.  We saw not a penny for our work.

However, I used the book to get a job as a weekly columnist at the Dallas
Morning News, where I wrote for four years about arcade, home video, and
computer games.  And this in turn opened the door to write about 100 articles
and reviews for the top national gaming magazines during the 80's, such as
COMPUTE!, one of the biggest general computing mags of it's time.

George and I, during the mid- and late-80's kept buying all the new computers
(IBM PC, PET, C-64, Amiga, etc) and we continued to code our own games, and
even sell them to small publishers, like Keypunch Software (run by the same
guy who nows runs WizardsWorks, a division of GT Interactive--small world!).

These early years taught us a lot about games, gameplay and gave us a good
"shit filter" about what ideas should make it into a game, and which
shouldn't.  I think of all those 1000's of dollars I spent on games back then
as tuition to video game college, which I'm now cashing in on.

That's a brief background check.  Soon, I'll write about the negative effects
that realistic graphics have had on the game industry.
