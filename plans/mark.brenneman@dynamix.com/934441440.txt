Well well...we finally shipped the BGE(best game ever).  Now maybe Chaos(MW) will be too
busy playing TRIBES that he will stop whining about that one summer that he actually had to
work...Wha..Wha. But seriously folks.  I am very pleased that most of you out there 
are loving the game. We put our hearts into it and have even better things in store for TRIBES2.
Going to take a vacation in March and come back with a great tan and ready for action Baybay!

see ya!
