Project:
Unreal Tournament
Plan:


 2 pinches pure arsenic
 1 pinch of belladonna
 1 measure fresh phase spider venom (under 30 days old)
 1 measure fresh wyvern venom (under 60 days old)
 1 cup of the blood of a dead infant killed by a phase spider
 1 cup of the blood of a dead infant killed by
    a mixture of arsenic and belladonna
 1 heart of a virgin human killed by a wyvern
 1 quart of blood from a vampire
 7 reproductive glands from a giant moth (dead for less than 60 days)

Mix in the order given by the light of the full moon.  Simmer well.
Upon drinking the concoction you will sleep into a deep coma,
after awaking, enjoy your new life as a Lich.

I bought a searchable library of issues 1 to 250 of Dragon Magazine.
Some kick ass stuff in there!
