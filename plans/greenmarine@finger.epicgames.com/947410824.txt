Damn its a small world.

I bought Dragon Mountain an AD&D campaign and there is cover art by
Paul Jaquays.  Cool!  I have two signed Rifts prints on my wall
of my office by Kevin Long and I find out from Steve Garofalo that
he works at Raven.  Cool!

I grew up on Rifts, Kevin Long's art is kick ass.

Hey Paul! If you read this, post a list of all the modules you did
art for.  I want to find some of them.
