A 413 for Linux is in testing with a few of our server operators from
the UTServers mailing list.  This version of 413 does not include any
code from OpenUT.  I will probably release this patch in delta compressed
and non-compressed format.

I am going to talk to Daniel Vogel about releasing an OpenUT enhanced
413 afterwards.  I was integrating the CVS features, but I can't test
them all and I am running short on time.  The programmers who have
contributed to OpenUT have gotten a LOT of stuff in great shape.

They've added support for music, a much less cpu intensive mixing scheme,
support for control through SDL, support for MesaGL through SDL, and lots
of stability features.  All of this code is available through the OpenUT
website, openut.sourceforge.net.

There will also be a new public source distribution to follow the 413
Linux release.
