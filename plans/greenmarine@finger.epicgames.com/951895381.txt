During the EverQuest beta I gave it a try and railed on it afterwards
because I lost a level when I died.  I swore never to play it again.
Cliff bought a copy of it a while back to check it out, so I've been
playing with it.  I built up a level 7 Dwarf Paladin.

So I'm running around killing mobs and crap and I die and stuff.
Last night I died and went to recover my corpse.  After I pick up
all my equipment, my client crashes.  I reconnect and all my stuff
and my corpse is gone.  So I'm told I have to send EMAIL to some dude
at Verant or something.  Poof goes the EverQuest account.  What a waste.

There has to be some fucking accountability in the Massively Multiplayer
scene.  These companies need to stop shipping games full of show stopping
bugs like this.  I would classify a bug that takes away all your
possessions as a class A "programming team stop what you are doing and fix
it bug".  UO had a million and one bugs like this.  To its credit,
EverQuest has had few.

Fear from Battle Vortex taught me the numero uno key rule to playing
massively multiplayer games: Never EVER become attached to your possessions.
I think that rule is a good one to follow when it comes to losing
your possessions naturally...but game bugs?

I've got a serious problem with games that require hours upon hours of
your time only to take away the things you have earned.  Whether its
the levels you've gained or the items you carry.  Whether its through
game design decisions or through bugs.
