Subject: New office rule.

It's called, no deadly zulu weapons for christ sakes.  Come on guys, that's
just dumb, those things are radically more dangerous than a BB gun.  If you
shot someone in the neck with one of those things accidentally, you would
fucking kill the dude!  Please get them out of here and don't bring them
back.  There is absolutely no reason to be shooting 12-inch long 100 MPH
needles in the damn office.

This was sent to our internal team discussion list :)  But not before
we punched a few holes in the wall in Cliff's office.  Rock!
