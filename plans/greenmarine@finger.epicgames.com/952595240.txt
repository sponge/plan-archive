Thursday, March 09, 2000

I'm off to CGDC.  I'll be there seeing a few of the speeches I'm
interested in, but mostly I'll be demonstrating new Epic technology
to other game companies.  We will not be giving out any screenshots 
to the public or the media.

If your company is interested in looking at some kickass terrain
technology for your next game (massively multiplayer game?  roleplaying game?
shooter?  RTS?) then look up the Epic booth and check our stuff out.

We'll also be showing our PS2 work, an extremely advanced skeletal
animation system, and the new editor developed by Legend Entertainment.
