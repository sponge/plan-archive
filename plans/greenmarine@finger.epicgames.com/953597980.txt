Unreal Tournament server-authoritative netcode is that way for a reason.
The author of Zero Ping seems to think that we didn't know what we were
doing when we wrote it. :)

Zero Ping might make a game feel more responsive, but it seriously opens
up servers for client side exploitation.  Security is a critical part
of online gaming and multiplayer fairness.

Even though Zero Ping makes the game feel more responsive to the
shooter, it detriments the victim.  You might think you got out of the way...
hell the server might even agree that you DID get out of the way...but
Zero Ping ignores that and empowers the client's machine to make critical
gameplay decisions.

I encourage mod authors to avoid using the Zero Ping Unreal Tournament mod.
Finally, realize that ngWorldStats will reject stats reports from servers
using the Zero Ping mod.
