After dinner today James, Erik and I were talking about Bed, Bath
and Beyond.  We got on the subject of decorating new apartments.

I said that having a girlfriend to decorate would be nice.  I said
girlfriends are a lot like perl scripts...with a little tweaking
you can automate large parts of your life.

Erik said girlfriends are more like Linux.  You have to rebuild
the kernel to get things working right and then you have a lot
of maintenence to keep things going well.  :)
