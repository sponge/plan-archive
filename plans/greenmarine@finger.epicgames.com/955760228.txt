Rocket Arena for Unreal Tournament has been released at my Rocket Arena
site: http://www.planetunreal.com/arena/

So go get it!  There is information about the mod on the site, so I won't
repeat it here.  I've had fun working on the mod, but now I've got to
turn back onto Epic stuff.  Mike 'Mongo' Lambert is going to take over
the project (he's kick ass.)

I've got the Linux patch put together and need to release that tonight too,
but I'll go get some food first.  Dan Vogel has integrated all the OpenUT
stuff so I'll talk about that later.

I have been playing a bit of Thief 2.  Its great!  I'll play it more
when I get my new home machine.  The one I've got now is messed up.
