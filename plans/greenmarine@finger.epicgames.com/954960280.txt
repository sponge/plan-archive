Unreal Tournament
Plan:
Instead of bitching like a baby, I'll post some links to information.

http://www.planetunreal.com/mutation/
The Mutation Device - A really good site with basic tutorials on mod
authoring, specifically mutators.

http://www.planetunreal.com/modcentral/
Mod Central Unreal - An excellent site with information and links to
mod sites and mod design.  Good overall mod news.

http://unreal.epicgames.com/
The Unreal Tech site.  There are some good docs under Programming for
UnrealScripters.  Some of the docs I wrote need updated now and have
some typos (yuck!)

http://www.planetshane.com/
Shane Caudle's model site was here, but it seems to be broken at the
moment.  It used to be at www.scott.net/~shane  I'll ask him about it
later.

The biggest resources for level designers can be found among the older
Unreal level design tutorials.  A lot of those older tutorials are still
completely relevant to Unreal Tournament level design.  Planet Unreal
and Unreality both have sets of tutorials.

Finally, for mailing lists, check out the UnrealScript list at www.egroups.com
Epic runs a UTMods list for the same kind of discussion (but more general
to any mod type topic) that is open to the public.  Just email me your
address and I'll add you to the list.

And Cliff wanted me to mention his Ownage site.  Its his own reward system
for map authors that impress him.  He's expanded the site to cover just
about any project now.
