Hello again, I was just reading the mailbag on BluesNews and I ran across the post about Veterans Day and it got me thinking... 

All of those men and women who gave their lives for this country, all of the men and women who dedicated themselves for us..

I'm going to go ahead and take that advice and say "Thank you" to all of those men and women who dedicated so much so that we could live our lives today.
