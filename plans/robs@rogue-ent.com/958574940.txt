Wow, it's been awhile since I've updated. Since E3 I've been reading the webpages like crazy trying to find any sort of reactions to Alice and I must say I am very happy with what I've found. I know Jim said this a few days back in his .plan, but I am totally excited by what I am reading from everyone who saw Alice at E3. It is SO great to see so many people happy with our product, and the team is looking forward to making this game the best game we can for all of you out there. With that said I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who took the time out to see Alice and review it at E3, it really helps give us a feel for if we are going in the right direction.

If you have no idea what E3 coverage I am talking about then you can go to "Dark Places" at  http://alice.stomped.com and get links to all of the Alice E3 coverage, as well as interviews and screenshots from the team. 

I'd also like to thank the crew over at Dark Places for supporting us since day one, and also for finding another Alice fan site. You can check out AliceTyme over at http://www.tymesway.com/alice/ and give them some support as well.



Well, thats enough for me for one day. Bye!
