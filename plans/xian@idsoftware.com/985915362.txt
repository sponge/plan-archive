<u>How wired are you ?</u>

 I've created a poll on The Shugashack to gauge personal curiosity as to 
how wired gamers are out there. While I realize this is hardly accurate, it
should give a good "rough idea".

 The gist of it is, I'm trying to see, roughly, how many gamers out there
have a permanent connection to the internet, despite the fact that whichever
game you are playing, doesn't need a connection to the net.

 If you have a moment to spare, please take all of 13.2 seconds to participate
in this poll.

 Thank you.
