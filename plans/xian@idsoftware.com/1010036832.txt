 *sigh* Looks like both servers mentioned below are down... I'll look
into it in the morning when I get into the office.

 Effective midnight tonight, my popular xian-osx.idsoftware.com WolfMP
server will be going down. It is being moved to xian-gameserver.idsoftware.com.

192.246.40.45:27960	mp_destruction !!!
192.246.40.45:27961	Stopwatch Mapcycle

 The server is currently running the WolfMP 1.1 binaries (Thanks Brandon!) 
which should hopefully be released in the near future. The 1.1 server works 
just dandy with v1.0 retail clients !

 So, for all you guys that frequent the xian-osx.idsoftware.com server, I would
greatly appreciate it if you all moved to the new server (which has has it's
maxclients raised higher than was set on xian-osx...)

 If you encounter any problems with any of the Wolf servers I run (denoted by
"[id] Xian's *" in the server browser), please don't hesitate to drop me a line
at xian@idsoftware.com. They should all be running the v1.1 server binaries, and
I would be interested in hearing about any bugs or issues you encounter while
playing.

 Also, if people could test out playing on port 27961, this should have the 
"zombie clients not disconnecting" bug fixed as well.

 Cheers,

 -Xian
