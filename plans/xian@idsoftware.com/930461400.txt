 I moved over the web and ftp services over to a new machine Saturday afternoon
and changed the DNS entries appropriately. If anyone is having problems connecting
to our site, it's probably because the root DNS servers haven't recieved our changes
yet. Things should straighten themselves out within the next 24 hours hopefully.

 The new IP's are;

 192.246.40.185 == www.idsoftware.com / ftp.idsoftware.com
 192.246.40.142 == www.quake3arena.com / www.quakearena.com
 192.246.40.35  == www.glsetup.com

 And yes, for those reading between the lines, I moved over to a new server in order
to prepare for our next test release (No, I don't have a date other than "soon".)
Our old server got completely hammered last release, so we went and got a beefier
machine just to house web and ftp traffic.
