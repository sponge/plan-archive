 An interesting quote on a webpage I don't feel like linking, in response to 
my .plan update last night.

This is the second time a member of id Software has expressed that they 
are bored with plain Vanilla Deathmatch. "Hello, McFly!" why didn't you 
put something more than Vanilla Deathmatch In the game box.

 Since when does pleasant change equate to bored with Deathmatch ?

 Before people go about putting words in my mouth publicly, and making
assumptions, at least do me the courtesy of asking for clarification.

 In my not-so-humble opinion, deathmatch kicks ass. It's an adrenaline rush,
great fun, and I enjoy it immensely.

 One of the great strengths of the Quake III engine is it's extensibility, and
it's always a treat to see what the community comes up with by playing a well 
made and fun mod like Q3Fortress.

 Well damn. I just finished playing about an hour and a half's worth of
Q3Fortress and boy is it ever a pleasant change of pace from frantic 
deathmatch. Much much fun was had. I definately love the sniper =P

 If you haven't played it yet, by all means, check it;

 Props to the team. I'm looking forward to the finished product.
