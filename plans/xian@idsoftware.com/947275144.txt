<u>Connectivity Problems with Q3A</u>

 To be blunt, we are currently the target of a major denial of service attack 
which was started at 3pm CST this afternoon.

 The perpetrators of this denial of service are saturating two full DS3's coming
into Dallas, and are affecting all Savvis, UUNet, and Sprint connections locally.

 To combat this attack, Savvis, UUNet, and Sprint have implemented access filters
blocking certain traffic to our entire class C, and are blocking our DNS server
entirely.

 Savvis will be monitoring the situation throughout the evening, and I'm expecting
a wakeup call at 8am from the morning tech crew at Savvis for an update. I will be
calling the FBI in the morning to proceed legally on this attack.

 I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this is causing you. Believe me,
we are as frustrated as you are.
