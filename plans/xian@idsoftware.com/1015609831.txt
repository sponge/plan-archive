 For those of you who frequent our game servers, I've now set up 
a message board, so that you can all talk after the game, trade
tips, talk smack, etc...

 It's available off the Server Stats page at;

<a href="http://underworld.idsoftware.com/wolf">http://underworld.idsoftware.com/wolf</a>

 Well, doesn't look like the large 64 player server was very popular, 
so in it's place, I've now set up a MP_BEACH server at;

 gameserver2.idsoftware.com (192.246.40.64)
 [id] Xian's MP_BEACH Server

 Check it if you are a regular on any of our servers. If it becomes
popular, I'll start keeping stats for it.

 Maxlives are in full effect.
