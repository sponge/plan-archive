 <i>Programming stuff...</i>

 Under Windows NT Server, there is a utility called Server Manager, which 
brings up a list of all files currently open on the server, and it allows
you to close those files/resources.

 We're looking to do this ourselves for an in house app, so if anyone can
point me in the direction of what API calls to use to get that list, how to
close those open files/resources, or any sample code to accomplish this, I'd
greatly appreciate it.

 Thanks,

 -Xian
