 A user wrote in and recommended <a href="http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp.html">ucspi-tcp</a> as 
a solution for limiting the number of connections to the ftpd under OpenBSD.

 Due to the nature of how ucspi-tcp works, and the reputation of D.J. Bernstein
for writing rock solid apps, I found this to be an acceptable solution outside
of the standard OpenBSD 2.7 installation.

 Thanks for the recommendations.

 If anyone is familiar with OpenBSD 2.7's standard ftpd, and knows of a way
to limit user connections, please drop me a line. I've been going through docs
and just about every site I could find on the net, and can't find a way of
doing it.

 I'm not interested in running ProFTP, muddleftp or any other package, other
than what comes in the standard OpenBSD 2.7 installation.

 Thanks,
