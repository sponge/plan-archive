 Oops. Forgot to mention that;

 192.246.40.37:27913 is now our 64 player map server =)

 --- Feb.23.1998 (7:45pm) ---

 We've released three 64 player deathmatch maps at;

ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/maps/dm_64.exe

 Here's the contents of the readme.

---

 Here are three large deathmatch maps that we've cooked up for Quake II.
It is recommended that, as a client, you have at least 32 megs of RAM
to use these maps. As a server, you should get the beefiest processor
and as much memory as you can get your hands on if you wish to run a 64 
player server. In tests that we ran here at id, a PPro200 peaks at about 
50 clients, and our 400mhz Alpha started sweating at about 64 players.

 The maps should be extracted to your \quake2\baseq2\maps directory and
they are named as follows;

	base64.bsp  - Tim Willits
	city64.bsp  - Paul Jaquays
	sewer64.bsp - Christian Antkow

 These three maps run in a loop.

 Enjoy,

 -Xian

 I forgot how much NT bites for deleting files that are in use, and as a 
result, I moved the server page over to my Linux machine at;

http://inferno.idsoftware.com/q2servers

 --- Feb.23.1998 (5:14pm) ---

 Worked on the webpage today to display servers from our master.

 The URL is http://www.idsoftware.com/q2servers. It's updated
every 5 minutes or so (Hit reload in your browser).

 The next task is to get QPlug working with Quake II servers... 

 /me goes back to work

 I'm doing some work on a webpage to display a list of
servers from our Quake II master, however, by default, dedicated
servers do not report their presense to our master.

 If you would like for your server to start reporting to our master,
"set public 1" in the console of your dedicated server (by default, 
servers run at "public 0"; They don't report to us).

 I should have more news in a few days, and thanks in advance for 
your co-operation.

 I know that there is a portion of the community that is rabid about
wanting "Namefun" implemented into Quake II, and have even gone so far
as to creating petitions to get us to put it back into Quake II.

 It doesn't look like it's going to happen for the following two 
reasons.

 - Namefun users appear as garbage text on dedicated servers. Yes, we know 
you kick users by number, but you still have to be able to recognize the 
name enough to know who to kick, and namefun makes this difficult.

 - Animated Names: This sends ALL your userinfo data to everyone on the
server every time your name animates. This is hell for modem users.

 If you are experiencing "Error during initialization", make sure
you are running Quake II from the icon that was created when you
installed Quake II off the CD.

 We have encountered a problem with the latest release (3.12)
Dedicated servers may crash once in a while. We are looking into the
problem and hope to release a small fix soon.
