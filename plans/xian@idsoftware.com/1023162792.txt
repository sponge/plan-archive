 Caryn "Hellchick" Law over at Activision doesn't have a .plan file, so she
asked if I'd mind posting this in my .plan here, so, uhh, yeah... here it goes.

Thanks to Xian, I'm now running a Wolf server that's dedicated to running maps
(and mods, when they come out) from the community. The server name will show 
up as [id] Hellchick's Community Server, and the IP is 192.246.40.42:27960.
 
The server should be running a map rotation right now of five maps. You can 
find out what's running at my quick and dirty info page: 
<a href="http://www.hellchick.net/server/">http://www.hellchick.net/server/</a>.
This page will have links and a list so you can grab what's running. 
 
I'm planning on changing the map rotation every couple of weeks and I'd like 
to run the community maps you guys all want to see. For now, you can email me 
at hcserver@hellchick.net to tell me what maps you want to see running (and 
let me know if there's any issues with the server variables -- they may need 
changing). When I'm able to, I'll be moving all of the server information pages 
over to the official site (castlewolfenstein.com) and putting up things like 
polls so you can vote on what you want to play.
 
Enjoy the server and let me know what you think!

 Just a reminder, to those of you who play on our servers, I'm running
stats and forums at;

<a href="http://underworld.idsoftware.com/wolf">http://underworld.idsoftware.com/wolf</a>

 We have quite the little community built up around our servers ! I'll set up 
a forum for Hellchicks servers as well. If you haven't played on any of our
servers, by all means, stop by !
