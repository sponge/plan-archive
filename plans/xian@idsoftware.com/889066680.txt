 The CTF v1.02 source is up;

 ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2-ctf-source.exe -- Win32 Installer
 ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/ctf/q2ctf-1.02-source.shar.Z -- Linux Installer

 As you probably know by now, the game.dll source code has been released.

 Here's the locations on our FTP site;

 ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2-3.14-source.exe -- Win32 Installer
 ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2source-3.14.shar.Z -- Linux Installer

 To get the Linux source, simply uncompress q2source-3.14.shar.Z, then sh q2source-3.14.shar and, if you agree with the terms of the license agreement, type yes. It will decompress the source and makefile to the current directory.

 Thanks to Mike Dowell for e-mailing and letting me know about about a fix
with Q2Plug and IE4.

 You should create a one byte file called foo.quake2, not foo.quake as was
previously outlined. This is due to the MIME types changing in the new QPlug
and IE4 needing something to download along with using a Netscape plugin 
(can you say kludge?)

 To update the example as posted on Redwoods;

&ltEMBED type=application/x-q2plug-plugin src="/foo.quake2" name="192.246.40.37:27910" width=600 height=25 PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.idsoftware.com/q2plug">

 There are some issues with Q2Plug and MS IE 4.0 (surprise surprise).
It does work fine under Netscape however. I'll chat with Zoid later on today
and see what the problems are.

 Remember, our server page is located at http://inferno.idsoftware.com/q2servers

 If you wish to report to our master, be sure to set "public 1" in the console of your
dedicated server (or put "set public 1" in your server.cfg). Right now the page
just displays all servers who have updated to v3.14 (Available on our FTP site)

 I've started keeping track of the number of clients for all the
servers that connect to our master and set "public 1" for reporting,
and came up with the following graph which shows you the number
of players on all of the servers that reports to us.

 This is usefull for determining "peak times" for when people are playing =)

 You can check it out at http://inferno.idsoftware.com/usage. I'll probably update
the graph on a daily basis.
