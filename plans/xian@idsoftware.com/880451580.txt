"The stress of completing Quake II becomes too much as Paul Steed takes out his aggressions on John Carmacks door with a sword..."

 Well, here comes that flaming ball of fire in the sky called the sun again.

 Coffee and Coke (tm) are my friends.

 Work log for today:

* did stuff
* got frustrated when stuff was giving me tude
* played Q2 deathmatch with the Ritual guys, Vik Long, and Thresh
  (sCary's kung-fu is better than my kung-fu)
* killed Thresh a few times (w00!)
* went back to cursing why stuff was giving me tude
* got Brian to look over stuff
* did the happy dance of joy when Brian found source of tude
* proceeded to do more stuff
* decided to go home and sleep when I saw the sun peering through my
  office window

 Just a quick note. Our DS3 came online today linking us into Mae-East (blech). 
John Cash informs me that our link to Mae-West should be operational
in two weeks or so. 

 I'm taking Inferno (our QuakeWorld server) down, and I've replaced it 
with three new servers (satan.idsoftware.com);

 Death32 	192.246.40.37:27000
 Deathmatch32   192.246.40.37:27002 (DM2 through DM6)
 Episodes32	192.246.40.37:27003 (The episode levels)

 I know that quite a few of you have complained about shitty pings to
our QuakeWorld servers since we've switched providers. The routes are still
settling and probably will be for the next few hours or so, but we're fairly
confident that the new links should improve your pings to us now.

 Please let me know if you are a regular on our servers and you've noticed
any changes for better or worse as a result of the new pipe.

 Zoid just demonstrated to me the Teardrop (IP Fragment overlap) exploit
by crashing my NT box =) Symptoms of this exploit are a completely locked machine
(You need to power down to restart).

 Thankfully, Microsoft has released a patch for NT users. You must have Service
Pack 3 installed first.

 Oh my god! It's snowing in Texas!

 I've recieved quite a few e-mails from people about my musical
tastes and where I get my stuff from. Apparently, FLA's 
"Columbian Necktie" is hard to get ahold of.

 I order a good 80% of my CD's from Isolation Tank (http://www.isotank.com) 
They are quite good at stocking a lot of CD's. Definately check them
out if you are into Ambient, Techno and Industrial.
 
 Tell 'em Xian from id sent ya =)

 Heh, all this talk of Quake II release dates on the various 
web pages brings to mind an outing Brian and I had last week.

 We went to Electronics Boutique to look around for new stuff
and I asked the sales clerk for a release date for G-Police.
He rambled off a date after consulting his "Book of Dates".

 Feeling cocky, I asked him for a release date for Quake II.
After consulting his sacred "Book of Dates", he proudly proclaimed
"November 24th!". Brian and I looked at each other and chuckled.

 After identifying ourselves, we shot the shit for a while and
explained to him that any dates that have been provided are
pure speculation. We're shooting for Christmas, and will go
to a gold master "soon", in "two weeks", and "when it's done" =)
