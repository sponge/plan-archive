 I know that there is a portion of the community that is rabid about
wanting "Namefun" implemented into Quake II, and have even gone so far
as to creating petitions to get us to put it back into Quake II.

 It doesn't look like it's going to happen for the following two 
reasons.

 - Namefun users appear as garbage text on dedicated servers. Yes, we know 
you kick users by number, but you still have to be able to recognize the 
name enough to know who to kick, and namefun makes this difficult.

 - Animated Names: This sends ALL your userinfo data to everyone on the
server every time your name animates. This is hell for modem users.

 If you are experiencing "Error during initialization", make sure
you are running Quake II from the icon that was created when you
installed Quake II off the CD.

 We have encountered a problem with the latest release (3.12)
Dedicated servers may crash once in a while. We are looking into the
problem and hope to release a small fix soon.
