<u>Map Editing Stuff</u>

I've received a few e-mails from people asking about how to go about
making rocket arena maps (where everyone spawns in with all the
items).

1) Create all the entities you wish the player to spawn into the
world with, and make sure they are somewhere within the world (they
can be hanging off in space somewhere within the confines of your
world.)

2) Add a "target_give" entity somewhere in the world.

3) Create all the spawn spots you wish to be in your map.

4) Select the "target_give" entity.

5) Select an entity in the map you placed in step 1 that you wish the
player to spawn in with.

6) Hit Ctrl-K in the editor to link the two items together.

7) Repeat steps 4 through 6 until the target_give is linked to all
the entities you wish the player to spawn into the world with.

8) Select a spawn spot

9) Select the target_give entity

10) Hit Ctrl-K in the editor to link the two entities together.

11) Repeat steps 8 through 10 until all the spawn spots are linked to
the target_give entity.

12) BSP your map

13) Set g_gametype to tournament mode and set fraglimit of 1(Sorry, I
forget what the number is offhand)

14) Get a bunch of your friends to connect into your server and have
fun playing a "Rocket Arena" style game =)

 An alternate use of target_give is how I used it in q3dm10 to create the
"power tube" that gives you health and armour. The tube has a 
trigger_multiple with a wait of 0.5, linked to a target_give which is linked
to a small health and an armour shard.

Cheers,
