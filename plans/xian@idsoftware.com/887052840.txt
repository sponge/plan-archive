 Damn Vegas rocked! This was my second time visiting the city that never
sleeps, and I look forward to going back yet again. After a rough first day
and being down $1200, I played smart all day Saturday and came ahead $1000
in the end.

 Highs

 - Getting really loaded Friday night, and playing Blackjack until the wee hours
of the morning with Paul Steed, Brandon, and John Cash (I can't remember how many
times I said "I love you man" to all the various people that evening)
 - Playing next to John Carmack when he won his 20k
 - Betting $500 on a single hand... and winning =)

 Lows

 - All day Saturday (I can't remember how many Lawnguyland Ice Tea's I drank
the night before...)
 - Nikki + Booze + my winning streak

 /me goes back to work
