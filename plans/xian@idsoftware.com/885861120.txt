 Whoever the moron is out there who is sending spoofed server packets
to our QuakeWorld master can stop now. Zoid fixed that on the 22nd
(See Below), and you're just wasting your time and our bandwidth.

 Microsoft has released a Bonk fix for Windows 95.

 w00! Thanks to Dan Miller for passing on that People Magazine's Most 
Intriguing People of '97 votes are in!

 Bruce Campbell got in at position 5!!!

 Big thanks out to Zoid for fixing up the QuakeWorld Masters in the latest
round of hax0r attacks. Looks like some brainiac flooded our masters with fake
"New Server" messages and caused chaos for GameSpy and our QuakeWorld webpage.

 Should be fixed now.

 I've received a number of e-mails from people inquiring about methods they
can use to optimize their maps for speed in Quake II.

 My immediate response is "Do you know about Area Portals and Hint Brushes?"
Chances are they've heard about areaportals, but Hint Brushes produces a "Huh?"

 So I took some time today while one of my maps was BSPing to make a quick tutorial
on how to use hint brushes.

 Quake II: Hint Brushes Demystified

 Hint Brushes (a brush with a texture name of "hint") are a way of telling the viser to 
treat the contents of the brush as a seperate volume. This is particularily usefull in 
forcing the viser to break the PVS in certain cases.

 Given our Sample Area (Screenshot: 12k), we can enable a feature of
Quake II that the designers here at id have all grown to know and love, gl_showtris 1.
This tells Quake II to draw all the triangles which make up a scene (PLEASE NOTE: You will
need a GL card with a full OpenGL implementation in order to use this feature. This does not
work on 3DFX.) This is particularily usefull because you can see where the PVS breaks
(if it breaks at all) in any given area, as well as showing you the complexity of a
scene. By turning on r_speeds 1 and gl_showtris 1 for the scene in our
sample map, we see that the speeds run at a respectable 310 and we can see the 
triangles which make up the scene (Screenshot: 81k). Hardly in need of optimization but,
assuming that this was a horribly complex area...

 What I would do in this case, is stick an 8 unit wide hint brush a ways into each
left and right pipe, as well as the pipe which runs vertically through the floor.
This takes a bit of knowledge of how the vis process works and you have to sort
of second-guess the engine as to what it might see from any given spot.
There is no "correct" way to do this, you sort of have to go on your gut feeling
as to where to place the hint brushes (Editor Screenshot: 96k).

 After re-bsping the map with hint brushes in place, we can see that we've shaved off
57 polygons (Screenshot: 77k) from that particular view. Not
a tremendous savings in this case, but sometimes it really makes a difference when you 
try to have your levels running at sub 600 poly scenes.
 
 Go forth and experiment =)
