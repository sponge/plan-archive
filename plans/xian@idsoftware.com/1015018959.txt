 Well, doesn't look like the large 64 player server was very popular, 
so in it's place, I've now set up a MP_BEACH server at;

 gameserver2.idsoftware.com (192.246.40.64)
 [id] Xian's MP_BEACH Server

 Check it if you are a regular on any of our servers. If it becomes
popular, I'll start keeping stats for it.

 Maxlives are in full effect.

 For those of you who enjoy playing on my Wolfenstein servers, you will 
find the following link interesting =)

 Stats are updated every hour on the hour.

 Enjoy,

 I made some changes to our network configuration this evening (Big thanks
goes out to Tapper @ <a href="http://www.worldogl.com">WorldOGL</a>).

 To those people who regularily play on our gameservers, I would greatly
appreciate it if you could drop me a quick line letting me know if your
game experience on our servers has been better / worse / no difference
since about 8:30pm CST today.

 Things *SHOULD* be *MUCH* better as a result of the reconfigurations.

 Thanks,

 -Xian
