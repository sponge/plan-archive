 Wolfenstein Linux binaries are now up on our FTP server. *BIG* thanks to
Timothee for kicking ass in getting this stuff up. 

 I've been testing the OSX server at xian-osx.idsoftware.com that Graeme 
built, and it seems pretty darn stable, so hopefully that will be released 
in the very near future as well.

 Cheers,
