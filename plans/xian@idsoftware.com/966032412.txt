 <u>Front Line Assembly Q3A MP3's</u>

 If you are a fan of Bill Leeb's projects, (Front Line Assembly, Delerium,
Intermix, etc...) you may be interested to know that I've received
permission from Kevin Cloud, Todd Hollenshead, and Bill Leeb himself, to 
make available, 44k, 128bit Stereo MP3's of the tracks he did for 
Quake III Arena.

 Enjoy.
