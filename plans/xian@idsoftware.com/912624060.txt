 Unix releases are located in their usual spot in ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/unix
and the shar versions of the source releases are located in ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/source

 This is, for all intents and purposes, the last official release of Quake II.

 Nothing has changed from the 3.20 beta. It was deemed stable, and was mastered
on Extremeties.
