 I'm looking for a Win32 port of the unix top command. We're phasing out
our IRIX box, and top was a way we could tell if anyone else is BSPing on
the machine. Since moving to Win2k for our main BSP-cruncher, we've sort of
lost the ability to accurately tell who is bsping on the machine or what
processes are running remotely, short of running to the server room and
bringing up the graphical task manager.

 I've tried using various ports of ps for Win32, but they just don't work all
that well.

 If anyone can offer some suggestions or point me in the right direction for
remote process management under Win2k, I'd greatly appreciate it (A cursory 
search of the web didn't come up with very much)

 Thanks.
