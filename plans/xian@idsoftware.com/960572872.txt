Ugh. Ok. As Todd and Graeme mentioned in their .plans, we're moving our
offices starting today, and over the weekend.

Due to circumstances beyond our control, which I don't really want to get into
at this time, we will more than likely have a serious disruption with our
network.
 
I am making it my highest priority to get the Quake 3 authentication servers
transitioned to the new office seemlessly by tommorow evening. I am hoping
that there will be little to no disruption with the Q3A authentication
servers.

Our webserver, FTP server, Mail, and more than likely, DNS server will be 
inactive for an indeterminate amount of time starting at approximately 11am 
CST on Saturday, June 10th. I'm am going to try to find a solution over the 
weekend to get mail limping along.

Again, this is a situation beyond our control. Through this experience, I've
put ISP's and Phone Companies somewhere a few points higher than lawyers on my
"scum scale rating" (previously, lawyers held a commanding lead on this scale)

I am hoping that our service will resume, in full, by Friday, June 16th. If 
not, someone at SouthWest Bell, Savvis, and MFS are going to have hell to 
pay...

Again, I apologize for any disruption that you may experience with connecting
to Quake III servers over the next few days. This situation is entirely out
of our hands, and I'm going to try my best to make this as painless as possible
for you.
