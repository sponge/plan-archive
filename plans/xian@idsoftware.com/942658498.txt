 Ok, known issues so far;

<ul>
<li>Server browser is fux0red. Will look into that tommorow</li>
<li>Problems binding and using the mousewheel</li>
<li>Can't resolve authorize.quake3arena.com. God only knows why. I've been losing my mind 
over this. Some people can resolve it fine, others can't. If someone can e-mail me with a 
definitive reason why this isn't resolving for some people, I'll be ever so greatfull. I've done 
digs off of various nameservers and most can resolve this just fine. *sigh*</li>
</ul>

 Zzzz.....
