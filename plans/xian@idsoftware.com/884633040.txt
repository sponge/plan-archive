 FINALLY!!!!

 Oh and for reports of our webserver being hacked this weekend, that was not the case.
What happened was, I had upgraded IIS to version 4 (which I'm kicking myself in the ass
for already. The FTP service has crashed twice now under v4. Never has done that before), 
and it had installed it's webserver components (Which we don't use. We use O'Reilly's 
Website.) Before I was able to remove the Microsoft webserver components, the machine
was bonked while I was away doing laundry. So when the machine restarted, it restarted with
Microsoft's Webserver, and not Website.

 There you have it.

 Wacky Fix du Jour

 If you are playing with 3DFX based boards and are experiencing some
connection difficulties or general wierdness over the net with a modem
connection, make sure you are running the updated 3DFX MiniDriver for Quake II.

 I've heard reports that it's fixed some play issues in some cases.
For what it's worth, the updated minidriver will be included in the 
Quake II Deathmatch Pack "soon".

 If you are overflowing on connecting to alpha2.idsoftware.com, try
setting;

 "msg 2"

 In the console. This will only print any "say" message, and client
connect/disconnect messages. This should *REALLY* cut down the number
of messages you get.

 Quake II Server Load Testing

 Tim Willits has a version of an upcoming map, Base100(2.5 megs), ready to test out, 
and we'd like to do some serverload testing with this map.

 Please download the aforementioned map, and connect to;

 alpha2.idsoftware.com

 ... which will be running base100.bsp. Please note that you will need a 
system with 32megs of memory to run these ginormous multiplayer maps 
(The BSP is 5.2 megs).

 All our other Quake II servers are offline while we are testing base100.

 Be a part of history =) Join in on the biggest Quake II multiplayer game yet!

 NOTE: DO NOT redistribute this map in any way. 
This map is being released for the purposes of server load testing here at id.
There will be a final release of this map "soon".

 Rant

 GODFUCKINGDAMNIT! Don't you just HATE new attacks?!?! First it was 
TearDrop... Now it's Bonk. Am I going to have to start doing REAL work
on a Linux machine that doesn't go down every 10 minutes because of attack du jour?!?!

 Of the four computers in my office, it's only the ones running NeXTStep and Linux
that give me the least amount of problems and each having uptimes in excess of 50 days.

 Microsoft: PLEASE FIX BONK ALREADY!

 Win 95 TCP/IP Fixes for Quake II

 Ok. After trading e-mail with a few people from Microsoft, and a few users
who were experiencing problems that were fixed yesterday, here's what you should do if
you are having problems running Quake II over the net (or getting ADDRNOTAVAIL errors).

 First off, if Qfecheck reports problems with your TCP/IP subsystem, 
there are a few scenarios.<
