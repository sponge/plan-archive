 Well, I finally got around to playing StarCraft, and I have to say that I'm not 
all that impressed. Sure it looks pretty, but I can't help but to think "It's been
done before..." Seems to be that way with a lot of realtime strategy games lately.
The only RTS game that has really piqued my interest so far this year has been BattleZone.
It's by far my favorite game so far this year. It *REALLY* puts you in command of the
action. Definately a refreshing change to the already oversaturated genre.

 If you're a fan of RTS games, and haven't yet played BattleZone, I highly recommend it.

 Wow! What a fun day at the dragstrip! Took some pics and they are available at;

 Something was kinda fux0red with my camera (think I had the wrong setting or something)
and a few of them turned out blurry, but it'll at least give you an idea of the day we
had.

 John Romero and Don MacAskill also took some pictures as well, so hopefully they will
surface on the web sometime soon.

 /me goes back to work
