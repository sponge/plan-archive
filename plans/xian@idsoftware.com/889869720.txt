 Oops.

 Turns out the QuakeWorld masters running at 192.246.40.37 pegged out CPU usage
under NT (Never had that problem while it was running on a unix system).

 As a result, they will now permanently be running on;

 192.246.40.250 (inferno.idsoftware.com)

 Nothing has changed with the ports. To rehash;

 192.246.40.250:27000 -- Limbo (Servers which don't bother reporting to the 
                         proper masters)
 192.246.40.250:27002 -- CTF Servers
 192.246.40.250:27003 -- Team Fortress
 192.246.40.250:27004 -- Modified Progs
 192.246.40.250:27006 -- Deathmatch Only Servers

 I'm terribly sorry for the confusion. Again, the masters on idgecko will be 
permanently shut down at 3:00pm CST later today. Please update your GameSpy data
to reflect these server changes.

 Also, for those of you who perhaps haven't purchased Quake II yet and want to 
try out the first part of the game, we've released the Demo at;

 ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2-314-demo-x86.exe (40 megs)

 This demo includes deathmatch and co-op play along with the single player game
experience.

 On a somewhat related note, if someone can recommend a reliable FTPD for Windows
NT that includes download resume capabilities, please drop me an e-mail at xian@idsoftware.com
