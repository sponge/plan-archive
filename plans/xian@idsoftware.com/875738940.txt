 "Because it's a free product, it's pretty darn compelling."
		-- Bill Gates on IE 4.0

 Yeah Bill... Compelling me to run Netscape.

 I just love it how screen redraws are four times slower with Active Desktop,
my taskbar mysteriously reloads, removing the contents of my systray, and how
IE randomly hangs while trying to load webpages, forcing me to terminate the 
process.

 Try again Microsoft. Maybe you'll get it right with 4.1.

Small Print: Yes. Four times slower on screen redraws is an exageration, but you get
the point. It's more like twice as slow. Ok, well, maybe 1.728 times slower...
