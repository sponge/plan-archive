 Lesson of the day: The stock market sucks.

 Despite TDFX's record earnings for last quarter, the stock closed today
down $2 3/8 at $19 3/8 a share.

 Can someone please explain to me how that makes sense? The stock has been
tanking since shortly after they announced last quarter earnings. I'd like 
to consider myself an intelligent and rational person. Rationalle would lead 
one to believe that a company manufacturing excellent products, holding
quite a large chunk of market share for consumer based 3D accelerators, having
no major competitors at the moment, and crushing earnings expecations for last 
quarter, would see their stock value steadilly increase. Instead, it's going in 
the opposite direction.

 *sigh*

 I guess the stock market is like gambling...

 Due to popular demand, I've set up inferno.idsoftware.com as a 
Quake II server again. I'm surprised at how many hardcore people
mail me at least once a week asking for Inferno to be put back up
again. It's cycling through the q2dm* maps at the moment, and true
to Inferno's old spirit, it'll be the testbed for any wacky gameplay
ideas we want to experiment with.
