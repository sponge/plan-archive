We're looking to contract a sound designer to work on weapon sounds, impact 
sounds, monster sounds, world ambience, machinery, etc for our upcoming game, 
DOOM 3. Basically, you will be responsible for creating a lot of sounds that 
will be used in the game.

 What I'm looking for:
 ===============

 - ~2+ years professional experience in sound design
 - Foley work a plus
 - Plays well with others
 - Able to work well under stress
 - Takes direction well, and is open to suggestion
 - Ability to synthesize sfx from scratch using either hardware or software 
as well as being able to do new and interesting things with sfx cd's (We have 
a load of Sound Ideas and Hollywood Edge sfx libs) If we don't have an SFX 
lib that you are familiar with, it's within our budget to purchase things as 
necessary.
 - Fleshing out the world soundscape using our proprietary tools (Shouldn't 
take you longer than 10 minutes to learn if you are familiar with FPS-type 
games)

 We're primarily a Windows shop here, and, provided the request is reasonable, 
we can purchase additional hardware and/or software to better facilitate getting 
the job done while working here at the office.

 We do *NOT* have a sound studio here at id, so if you need to get any Foley 
work done, we can arrange to rent some studio time somewhere in Dallas.

 Must be able to work in Mesquite, TX (about 10 minutes East of Dallas) here at 
the id offices.

 The length of the contract may last upwards of six months, and may run longer 
if required.

 Interested parties should contact me at xian@idsoftware.com with "[D3 Sound]" 
in the subject, or you can mail demo CD's to the following address.

 c/o Christian Antkow
 3819 Towne Crossing Blvd #222
 Mesquite, TX 75150

 If you'd like to send demo's to me via email, you can do so, but please email 
me in advance to let me know that you will be sending a large attachment.

 We're looking to bring someone aboard ASAP. More details will be given to the 
prospective applicant after reviewing demo's.

 Due to the nature of this position, and the requirement to work here at the id
offices, we are looking for a US resident, or someone legally able to work in
the United States.

 Please note, that due to the expected volume of applicants for this position, 
we may not be able to personally respond to each applicant.

 Cheers,

 -Xian
