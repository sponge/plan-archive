Worldtouch Network Inc. Part 2 (Not Quake Related)

 Wow, well, in the last 12 hours, I've recieved over 50 e-mails
from people who have been spammed by WorldTouch Networks (You can
stop sending me e-mails now. Thank you. It's clear that they are a 
big problem)

 Part of the reason I'm shedding light on these people and giving them
more attention than they deserve is;

1) They abuse mail relays (making it difficult to block)
2) They do not provide a proper return address (making it difficult to filter)
3) They waste network resources (genuine losers in life...)
4) They have not removed us from their mailing list despite repeated
   phone-in requests (if I had a rocket launcher...)

 Normally, when id get's spammed, I just block the server in our
mailserver, but because these people use mail relay du jour, i'd
be blocking out some valid mailservers which is not what I want to do.

 I have been professional and patient with the people at Worldtouch Networks
in trying to get idsoftware.com removed from their spam lists. After two months
of waiting, and numerous spams later, I've decided that they don't care.

 If you have been spammed by WorldTouch Networks, and wish to be removed,
I highly urge you to call their unpublished number at (213) 937-9213 and ask them
to remove you from their list, and put you in their blackbook that they make a 
mention of in their spam. If you are the owner of a domain, ask them to remove
your domain from their lists. Call as often as it takes to have your address removed.
They claim it takes 24 hours before any action is taken.

 If anyone has ever been spammed, and continues to be spammed by 
the people who make some spam software called Bulls Eye Gold...


EMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!
Bull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.
This program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email
addresses.  Doctors, florists, MLM, biz opp,...you can collect
anything...you are only limited by your imagination!  You can
even collect email addresses for specific states, cities, and
even countries!  All you need is your web browser and this program.

 ... please drop me a line. I want to try and find out how much of
a problem these guys are as we get spammed by them at least twice a week
and calls to their offices to have our domain removed have proved ineffective.

 I've set up a server here running the deathmatch maps from Xatrix's 
mission pack.

 It's up at;
