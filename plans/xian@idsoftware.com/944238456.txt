 Q3ADemo.exe for Win32 has been uploaded to Sandpiper. I'm waiting for a callback
from their NOC to verify that replication has been started. It should hopefully
be live sometime before 1pm CST if all goes well.

 On another note, I thought it important to address a security issue with your
Quake 3 config files for the commercial release.

 When you enter your CD Key, we store it in q3config.cfg in the cl_cdkey cvar.
Unencrypted. Please treat your retail config files as you would the alarm code
to your house, or the PIN number on your bank card. If you must send your configs
to someone, please make sure to edit out the "set cl_cdkey xxx..." line.

 It was brought to my attention that there was a scam with Half-Life CD Keys a
while back where people were asked to e-mail their configs to HLSupport@hotmail.com
or something to that effect, and I'd hate to see an innocent customer unknowingly
succumb to a similar scam with Q3A.

 Cheers,
