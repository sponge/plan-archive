 Thanks to everyone writing in about online cable places. If anyone else
is interested, I thought I'd post the URL's that were provided;

http://www.redcab.com/
http://www.blackbox.com/
http://www.cablestogo.com/
http://www.customcable.com/
http://www.cablesamerica.com/

 And for the curious, I need this cable in order to stack together two
EMagic Unitor-8 MIDI patch bays on my Windoze PC (The RS-422 to RS-232 adaptors
weren't provided in the box. *sigh*)

 Thanks again.

 If anyone knows of any good places on the net that sell computer cables,
please drop me a line with any URL's. I'm kinda getting sick of going to 
CompUSA and finding that they never have what I'm looking for, or going to
Fry's to wade through their sea of cables only to find that they don't have
that I'm looking for either. Specifically, I'm looking for a Mac RS-422 (?) to
9 pin female RS-232.

 Thanks a bunch,

 -Xian
