 Q2 v3.16 Update
 ---------------

 We were doing some playtesting of the Q2 3.16 patch over the net this
evening and things are looking very promising for a release "soon". Just
wanted to make this update becase quite a few of you have been inquiring
about it's status.

 Here are the things that have changed since v3.15

- Fixed infinite grenade bug
- Fixed autodownloading to actually download sounds and console pics
- Fixed autodownload to not create empty directories for files not on
  the server.
- Added customized client downloading.  cvars are the same as the server side:
    allow_download - global download on/off
    allow_download_players - players download on/off
    allow_download_models - models download on/off
    allow_download_sounds - sounds download on/off
    allow_download_maps - maps download on/off
  They can also be (more easily) set with a new Download Options menu 
  accessible in Multiplayer/Player Setup/Download Options
- Changed checksumming code to be more portable and faster.
  The checksum in 3.15 was seriously broken.
  This change makes 3.16 incompatible with previous servers.
- Fixed it so sounds played for PPMs that default to male are only checked
  on disk once.
- Fixed player 'warping' present in 3.15 (this was an artifact of the
  hyperblaster optimizations).
- Fixed the autodownload in 3.15 so that stuff like skins for models are
  downloaded as well as pics.

 If you've downloaded the v3.15 patch, you'll be able to download a small
200k file which just updates your quake2.exe. 

 3.16 clients will NOT be backwards compatible for multiplayer. Your
3.15 savegames for single player will work just fine however.

 Thanks for your continued patience, but we want to make sure this update is 
damned solid before we release. Just a little bit longer now =)
