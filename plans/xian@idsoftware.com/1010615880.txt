 Todd asked me to make an update to my last .plan.

 Please submit any bugs in playtesting on the below servers to;

 wolfbugs@idsoftware.com

 ... and not my email address. We'd like all bug reports to be
channeled through one central location (Yes! A real live human does actually
go through that email account !)

 Also, I said the patch will be released in "two weeks", not two weeks =)

 I keep forgetting sometimes that as the community grows with newer fans and 
players, some of you may not be familiar with old-school id lingo.

 "two weeks", "when it's done", "soon", etc... simply means "when it's done".

 Sorry for the confusion.

 We're currently testing the release candidate for Wolf 1.1 (will be released 
in "two weeks"). I'm running the latest server code on all my servers, so if 
people could play on them for a few days, and forward any bugs/issues they 
encounter to xian@idsoftware.com, we would greatly appreciate the feedback.

 Thanks,
