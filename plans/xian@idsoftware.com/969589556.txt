 If anyone is familiar with OpenBSD 2.7's standard ftpd, and knows of a way
to limit user connections, please drop me a line. I've been going through docs
and just about every site I could find on the net, and can't find a way of
doing it.

 I'm not interested in running ProFTP, muddleftp or any other package, other
than what comes in the standard OpenBSD 2.7 installation.

 Thanks,
