<b>id's Wolfenstein Server Stuff</b>

Just an FYI to those reading this, and playing on our servers, I've recently
installed OSP 0.22 on our Tram server, which has resulted in some people not
knowing how to, or not able to connect.

You can download OSP 0.22 for Wolfenstein at the following location.

http://www.orangesmoothie.com/html-downloads.html

Make sure the files get extracted to wolfosp and you should be good to go.
