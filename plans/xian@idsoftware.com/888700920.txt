 I've started keeping track of the number of clients for all the
servers that connect to our master and set "public 1" for reporting,
and came up with the following graph which shows you the number
of players on all of the servers that reports to us.

 This is usefull for determining "peak times" for when people are playing =)

 You can check it out at http://inferno.idsoftware.com/usage. I'll probably update
the graph on a daily basis.
