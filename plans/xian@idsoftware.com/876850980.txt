 Here's an e-mail I sent out to Quake webmasters this morning;


 I'd like to make a formal request that if anyone send's you logs of 
myself on IRC, please don't publish them. I hate being logged. When 
I'm on IRC, I'm there to relax and shoot-the-shit (if you know 
what I mean). Not to be logged.

 There's no worse feeling in the world than coming into work in the 
morning, and seeing something you said last night while you were 
sleep depraved, plastered all over the news pages =)

 Thanks in advance for your co-operation.


 If you do feel content is indeed newsworthy, at least verify the 
source, or ask permission for a quote.

 It kinda sucks that real life journalism practices (ie: "Can I quote
you on that?") don't apply to the web.world of journalism. This isn't a 
flame. Merely an observation.

 /me goes back to work

 Did I ever mention how much I hate being quoted in IRC logs?
