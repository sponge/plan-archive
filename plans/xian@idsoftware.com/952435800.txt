 Thanks to everyone who e-mailed me about anti-spam resources. For the 
curious, here are the three most popular URL's that were provided.

 Does anyone know of a somewhat official list, that is actively updated, that
contains IP's of known mail relays which spammers exploit. I know that some
ISP's make use of IP blocks to prevent their customers from recieving spam,
and I'm looking to implement something similar in-house.

 On a Q3A related note, if you haven't checked out the Hulk mod yet, it's
pretty neat. Myself and a bunch of the people from the Old Man Murray forums
have been playing it over the last few evenings, and it's a lot of fun =)
