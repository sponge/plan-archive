 For those of you who love playing WolfMP on high maxclients servers like the
Happy Penguin server (64 clients), you'll be pleased to know that I'm now
running a high maxclients server here at id !

192.246.40.64:27960 - [id] Xian's BUST-A-CAP Rotation !

 It's rotating through all the maps (except Castle) in stopwatch mode (4 rounds
per map) with friendly-fire turned off.

 We hope to see you there !

 Cheers,

 -Xian
