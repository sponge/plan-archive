 Well, seems like my request for serveradmins to use the correct port went
largely unheard. Here's the new structure.

 192.246.40.12:27000    Limbo (Big, unorganized mess)
 192.246.40.12:27006    Deathmatch 
 192.246.40.12:27002    CTF
 192.246.40.12:27003    Team Fortress
 192.246.40.12:27004    Modified Progs
