 I will make sure to update the official Q3Test mirrors page at 
www.quake3arena.com tommorow morning when I get in.

 In the meantime, be sure to check out www.bluesnews.com or 
www.shugashack.com for download locations.

 I also did some tuning on the webserver earlier and it should have fixed
the slow connections some of you wrote in about (it turned out that GLSetup
was using HTTP to download drivers, and it was maxing out our webserver at
160 connections. Oops. It's been fixed now). We also upped the bandwidth 
from our provider, so connections to our network should be more responsive
and connections to our gameservers should yield lower pings in general (we
outgrew our bandwidth cap which was really messing things up connectivity-
wise)

 Zzzzzz....

Stuff: I played on Vallon Zek in EQ briefly today (One of the new racewar
servers). Started an Erudite Cleric named Achmed as part of the Axiom (my
guild on Cazic Thule) branch on the racewar server. 130 people in Tox Forest.
Yeah, right. I'm so used to playing as Haujobb, my level 32 High Elf wizard on
Cazic Thule, that I've grown used to my inherent night vision granted to all 
the elven classes. Not being able to see in the dark blows. Tox Forest gets 
my vote for the worst newbie zone in the entire game. At least Nektulos Forest
Branches off of Lava Storm and East Commons. Tox branches off to... err... 
Kerra Isle and... water... You die off Qeynos and you're all the way back in Tox.
Fun. Not. Decided to call it quits after John Carmack and John Cash witnessed
me getting my ass handed to me on a plate by a skunk.

 You can't do the sense heading, move forward double bind anymore either =(

 Did I mention how much riding boats sucks ?
