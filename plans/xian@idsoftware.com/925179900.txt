However if I am in middle of combat with someone, and they suddenly stop
and press the talk button, I'm still going to shove the rail up their
ass.  I can just see people using this to try to go, "hey l00ser, I was
talking" whenever they get killed while trying to avoid it in lame
ways.

 Right. People deserve to get railed for pulling a cheap tactic like that =)
The point I'm trying to make though, is that when someone has just spawned in
with a talk bubble over their heads, or is off somewhere facing a wall with 
their backs to the action, obviously not paying attention to combat, respect 
their talk bubble =)

 Quake 3 Rant

 Ok, when someone is facing a wall, isn't moving, and has a talk bubble over 
their head...

DON'T SHOOT AT THEM!!!

 It means they;

 a) Hit T to talk and are typing in something to say
 b) Are in the console doing something

 ...and they can't defend themselves. People who consistently kill people
with talk bubbles (and I don't mean the type of people who hit you once out of
reflex, and politely say "Sorry" either) over their heads (heretofore known as
"Typer Killers") are sub-amoeba lifeforms IMO. It's really frustrating trying 
to talk to people on servers soliciting feedback, and having my ass blown back 
to Canada (Hi Mom) every time I'm typing something.

 Thank you. I feel much better now =)
