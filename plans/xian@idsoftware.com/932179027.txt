 To expand some more on Graeme's .plan update, I've just sent out the release
build to the mirror sites and asked them to beat on it for a while on their
LANs. We don't forsee any problems with the release, but want to play it safe
by getting them to beat on it for a few hours.

 Tonight, we plan on releasing a Win32 version only. The Mac and Linux versions
are not ready to go yet.

 If all goes well with testing, I'll be giving the mirrors the go-ahead to
publicly post the file on their sites around 10pm CST.

 Stay tuned...
