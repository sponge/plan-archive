July 8th, 1998 @ 2:41pm

 I've released a new version of the q2ctf4 (Outlands) CTF map which is now available on our FTP site;

ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/maps/q2ctf4a.exe
or
ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/maps/q2ctf4a.tar.gz

 It should be extracted to \quake2\baseq2\maps. This version of the CTF map attempts to address issues with making play more balanced.

 It is currently running on our CTF server at 192.246.40.37:27913

 Thanks to Brian Hook, John Cash, the people on 3DNet and EFNet (you know who you are) for their input in making this map more balanced.

Changes for 3.17

- added sanity checks before calling atan2 with divisors of 0.  This was
  accidentally working on Intel chips, but caused crashes on DEC Alpha AXP
  port.
- updated QUAKE2.DSW and QUAKE2.DSP file to support DEC Alpha
- Autodownloading is now DISABLED by DEFAULT.  It must be enabled by typing
  'allow_download 1' at the console, or using the download options menu
  in Multiplayer/PlayerSetup/Download Options
- Server demos now include a svc_serverdata block at the beginning with the
  attractloop byte set to '2' to indicate server demo (byte before gamedir
  in the svc_serverdata block).  This allows easy identification of
  serverrecorded demos (serverrecord demos are only for demo editors, they
  can not be played back in Quake2 without being first edited).
- New options for setting texture formats in ref_gl:
  gl_texturealphamode:  default, GL_RGBA, GL_RGBA8, GL_RGB5_A1, GL_RGBA4, 
    GL_RGBA2
  gl_texturesolidmode:  default, GL_RGB, GL_RGB8, GL_RGB5, GL_RGB4,
    GL_R3_G3_B2, GL_RGB2 (SGI only)
- Player movement during Air acceleration changed to reflect more real-world 
  physics while airborne.
- Fixed a bug when riding trains that caused drift in a southwest direction
  (Thanks to Jim Dose at Ritual for pointing this one out).
- Linux:  Now correctly reports out of memory rather than segfaulting (mmap
  returns (void *)-1 and not NULL on error).
- Fixed autodownloading to not create paths for files that can't be downloaded
  (this was creating many empty directories in baseq2/players).
- When downloading a file from a server that doesn't have it, the message is
  now "Server does not have this file" rather than "File not found."
- Fixed some coop keys in 3.15 weren't being handled correctly (pyramid key).
- Highbits are now stripped from console when using condump
- Restored support for gl_modulate in multiplayer play
- Fixed it so that players with a model/skin you don't have aren't checked for 
  on disk more than once.
- Fixed it so sounds played for PPMs that default to male are only checked
  on disk once.
- Byte ordering/portability fixes in cinematics, PCX and other file handling.
- Client state during static image cinematic (PCX image) so that client can 
  continue to next unit.
- Fixed it so that dedicated coop servers no longer get stuck at victory.pcx,
  if a server is in coop mode, hitting a button at the victory.pcx screen
  while cause the server to restart at base1
- Fixed infinite grenade bug
- Fixed autodownloading to actually download sounds and console pics
- Fixed autodownload to not create empty directories for files not on
  the server.
- Added customized client downloading.  cvars are the same as the server side:
    allow_download - global download on/off
    allow_download_players - players download on/off
    allow_download_models - models download on/off
    allow_download_sounds - sounds download on/off
    allow_download_maps - maps download on/off
  They can also be (more easily) set with a new Download Options menu 
  accessible in Multiplayer/Player Setup/Download Options
- Changed checksumming code to be more portable and faster.
  The checksum in 3.15 was seriously broken.
  This change makes 3.17 incompatible with previous servers.
- Fixed player 'warping' present in 3.15 (this was an artifact of the
  hyperblaster optimizations).
- Fixed the autodownload in 3.15 so that stuff like skins for models are
  downloaded as well as pics.
