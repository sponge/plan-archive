 We're currently testing the release candidate for Wolf 1.1 (will be released 
in "two weeks"). I'm running the latest server code on all my servers, so if 
people could play on them for a few days, and forward any bugs/issues they 
encounter to xian@idsoftware.com, we would greatly appreciate the feedback.

 Thanks,
