 Our web and FTP server will be down tonight between 11pm-12pm.
I'll be working on upgrading the software and doing some maitenance
on the machine.

 Also, if anyone from Microsoft is reading this, I'm curious to 
see if there is a solution to fixing bad TCP/IP drivers that Qfecheck 
reports (ie: VTCP.386, VIP.386, WSOCK32.DLL, and a proper fix for WINSOCK.DLL, 
short of renaming WINSOCK.OLD to WINSOCK.DLL) It seems that simply installing 
an update to the Winsock drivers (ie: http://www.microsoft.com/communications/exes/wsockupd.exe) 
does not fix the problem.

 We've deduced that various connection problems with Quake II is not so much
an "us" issue as it is a TCP/IP driver version mismatch issue which is beyond
our control. If the drivers are out of whack, well...

 Is there an update, short of reinstalling your OS, which updates all the network
drivers to their latest versions? I'd appreciate direct correspondance to
xian@idsoftware.com.

 Modem Fixes with QFECheck
 -------------------------

 Some users have reported that Qfecheck states that their WINSOCK.DLL is
invalid. Upon searching their \WINDOWS directory, they report in having
a WINSOCK.DLL and WINSOCK.OLD. Upon copying their WINSOCK.DLL to a temporary
directory, then copying WINSOCK.OLD to WINSOCK.DLL, Qfecheck states that everything
is up to date, and their connection problems go away.

 Quake II Modem Connection Problems (Win95)
 ------------------------------------------

 If you are experiencing various connection problems, I've tracked it 
down to inconsistencies with Microsoft's TCP/IP drivers (ie: You've installed
update patches, and for whatever reason, some older version of the driver
were not updated. eg: VIP.386 or VTCP.386 in your \windows\system directory)

 Microsoft has a utility called Qfecheck which reports the status or your drivers and which ones are out of
date or are causing you problems. Please download this utility if you are experiencing 
problems connecting under Windows 95, and if it reports that your TCP/IP drivers 
are giving you problems, please e-mail me directly with the filenames that it's 
complaining about. I'll try to have more information available on this within the next
24 hours as I'm still trying to find a solution for this and working with people
that have been e-mailing me about this.

 It would be *VERY* helpful, if QFECHECK reports problems with your TCP/IP subsystem,
take a screen capture of the QFECHECK screen, and attach it in an e-mail to me.

 Just a quick note because I've received e-mails about this already,
but the 3.10 patch is incompatible with 3.09 servers over the net.
If you want to play with 3.10, the server you are connecting to needs to
run 3.10 as well.

 Also, just like it states in the setup program for 3.10, your previous
savegames are incompatible with patch updates. If you REALLY need to
patch to the latest version, you can always cheat yourself to an approximation
of your last savegame.

 Got back from visiting family and friends back in Toronto, and all
I can say is, I don't know how I put up with Canadian winters as long
as I did. I brought back a killer cold with me which has left me feeling 
miserable, but it's really good to be back in Texas. 

 I have a lot of catching up to do, so apologies if I'm late in returning
any e-mails.
