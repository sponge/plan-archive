<b><u>Sept.15.2000 @ 1:30pm CST</u></b>

 <u>Planned network outage</u>

 I'm going to be doing some maintenance work on our internet servers and
routers this <b>Sunday, September 17th between the hours of 2pm and 4:30pm CST</b>.
 
 Our router should be down for no more than 30 minutes starting around 4:00pm
CST. If you have difficulty accessing the Quake III master server, this is why.

 DNS will be disrupted during this maintenance period.
