 Touche. 

 Looks like the silly hax0r figured out a way around Zoid's latest
fix for the QuakeWorld Master and the masters were flooded yet again
last night with a bunch of bogus servers.
 
 Zoid's taken things a few steps further and I've updated the source here
and sent a copy of it to the Minos guys in the UK. This should keep the hax0r
busy for a while figuring out what Zoid has done this time around.

 /me waits to see what happens in round 3
