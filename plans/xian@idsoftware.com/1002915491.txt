 I saw today on <a href="http://www.securitynewsportal">www.securitynewsportal.com</a> that the Sircam
worm is due to unleash it's potential payload on Oct. 16.

 According to SNP;

"the worm will delete all the files and folders contained on the hard drives 
of randomly selected SirCam-infected computers."

 Our mailserver detects and bounces, on average, 250+ SirCam infected messages
each day, so this is one damned virulent worm (granted, 95.2% of the incoming
emails are from spamhouses, so perhaps this is poetic justice), but for the
4.8% of you out there that have legitimate reasons for emailing us, you may
wish to scan your systems in the next few days just to make sure you are all
clean =)

 For more information on this worm, see;

 And for those of you who are interested, we are using Stalker's 
Communigate Pro (<a href="http://www.stalker.com">www.stalker.com</a>) along with the
McAfee Viruscan plugin. I've evaluated loads of email servers, and this one
is by far the best one I've come across yet.
