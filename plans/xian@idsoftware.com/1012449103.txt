 I made some changes to our network configuration this evening (Big thanks
goes out to Tapper @ <a href="http://www.worldogl.com">WorldOGL</a>).

 To those people who regularily play on our gameservers, I would greatly
appreciate it if you could drop me a quick line letting me know if your
game experience on our servers has been better / worse / no difference
since about 8:30pm CST today.

 Things *SHOULD* be *MUCH* better as a result of the reconfigurations.

 Thanks,

 -Xian

 For those of you who love playing WolfMP on high maxclients servers like the
Happy Penguin server (64 clients), you'll be pleased to know that I'm now
running a high maxclients server here at id !

192.246.40.64:27960 - [id] Xian's BUST-A-CAP Rotation !

 It's rotating through all the maps (except Castle) in stopwatch mode (4 rounds
per map) with friendly-fire turned off.

 We hope to see you there !

 Cheers,

 -Xian
