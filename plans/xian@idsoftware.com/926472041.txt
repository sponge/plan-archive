 Thanks to everyone who responded about the 8 way Xeon systems. I have
enough information to do some research into it now.

 In regards to Q3Test, if anyone has mirrored it, and would like to be 
included on our mirrors page, please drop me a line with "Q3MIRROR" in the 
subject line, along with full URLS to the file locations. I'll be sure
to add them to the list tommorow when I get into the office.

 Thanks,

 -Xian
