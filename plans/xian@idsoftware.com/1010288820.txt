 Until further notice, all ICMP communications to our Q3A master server
are being blocked. This should not affect your ability to continue playing
Q3A online. It will, however, prevent you from pinging the master server
to make sure it's up and running.

 Rest assured, we have a system in place internally which notifies us of any
outages with our critical servers, and if/when they do go down, we're usually
all over it within minutes.
