 A frustrating part about reading reviews on Q3A, is how reviewers don't
state the correct facts sometimes. 98.2% of the reviews I've read state that Sonic
Mayhem did the background music for Q3A. This is only 50% true =) There are 12 
background tracks in the game. 6 were indeed done by Sonic Mayhem, and the 
remaining 6 were done by Bill Leeb and Chris Petersen of Front Line Assembly / 
Delerium fame.

 If you view the PAK file with WinZip under baseq3/music, you'll see 6 sonic*.wav
tracks and 6 fla*.wav tracks (Some of the FLA tracks were broken up into two parts
for an intro and a repeating loop part)
