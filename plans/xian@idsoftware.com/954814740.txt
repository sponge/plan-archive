 Well damn. I just finished playing about an hour and a half's worth of
Q3Fortress and boy is it ever a pleasant change of pace from frantic 
deathmatch. Much much fun was had. I definately love the sniper =P

 If you haven't played it yet, by all means, check it;

 Props to the team. I'm looking forward to the finished product.
