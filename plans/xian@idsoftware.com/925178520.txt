 Quake 3 Rant

 Ok, when someone is facing a wall, isn't moving, and has a talk bubble over 
their head...

DON'T SHOOT AT THEM!!!

 It means they;

 a) Hit T to talk and are typing in something to say
 b) Are in the console doing something

 ...and they can't defend themselves. People who consistently kill people
with talk bubbles (and I don't mean the type of people who hit you once out of
reflex, and politely say "Sorry" either) over their heads (heretofore known as
"Typer Killers") are sub-amoeba lifeforms IMO. It's really frustrating trying 
to talk to people on servers soliciting feedback, and having my ass blown back 
to Canada (Hi Mom) every time I'm typing something.

 Thank you. I feel much better now =)
