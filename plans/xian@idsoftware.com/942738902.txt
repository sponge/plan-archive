 Fixed.

 Yes. We know there are problems with the Q3Demo authorization and 
masters servers at the moment. We're working on the issues and should
hopefully have things resolved later this evening.

 Please do not send further e-mails on the matter. We are well aware of
the problems.

 Got about 50 e-mails over night with various insights into possible DNS
resolution issues with authorize.quake3arena.com. I just made a few changes
to the DNS records, Tim restarted the nameserver, and lets see if this 
doesn't get better in the next 24 hours or so.

 Ok, known issues so far;

<ul>
<li>Server browser is fux0red. Will look into that tommorow</li>
<li>Problems binding and using the mousewheel</li>
<li>Can't resolve authorize.quake3arena.com. God only knows why. I've been losing my mind 
over this. Some people can resolve it fine, others can't. If someone can e-mail me with a 
definitive reason why this isn't resolving for some people, I'll be ever so greatfull. I've done 
digs off of various nameservers and most can resolve this just fine. *sigh*</li>
</ul>

 Zzzz.....
