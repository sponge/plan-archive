	Medal of Honor is starting to look great!  What am I 
saying?!  It was looking awesome the day I started 6 months ago! 
We have some of our animation in the game and it's nice to see 
my work in the levels.  Here are some of my thoughts on 
animation.  
 
	"The Hierarchy of Great Animation" (From the bottom up)

	4. The Principles of animation. Weight, balance, wave 
	   action, follow through, anticipation.   The meat and 
	   potatoes of animation.
	3. Every event and action that is created comes from 
	   the emotions and expressions of that character.  
	   Whether it's picking up a pencil to how he/she/it
	   walks down the street.  
	2. Animation is making icons of the real world.   
	   You are not trying to mimic the real world, but 
	   bridge 
	   the gap that is made in peoples translation and 	
	   understanding of the real world.  Animate what 
	   people think they saw.
	 
And finally...

	1. Anyone that says, "that looks weird." subjugates 
	   everything else you know. If anyone doesn't 
	   understand your animation; change it immediately 
	   (that includes your mom).



Futureselfexplainingnoteaphobia 
The fear of moving into a new residence and finding a note 
from your future self, explaining your future events and how 
they will unfold in your life.  Usually with frightening 
revalations.  A person with this phobia is prone to sitting
in his/her room attempting to invoke an appearance from their 
future self. i.e.:  "If my futureself does exist, you'll appear
right now!  Right.....now! NOW!.......If you really can leave
a note, do it....now! NOW, riiight.....now! Pansyass."
