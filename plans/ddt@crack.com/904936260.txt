My steamy log.

Fri September 4, 1998

-------------------

  We are moving out of our office in order to stop the $3k/mo rent
    bills which have added up to about $11k of accumulated rent debt- barf!
    We got a lot of work done there, but I don't think I will miss the
    un-air-conditioned bathroom.  ;)

  We're switching our sendmail, finger, and http servers to another site.
    You may experince bouncing mail or broken fingers for a little while.

Mon August 24, 1998

-------------------

  Baldur's Gate looks deeeelicious.

  Those funny poles I asked about now have video cameras appearing on top.
    They're some kind of traffic monitoring gismos, prolly local to Austin.

  Publisher visit today.

  Disconneced some old unused phone lines.
  Found out what happened to our US mail.  If you get a lot of mail over a day
    or two, like too much to fit in yer mailbox, they'll hold it and not deliver
    any more until you call for it.  I thought the junk mail distributors stopped
    loving us.

Sat August 22, 1998

-------------------

  Cleaned office.

  Been working on a design doc (not Golgotha, a different thang).

Thu August 13, 1998

-------------------

  Hell yes.  Rasterman has now combined the smell of sex and candy to yield:

Tue August 11, 1998

-------------------

  Remember that scene in Tron (the movie) where the "user" is in a
    broken recognizer and brings it to life by sorta making a magic
    gesture with his hands?  That was a cool scene.

Thu August 6, 1998

-------------------

  Check out the Genesis 3d engine, a free (!) 3D sdk that was released
    a week ago.  It's at www.genesis3d.com.  Looks like it does most of
    what Unreal does, often faster.
  Publisher chats.

Wed August 5, 1998

-------------------

  Mtg w/ Cyrix.
  Phone tag.
  It's official.  Having been through the ringer a few times now, I try
    to avoid "ragging", but this has really gone a bit far.  ADP is
    a nutty operation.  Second time in a row that they've run payroll
    without noticing that a. there's no money, and b. I told them not to.
    Did you know that they actually pay your employees from their
    bank account then remove the money from your bank later?  And if
    they mistakingly paid your employees and you didn't want 'em to,
    then they take the money back from the employees' accounts (!), and if
    they can't get it back, they take it out of the employer's account.
    All a bit creepy, huh?  Add a few overdraft/NSF notices in there,
    and you have the makings of a real party.

Tue August 4, 1998

-------------------

  Still doing publisher/investor discussions.  Would love to go into
    sordid detail, but if you knew what makes the business world tick,
    you'd curl up in a ball and ask for your mommy.  I know I do.
  Also working on a design doc for a game to develop in parallel w/
    Golgotha.  It's a long shot, but man, the concept & property
    totally has me pumped.  Le pant, le puff, le meOW.

  Carly got a full-time kick-ass job w/ Origin.  *Awesome timing*  Did
    I mention I *love* my sweetie?
  But now my karma is imbalanced.  What I need right now is allergies
    and a ticket for running a red light.  Oh hey, COOL!  Ask and
    you shall receive!

Fri July 30, 1998

-------------------

  Nothing earth-shattering to report.  Lots of publisher/investor chats
    this past week.
  By the way, if you liked "Something About Mary," see "Baseketball."
    Great, dorky flick.

Mon July 27, 1998

-------------------

  Visited bank.  Gotta say it, I love the idea of automated payroll, but
    ADP really is a fairly mixed-up company, at least as boneheaded at
    payroll as I am, considering their size.
  Dropped texture CD off @ Eclipse.
  Kevin aka "Sam Hell" wrote to splain that those funny poles are actually
    repeaters, coils, and amps for telco lines.  They're not actually
    transceivers apparently.  Kevin's a CTI specialist for Nortel, so I
    believe we have this on authority.

Sat July 25, 1998

  So does anybody know what these things are?  They appear on the highway,
    and look like galvanized 8-sided telephone poles, only they're always
    cropped and a bit short, and they have a funny wire attached to the
    top in the following shape (will need to view this using a fixed
    width font):

      ,____,/
     /     
    |
    |
    |
    |     ___
    |    |   |
    +----|   |
         |   |
         .   .
         .   .
       (rest of
       long pole
       goes here)
         .   .
         .   .
         |   |
      ___|___|___

    They look like antennas of some sort, but I'm wondering, a. why are
    the poles constructed as if they were going to bear a load, and b.
    if they are antennas (cell phones?), why is the antenna in that peculiar
    shape?

Fri July 24, 1998

-------------------

  Mtg w/ Origin re: UA.
  Went to boxing match w/ Bear courtesy of Mr. G.  Much fun was had.
    Great fights.

Thu July 23, 1998

-------------------

  Set up the Linux cd burner for Kevin.
  Fixed ADP.
  Did short interview w/ a mildly smarmy interviewer for TechWeb.
    I think irc did it to him.
  "Something About Mary" is a very funny movie and will get your
    mind off your troubles in a damn hurry.  See it.
  Checked out www.linuxgames.com.  Very neato.
  The Alpha 21264 sounds good enough to eat.  And I didn't know
    FX!32 is integrated into NT 5.0.  All I can say is, I know
    what I want for Christmas.

Tue July 21, 1998

-------------------

  Investor chats.
  Sent out press release for texture cd.
  Visited Bruce from 3DO Austin.
  Visited accountant, tax phun.

  Getting some great opportunities for Gene & Stephen.  Also getting
    *flooded* by well-wishers, offers for free labor, legal advice, 
    offers to buy copies early, web hosting, free press, even food &
    shelter.  Holy Mackerel.  Thanks a lot, everybody.  That's super,
    super nice and very touching.  Best I've felt in ages, w/ or w/o a
    paycheck.  :)

  Conventional biz wisdom says you shouldn't announce this sorta thing,
    but I do so because of an annoying decency streak.  So before
    the rumors start to fly, I should announce that Crack is in deep
    financial shit.  We're not in debt and refuse to enter debt, but we
    just ran out of cash and are not making payroll.  We have a lot of
    potential opportunities, but the easy ones tend to be short-term
    band-aid-ish opportunities that detract from the company mission,
    which is Golgotha, Golgotha, and oh yes, Golgotha.  Those of us
    financially stable enough to weather some time without being paid
    will stay on.  We're all confident the money will come in, including
    those of us who can't afford the loss of income.  There is just too
    much value in the project, it's inexpensive to complete, and there
    are too many opportunities even outside Golgotha.  But two of us,
    Gene & Stephen, don't have the reserves to miss a single payroll,
    so I'd like to help place them at other companies.  Gene is a simply
    brilliant composer, and it will totally hurt to lose him.  I count
    my lucky stars that we at least got the game's soundtrack done.
    Whoever gets Gene wins The Big Prize.  I've worked with a few great
    compos
