Mon April 20, 1998

-------------------

  Carly is well again, btw.  Thanks for the well-wishing letters.
  Found out that "golgotha.com" has been freed up.  Just grabbed it.  :)
  Added a press dude to press release list.
  Read Joey's comment about VC 5.0 sp3.  We've had some interesting
    fp behavior now and again.  Been assuming it's our fault, though.
    Prolly is.
  Telstar chat.  Discussed a neat Golgotha teaser for CTW.
  Company & director meetings.
  Several mini publisher chats.
  AMD chat.
  Sent video off to publisher.
  Check out this letter from the Center for Disease Control (the
    other CDC).  I received it today.

    "Dear Colleague,

    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency of the
    US Dept. of Health and Human Services, is soliciting computer game
    developers to participate in a Cooperative Research and Developement
    Agreement (CRADA).  The purpose of the CRADA is to develop a computer
    game based on learning and applying epidemiologic principles to
    solve disease outbreaks, control environmental injuries, and promote
    pubilc health in a ficitious population.
 
    Yours,...."

  Bought/played StarCraft.  Visually gorgeous.  But not as fun as TA.
    I got through several levels saw that I was almost out of new
    toys to get for my race, and just kinda gave up.  The plot
    didn't really grab me, though other parts did.  I heard
    from our local CompUSA that it's flying off the shelves,
    tho.

Thu April 16, 1998

-------------------

  Carly is not as deathly ill today.  Went to the doctor this morning.

  Congrats to Intergraph on the successful suit against Intel.  I
  *totally* know where you're coming from.




Wed April 15, 1998

-------------------

  Carly is deathly ill.  Woke up several times last night to visit the
    loo.  Neither of us slept.  She's now shaking and weak.
    Our theory: Boston Chicken.

  Looked some more into mp3 after hearing a rumor that it costs US$1/unit
    to license.  There's a new licensing section on www.mpeg.org about
    mp3 which clears some of it up.

  Seperated asm from Glide renderer.

  Re-did shaded supertank weapons.

Tue April 14, 1998

-------------------

  Worked on C rasterizer compiling in Linux.

Thu April 9, 1998

-------------------

  Gave incremental linking with the GNU linker another look.  I can generate the relinkable
    file with the -r option of ld.  But I don't know how to properly use that relinkable file.
  More aesthetic work.

Wed April 8, 1998

-------------------

  Evangelized a radical CPU architecture idea to engineers @ Centaur, got a peek at
    their next CPU.
  More nasm conversions.  We have a buttload of inline asm for several primatives
    optimized for both MMX/3D instructions and for Pentiums.
  Got new build with loads of good stuff including flags and auto-leading.
  Reviewed avail sfx w/ Gene.
  Worked w/ Stephen on font.
  Fixed a couple aesthetic bugs.
  Chats w/ Jonathan & Oli about auto-navigation, missiles, upgrades, & fog of war.

Tue April 7, 1998

-------------------

  Missed lunch w/ Bill.  Arg!
  More nasm conversions.

Mon April 6, 1998

-------------------

  General & director meetings.
  Checked Kevin's law bldg model.
  Checked Gene's background music.
  Wrote tutorial text for Kevin.
  Long chats today about defense towers.
  Chatted up new feature to improve gameplay.

Sun April 5, 1998

-------------------

  OK, I don't normally put HTML in my plans, but this picture kinda
  rocks.  Sent to me by my (by the way very funny) brother:
 

  Linux Golgotha asm work.  Giving up on masmtogas.  Sadly, inline gas
  seems fairly broken (very hard to get it to generate the asm you want).

  Grabbing nasm.  Started converting rendering code to seperate nasm files.
  Slow, but it works.

Sat April 4, 1998

-------------------

  I tried Dominion.  Pretty fun.  Loved the sexy main menu.  I like the
  context-sensitive pop-up menus for the units and the ability to
  make the fast guys crawl so that a formation moves at roughly
  the same speed.  The umbilical thing is a neat approach, and I like
  the qix-like fence-off gameplay.  The default energy beacons don't
  make it worthwhile, but the missile/machine-gun towers definitely do.

  If I had any negative feedback, unfortunately, it would be that the
  artwork is a little wonky, which is really weird, because Ion
  is definitely good at artork (see web site, character sketches,
  etc).  And a small note, but it would be good to tighten up the
  responsiveness of the units to mouse clicks at the destination.
  Trying to think of a quick hack to test it out.  Maybe kick up
  some dust, animating some dust sprites over the unit in question
  for about half a second?  Maybe do verbal feedback as per usual
  but with a click or beep right at the start (like a CB radio)
  so that the feedback loop is tighter.

  Played Master of Orion II again.  Dunno why.  Today was
  depressing for some reason.  Both Carly and I felt it.  Our
  noodles at Kim Phuong were sticky.  We were crotchety.  And itchy.
  Maybe a shared allergy to the weekends preceding April 15.

Fri April 3, 1998

-------------------

  Tons of crazy coding/design/mgmt.

  The bluebonnets and indian paintbrushes are in bloom on the Hwy 360 median.
  Looks really neat.

  Played w/ cygwin32 this morning.

Thu April 2, 1998

-------------------

  Arg.  Glimpse generated a 30Mb index file from a 55Mb hierarchy of files.
  The searches just don't seem that fast.

  Ssh woes.

Wed April 1, 1998

-------------------

  Got a few leads for several good coder positions yesterday if anyone
  is looking.

  Fixed default & win32 error funcs.
  Added blank => current directory on level's scm file.
  Got Windows version running again.

  Played w/ level some.

Mon March 30, 1998

-------------------

  General & director mtgs.

  Fixed key-mappings.

Sun March 29, 1998

-------------------

  Relearned MMX, figured out how to do colored lighting on K6-3D.  Not free,
    but not bad.  Should also be able to do alpha-blending with both
    verticies and an alpha-channel at a decent clip.

  Played more w/ gcc inline asm.  Figured out how to get masmtogas into
    1 pass and more reliable.

Thu March 26, 1998

-------------------

  Some egcs hacking.  Got Golgotha compiled w/ egcs 1.0.2.  Debug executable
  is a lot smaller which is nice.  Seems to fix some gdb stepping probs we
  were having, too.

  Added help piccy for bomb truck.

  The usual other stuff.

Wed March 25, 1998

-------------------

  Linux Journal put out a good issue this month.  Fav article was Eric
  Raymond's "Helping Netscape Make History," mainly because of an
  included URL to: http://www.earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-b
