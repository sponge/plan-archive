  I've moved to CA, and those of you who know I'm at Transmeta now, you
    prolly grok that I'm about to go into blackout mode.  This is my last
    plan entry.

  Does anyone know the initial sales numbers for Fallout 2?  I've heard
    stories that it's selling out at most retailers.  I'm hoping it is
    selling a lot better than Fallout.

  I don't recommend the movie "Vampires".

  I've just accepted a job with Transmeta.  Thanks to all of those who
    sent me the great job leads.

  I may be hard to reach for a few days, depending on how painful it is to
    connect back up to the net.  We're moving to a friend's apartment
    temporarily.  If you're a phoner & you get "# has changed," just
    dial the new number.  Will try to find some way to check my e-mail.

  I'll be in Dallas today.  If leaving voice or e-mail, plz be
    patient.  I'm already a day behind.  :P

  Nevermind the TV show question.  I see now that you have to write the
    production company to ask for a tape.

  If you miss a TV show aired on a broadcast network, is there a service
    out there you can order from to get a tape of the show?  Seems like half
    the time I program our VCR, I suffer from some kind of brain fart which
    results in recording at the wrong time or getting the wrong channel.
    Thanks.

  Thanks for the replies on the 24-bit color question.  It seems most
    cards support a 32-bit padded byte mode, which is a very good thing,
    though it appears the S3 Virge line doesn't.

  Anyone know whether 24-bit color framebuffers typically have a padding
    byte on each pixel?  I'm talking 2D video cards or 2D/3D video cards,
    but not dedicated 3D accelerators.  I'm looking for confident answers
    and/or hard numbers.  Thanks!
