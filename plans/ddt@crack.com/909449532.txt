  Nevermind the TV show question.  I see now that you have to write the
    production company to ask for a tape.

  If you miss a TV show aired on a broadcast network, is there a service
    out there you can order from to get a tape of the show?  Seems like half
    the time I program our VCR, I suffer from some kind of brain fart which
    results in recording at the wrong time or getting the wrong channel.
    Thanks.

  Thanks for the replies on the 24-bit color question.  It seems most
    cards support a 32-bit padded byte mode, which is a very good thing,
    though it appears the S3 Virge line doesn't.

  Anyone know whether 24-bit color framebuffers typically have a padding
    byte on each pixel?  I'm talking 2D video cards or 2D/3D video cards,
    but not dedicated 3D accelerators.  I'm looking for confident answers
    and/or hard numbers.  Thanks!
