        As we don't have too many peeps here at Crack (8! count 'em!),
        I'm the self-nominated PR Slut and have been spending a lot
        of time the last couple weeks assembling a psuedo-proper press
        e-mail list.  Am now trying to send out regular press releases
        about the Crack development effort on Golgotha.

        Still talking to North American publishers about Golgotha.
        Am thinking on any deal we cut that the title will have
        to publish under the Crack name, as widely unknown as we
        are, because that's what Golgotha will be associated with.
        Overseas publishing will go to individual publishers that are
        best in their territories.  Crack has signed with Octagon to
        manage these publishing relationships.        We plan to master two
        months ahead of release date to give overseas publishers enough
        time to localize all the voice talent in the game to the native
        toungue(s) so that we can get a simultaneous worldwide release.

        Unfortunately, my work logs will be a bit more sparse than the
        others because most business/press work is supposed to remain
        confidential until things are finalized.  Maybe this will change.
        Maybe I will be the one to change it!  Hm.  Maybe I don't want
        Crack to fold.

        Did an online interview today with Online Gaming Review (cool!).
        The whole company showed up on irc, 'cept for Kevin who is on
        vacation.

        Some stuff I can't talk about.
