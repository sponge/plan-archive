We are currently reviewing external candidates for the creation of our
cutscenes. The main requirement is the ability to create realistic,
emotive 3d characters that can express dramatic dialog and perform
believable and frightening action scenes. Skills in creating thematic
and moody sets and post-effects is also required. If you are interested
in working with a creative team on a future high-profile title, please
send demo tapes and work history to:
