Since we've been receiving alot of interest in Vampire's technology lately,
I wanted to confirm that we are indeed making the Nod Engine available for
licensing. We are being somewhat selective about the licensees, so that we
can offer the proper amount of support to the teams that we think will take
full advantage of the engine's capabilities.

Please contact me if you would like an overview of the capabilities and
business terms (only established development teams/publishers will get a
reply on this, sorry!). Thanks-
