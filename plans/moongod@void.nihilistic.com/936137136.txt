I'm very pleased to welcome aboard the 12th member of
Nihilistic Software - Jacob Stephens!
 
Jacob started his career in games at LucasArts in 1996,
after graduating from Penn State University with a
Bachelor of Architecture degree. As part of the
Jedi Knight level design team, he designed and completed
work on eight levels in the game, including the
well-received Level 16: The Falling Ship. Since Jedi,
Jacob has sharpened his design skills creating levels
for Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith, and
Star Wars: Episode I Racer. He's recently been modeling
3D sets for a yet-to-be-announced project at LucasArts.
 
Jacob is taking on the role of Gameplay Technician,
a unique responsibility within our Design group that
straddles both design and implementation of Vampire's
rich form of gameplay. Welcome aboard Jake, we're
honored to have you!
 
Also, thanks to everyone who replied to our search for

received resumes from many diversely talented folks-
