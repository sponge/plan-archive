April 19, 1998:

Dave mentioned I got sick in his .plan.  I hope you guys haven't been
too anxious waiting for these results.  Sorry.. food poisoning.. bleck.
But I'm better now, and back in the saddle again.  :)

Thanks to those of you who sent get well letters and advice on avoiding
food poisoning.  I appreciate the sentiment and goodwill on all parts.

So, 7 of the 9 thunderpad q's have been answered correctly.  I'm still
looking for the correct answers for numbers 1 and 2.  So, in place of
the winners announcement for those two, I've put in a couple of hints.
Good luck.

1.  What's Xen Corp?
hint:  People who have answered have known the correct 'origin' of this
phrase, for the most part, but have guessed at its meaning as it works
in a part of another thing... I'm looking for its -independant- 
significance.

2.  What has 2 legs, no arms, and a cigar?
hint:  from a popular game that I really liked.. first on console, then
on PC.  This is a nasty ol' character on the bad guy side in this GT
title.

3.  What game features Scay'Ger?
Winner: Tester 
Answer:  Incubation 

4.  Who sells the worst BBQ in Texas?
Winner: Dave Stafford
Answer: Rudy's BBQ.  (That's actually their slogan.. weird eh?)

5.  What game features dragons, titans, wizards, golems, skeletons,
    pheonixes, unicorns, genies, ogres, and paladins?
Winner: Prophet
Answer: Heroes of Might and Magic II

6.  What's a Bioderm?
Winner: David Delmont
Answer: Herc pilots from Cyberstorm

7.  Where's Mega-Primus?
Winner: rsecrist
Answer: It's a city on Earth.. the last city left, in fact, in 2084 in
the X-Com universe.

8.  What is the most appropriate answer to this question:  What game
    could be described as the Anti-Ultima?
Winner: Lord Purple
Answer: Dungeon Keeper... you know, you kill the Avatar...
(Gosh, some of you folks are sure MEAN.. >:)

9.  A D-GUN can blow up ________?
Winner: Joseph Fallon
Answer:  Just about anything, from Total Annihilation.

Congratulations to the 7 winners.. still 2 pads to give out, too..
so get in those answers.  As to the seven winners, please email me
with your addresses so I can ship out your prizes.  Also, forgive me,
but I'm not going to be able to respond to each individual submission
for this last contest because there were so many entries.  I hope
you guys understand.  It doesn't mean that I don't love you. 

I'm going to give out some creativity points now... Anthony D'Agostino
gest 25 points for his list of answers which included as an answer to
number 2, what has no arms, two legs, and a cigar as: a detroit hooker.
Hahah.. crack me up!  Also Jason Snyder gets 25 points for his answers
which include as an answer to number 9, a D-GUN can blow up: an A+GUN,
but it can't get in the honor society.  Thanks for making my read
particularly fun. :)

As for work, I've just finished the second draft of the work for the
Ultima demo for E3.  I've got my notes in hand for the third draft, 
and I'm thinking that's going to be the last one.  Wheee!  I should
also be hearing soon if my contract is going to be continued so that
I get to work on the release version of the game.  Keep your fingers
crossed for me.  I like it there.
