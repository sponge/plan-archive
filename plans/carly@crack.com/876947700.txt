October 15, 1997:

Has it really been so long?  I've been a naughty game girl, and I
apologize.  

This is what I've been up to:
I did paperwork.  (AIIIEEEEEEE!!!!)  I'm not saying really what the
paperwork was for.. but it was miserable.  I went through so many 
Crack documents, making photocopies, calling silly people.  It was 
insanity.  But sometimes, such things should and have to be done.

I made a movie!  We had a publisher in the office on Tuesday and I
spent Friday and Monday making a movie.  I'm going to write a batch
file to be released with the demo so that you can all see it.  It's
a _just for fun_ flick.  Enjoy, feel free to send me comments and
or constructive criticisms.. happy to read them, one and all. :)
It even uses the song that Gene sampled my voice for.  

I think it's time for some more points.  We've got the luscious 
Crack.cam operational now, as I'm sure you've all had a look out.
You won't find me in there, not very often anyway.  The coders,
they are so vain.. can you believe it?!  Anyway, if you grab a 
picture you see off Crack Cam, and write a short 25 word or so
amusing story about what you see, I'll award you 50 points, if
they are clever.  10 points just if you do it.  You can enter as
many stories as you like, but you will only be awarded points for
one story.  Cheers!

Some of you may remember I mentioned there was a surprise coming
up and if it worked out I'd let you all in on it.  Well, it worked
out.  Seems my voice will be appearing in the new title, which
some of you may have heard of, Quake II.  (teehee)  Look for
potential Carly sound bites (masterfully and thoroughly hacked
and computerized by the talented American McGee) coming from 
more than one source.  I think I'm the computer, and possibly
the grunting quake girl.  Stay tuned for more excited Carly bits.
