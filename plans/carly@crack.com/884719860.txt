January 13, 1998:

Fragmaster delight on a Saturday Night... Fragykins came up with a 
powerful submission for the artistic representation of Golgotha that
just blew my mind.  LORDY!  If any of you game developers are looking
for artists, you should really check out Frag's work.  I'm going to
put his lovely picture on the site soon, for all to admire.  It's the
density of his passion, his ability to capture the most delicate of
themes and mold them carefully into something new, different, and..
dare I say... alive!  So, congrats to the Frags, for his 200 pt win.

Moving onward.. I've got three programming opportunities for people
seeking points.  Oh yeah.. okay.. the essence of each is the same..
I'm looking for the best graphical effect in each of three categories.

1.  One program, file size not to exceed 2k, to be judged on the basis 
of a graphical display (ie.. a cool graphical effect) which must run 
properly on an Intel Pentium 133 and requires no special hardware 
besides VGA graphics.  Program must run in MS Dos 6.22.  Windows/
Windows95 compatibility is not required.

2.  One program, file size not to exceed 64k, to be judged on the 
basis of a graphical display which runs properly on an Intel P133
and requires no special hardware besides SVGA graphics.  Program 
must be compatible with Windows95, and must run inside a window.

3.  One program, file size not to exceen 64k, to be judged on the
basis of a graphical display which runs properly on an Intel P133
and works on a 3dfx card.  Program must be compatible with
Windows95.

All three contests will be concluded on January 21st.  Each 
category is worth 300 pts and entrants may submit more than one
program if they wish.  The source must be included with the entry.
Source will be inspected by Mack Daddy Programmer Trey Harrison 
for elegance and anything dasterdly that a punk might try.  All 
work is expected to be original.

Now, on the subject of carlypoints.com... I'd like to see some 
design pages regarding ye old site.  If yer interested in 
constructing pages for the site, I'll give ya points.  If yer
pages are better than everyone elses, you'll get mass points
AND your pages will be used.  Yip!  Vito Miliano had some 
terrific ideas for VRML pages, graphically illustrating 
point participants and their current places.  Anything goes
with these pages.. 2d/3d, whatever you want.  The page champion
will recieve 300 points for his/her work.  If you are 
interested in working on pages/maintaining pages, but aren't
interested in competing for it.. let me know and we can work
out a point payment plan for contracted page work.  WOOWOO!
Let's say this contest closes on January 21st as well.

We did an interview today, that was fun.  "Is Golgotha going to
be a huge hit, leaving everything else behind?"  Wow.. uhhhh.
Heh.  That's a hard question to answer.. you can't say yes, 
because then yer a conceited creep.. and you can't say no, because
that just looks bad.  Erp!

Oh well.
