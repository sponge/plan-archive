Hey!  I got a very cool utility from Lord Purple who gets 100 pts for a
simple little Carly Point database he worked up for me.  It's an easy
little guy.. with add, delete, and modify.. but it's fun, and it was
awful nice of him to do.  So I award him with 100 pts for the effort.

Also, it occured to me that other people might write neat utils for
the carlypoint thing.. or for carlypoints.com.  So if that kinda
thing interests you.. I'll award points based on whatever it is you
do, plus for the first program within it's category.. (database, 
etc.) an extra 50 bonus points will be awarded.  So Lord Purple gets
the 50 bonus points for writing the first carlypoints database.  
Hoorah!

I saw Wag the Dog.  Oh man oh man.  I really enjoyed it. Check it out.

Gene's working on a new song.. kinda gregorian.. it's really rad.
He's a fantastic musician.  Oh.. btw.. I think he's offering some
points for a bagpipe sound or something.  Check his .plan.. I've 
endorsed it, it's okay.  :)

Programming and web design contests continue.. don't forget.. >:)
binga bang.
