I'm finally full time on the new engine, ahhh... and
just to liven things up I decided to port the platform
dependant layer of the engine over to the Macintosh and
see how things looked before we made too much more
progress. We were all pleasantly surprised when I had
the engine testbed app up and running after just 2
weeks time. (did I mention this is the first time I've
ever worked on a Mac?) I spent a few minutes today
testing OpenGL compatibility with Mesa OpenGL for the
Mac and experienced no problems (MacG3 with
Voodoo3-2000 and Mesa OpenGL). I'm hoping the ease at
which the platform dependant layer ported to the Mac is
an indication of how simple the Linux port will be.
