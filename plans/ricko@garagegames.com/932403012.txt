The coding for the OpenGL performance upgrade is
virtually done.  Because of the extensive changes that
were required I'm letting QA really pound on this patch
release.  So far everything looks good. You TNT
die-hards will be glad to know that I have removed my
Voodoo2 from my machine and am running exclusively with
a TNT. Starsige runs great, no more hitching and very
respectible framerates.  Next plan I'll report on TNT2
performance.

I've been receiving a few e-mails reguarding Starsiege
not installing on Win2000 beta.  Yes we goofed.
Starsiege runs fine but the installer gets a bit
confused.  We'll have an installer patch available on
the website soon for those who are interested.

A few more hacks have been confirmed and will be
addressed in v1.004.
