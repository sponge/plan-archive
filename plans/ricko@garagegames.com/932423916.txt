Just wanted to clear up a bit of confusion about my
plan update this morning.  I was simply trying to
express my dedication to solving a problem we were
having with TNT based cards and not showing any
personal preference as to what card I prefer to develop
on.

When I'm finished working on the Starsiege patch I'll
be installing Win2000 with multi-monitor support.
Each monitor will be driven by a different leading 3D
accelerator.
