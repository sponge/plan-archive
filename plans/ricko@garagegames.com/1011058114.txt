It is very exciting for me to finally announce the launch of [b]Development Snapshots[/b] here at GarageGames.com.  This has been awhile in the making...while the surface interface to the site is quite simple, I have added a considerable amount of underlying support code to the site to make things like image handling and form processing much simpler.  We had been using PHP´s built-in GD based image handling routines throughout the site but their lack of gif support and incomplete win32 implementation made developing and testing the site a nightmare.  Development Snapshot uses a new set of image handling routines based on [url=http://www.imagemagick.org/]ImageMagick´s[/url] robust collection of image processing tools making our cross platform web development much simpler.

Since there is so much new code it would not surprise me if your guys find a bug or two so if you have any problems while posting your snapshot please copy and error messages from the page and send me an e-mail ([email]webmaster@garagegames.com[/email]) describing what you were doing when the problem occurred.

So, start getting your snapshots and descriptions ready. Posted snapshots will be featured on the Make Games home page for 24 hours and will always be available for viewing in the [url=http://www.garagegames.com/mg/snapshot/gallery.php]gallery[/url]. Images must be Jpeg and no larger than 640x960 pixels.
