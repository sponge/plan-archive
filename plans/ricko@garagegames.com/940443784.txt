I'd like to thank the AMD guys (Brad Craig, Vik Long
and Sam Feng) for taking the time to come up to
Dynamix and giving us the scoop on the Athlon and what
to expect from AMD in the future.  

AMD has always been incredibly supportive on both
the hardware and software side of things.  When we
asked for an Athlon for Tribes2 development, Brad
put in an order for several for us. He appropriated one
of the Athlons from his staff so it would be here the
next day!  Needless to say, with support like that you
can guarantee that Tribes2 will have great custom
tweaked support for the Athlon.  Oh and by the way,
that Athlon he sent rocks!
