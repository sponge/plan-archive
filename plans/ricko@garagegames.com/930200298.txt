As a secondary project we have been working on
additional OpenGL engine changes for Starsiege and
Tribes. The rendering pipeline is fairly optimal as of
Starsiege patch v1.002 but we are still not seeing the
FPS we should be because of poorly written drivers.

The only option remaining to us is to take as much
texture management responsibilities from the driver as
possible.  This is a good and bad thing.  The good is
that it looks like we'll get a generous FPS boost by
micro-managing textures.  The bad is there is no reason
we should have to do this.  Most the hardware available
today can handle many times over the textures we
typically download but the drivers just cannot keep up.
It's sad, there is a lot of great silicon out there
that will never live up to it's potential.  So
micro-managing textures will compensate for driver
inadequacies but will eliminate the possibility of ever
really being able to push the cards to their limit.

So why all this rambling about drivers all of a sudden?
Because I'm thinking of holding onto patch v1.004 for
another week or so and rolling in the OpenGL engine
changes now rather than doing yet another patch.
v1.003 seems very solid and adding the OpenGL changes
to v1.004 will make it a nice package for everyone to
look forward to.

Starsiege Telnet! So there is a little undocumented
feature in Starsiege (and Tribes) that many of you may
be very interested in.  Starsiege supports remote
telnet sessions.  To enable telnet just add the
following lines to your autoexec.cs it's that simple.

$telnetPort = 15000;       // port number
$telnetPassword = mypass;  // password

You can use this for a variety of things: Remote
Administration, write your own ladder monitoring tools
or even extend Starsiege in ways I've never considered.
Have fun if you come up with a unique application send
me some mail and let me know.
