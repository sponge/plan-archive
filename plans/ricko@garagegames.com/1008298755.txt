A minor site update for GarageGames.com tonight and probably a few more behind the scenes updates before the evening is over.  I have integrated a few of the comments we received after the last update - most notably the resizing window for MakeGame is back, yeah!  

I will be more actively developing on the site for the near future so if you have any suggestions, feature requests or find bugs, please let me know.

So why all the changes to the site lately you ask?  Well we are flushing out the PlayGames section of the site for a launch early next year.  PlayGames is the game e-commerce side of GarageGames.com focused on game players and selling your indie game titles.  More on that very soon.
