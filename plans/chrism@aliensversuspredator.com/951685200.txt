Ok Kyle, you want to perpetuate talk about nasty personal habbits?  I'll let everyone know about your nasty habbits if
you're not careful.  :-)  

It looks there might be an end in sight for this nasty mplayer no worky thing.  So keep your eyes here for updates on that.

AVP MAC-

Oh man, get ready all you mac owners, Avp is only steps away from completion.  We've had a version up and running for a
month now that grows more stable by the minute.  

With this Mac version, there have been some speed increases we hope to translate over to the pc as well but no promises.

AVP MAC- 

This has been a bit more work then originally intended. (Did I say that out loud?) What I meant to say was: 

The Mac port is definitely coming it's just that with the new OpenGl support and some problems with texture memory support
in Macs, Logicware has been slaving over cleaning up the code and fixing bugs. A version of the Mac was running a Mac World
and that's the one they reviewed. It wasn't a completed port just a few levels. Anyway, just thought you'd want to know. We
are getting constant updates from them and as soon as we have something worth mentioning, we will. :-) 

P.S. I don't pick my nose, I blow it! 

P.P.S. Maybe twice a week, unless i'm sick :-)

Bad news, We need to delay the screen shot contest for a couple weeks due to some corporate (BS) :-) However, we will come
back with this and many other contests in the near future. 

But I have sort of another contest in mind, have fans of AVP made any progress in creating level editors? Post your reply's
in www.aliensversuspredator.com's forum
