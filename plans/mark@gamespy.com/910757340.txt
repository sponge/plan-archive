[GameSpy 3d 2.05... SmartSpy is here!]

Hey - we've been busy! Tonight we have for your fragging pleasure:

1. GameSpy 3d 2.05
2. GameLaunch 1.0 (yes, it's out of Beta!)
3. Phat new GameSpy website.

1. GameSpy 3d 2.05 is a full public release and it has lots of cool new goodies including:

  * SmartSpy Lists!
 
New Games Added:
  * Blood2 
  * Shogo
  * Heretic2
  * Sin

Also..... We have added a nifty new feature that we call "SmartSpy". Yeah. My fault. Too many cheesy marketing classes. 

SmartSpy allows you to preselect the types of servers that you retrieve from the GameSpy Master Server allowing you to quickly retrieve only the servers you need.  Haven't played in a few days? Just want to play some Rocket Arena?  Rather than retrieving and querying 1000+ servers, simply have GameSpy 3d use a SmartSpy list and retrieve the 100 servers running Rocket Arena 2 and query away!  As more and more game servers are run on the net this is going to be a critical feature. 

2. Gamelaunch 1.0 is finally out. Longest beta test ever? Maybe! 

A ton of bug fixes - an incredible number of new features.  I'm not even sure where to start.
The new Scriptmaster is *amazing*.
New games support includes Sin and Heretic2. 
Huge Congratulations to James "Tetsuo" Katic for continuing to do a great job on GameLaunch. Next up - increased video card support!

3. Gestalt and Mix have have been hard at work on the new GameSpy website..  The GameSpy website is going to be much more of a resource to our wayward brothers and sisters that are new to the world of online mayhem, as well as a good place for you to find the latest mods info. 

Okay - that enough for one update? Go get GameSpy 2.05! http://gamespy.com
