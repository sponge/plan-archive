MP3Spy got the 5 golden cows -

As my friend Dakkon would say "RoX0rs Mc0wNage"

We held a registration party for The Beatdown friday night using MP3Spy.  Really fun stuff - and should be a killer Beatdown this weekend with all the pent up angst!

And I just had to say it:
The only thing I really hate throwing away is keys.  At one point I literally had a bucket of old keys, and I kept thinking, but if I throw one away... what if suddenly I can't open (insert some vital door or lock or something) when I need to because (insert life threatening issue here)? 

So I threw some keys away this weekend when cleaning out my desk. It's still bugging me.

Here's a quick tip: We have an office cat here at GameSpy (we call him Stevens, - VP of Nappy Time).  Stevens used to spend a lot of time sleeping in chairs around the office.  I found this unsatisfying, so I setup a reasonably warm desk lamp on my desk.  Stevens now spends his days on my desk under the lamp. Visitors to the office seem to think that this is quite p1mp.

You can see a picture of Stevens here: http://www.thecomputermechanics.com/gamespy/gamespy.html



4/12/99  12:10 am GameSpy Central Time (but i live somewhere on the net)

We released MP3Spy 1.0 this weekend and it's PHAT CITY and crt is the MAYOR.  MP3Spy is a great little program that is the result of our partnership with NullSoft (the guys and girls that make WinAmp and ShoutCast), and so far everyone, EVEN MIKE WILSON seems to like it.  If you like music GET MP3Spy NOW.

BeatDown approaching ... April 24th, 25th & 26th. Check the website at planetquake.com/beatdown sometime tomorrow when the new website is posted.  My bet is that TFC will be played extensively as that's pretty much all we've been playing for the past month.  Although if there were a kingpin multiplayer demo.....  The TF guys came to the beatdown a while back.. sure wish they'd come again... hint hint.

I went to Electronic Arts in Redwood City on friday and hung out in the l33test conference room I've ever been in.  It defies explanation.  If you get up there ask to meet in either "Eeenie", "Meenie" or "Moe" and don't forget to play with the electronic shades whilst jacking in to the net and ripping into the studio quality sound system and 55" (at least) T.V. And the cookies are good too.  Cool people with really cool shit to play with.  The whole campus is awe inspiring.  Someday..... nah. 

MP3Spy... Would you like fries with that?

GameSpy 2.08 (registered only) is out and has a significant upgrade to the SmartSpy Lists:  They are *much* smaller than their predecessors.  So, what does this mean?  Well... let's say you're querying for the Action Quake2 Servers.  The SmartSpy server 1.0 sent you... oh, about 30k of data.  Now it sends you 1k.   Prior to SmartSpy you would query, oh.... about 2000 servers. Now you query just the 160 AQ servers.  If you're a registered user, grab this sucker!

Two new games were added: Redline from Beyond Games (published by Accolade) and Tribes from Dynamix.  We're getting a lot of email about Tribes...  it's building a really strong following.   Redline is getting raves from the GameSpy email list, so hurry up and check out the demo!

And MP3Spy 1.0 is coming.... *soon*.
