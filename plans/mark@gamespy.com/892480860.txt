GameLaunch Beta2 is now available at www.gamelaunch.com.  *massive* improvements have been made on the user interface and a myriad of cool new features are available... including the ability to save video profiles.  Rock!

As soon as we get to version 1.0 (this week?) we'll begin adding support for more games.  Currently GameLaunch supports:

Quake
Quakeworld
Quake2
Hexen2
Hexen2 Mission Pack
Hexenworld
