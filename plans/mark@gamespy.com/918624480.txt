GameSpy 2.08 (registered only) is out and has a significant upgrade to the SmartSpy Lists:  They are *much* smaller than their predecessors.  So, what does this mean?  Well... let's say you're querying for the Action Quake2 Servers.  The SmartSpy server 1.0 sent you... oh, about 30k of data.  Now it sends you 1k.   Prior to SmartSpy you would query, oh.... about 2000 servers. Now you query just the 160 AQ servers.  If you're a registered user, grab this sucker!

Two new games were added: Redline from Beyond Games (published by Accolade) and Tribes from Dynamix.  We're getting a lot of email about Tribes...  it's building a really strong following.   Redline is getting raves from the GameSpy email list, so hurry up and check out the demo!

And MP3Spy 1.0 is coming.... *soon*.
