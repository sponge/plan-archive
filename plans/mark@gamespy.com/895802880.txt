Now the truth can be told Dept:

GameSpy 2.0 featuring Unreal support will be available either tonight or tomorrow at GameSpy.com!  

The GameSpy team has been working closely with Epic and GT Interactive and have had a working version for several weeks now.  Unreal makes use of the GameSpy master server model and works similarly to Quake Engine games for internet play.

Server administrators should be on the lookout for a patch in (my guess) the next few days from Epic we're still working out a few kinks, but they should be done in time for the the inevitable deluge of Unreal Servers on the net!.  

If you have the Game:
We are running test servers:
unreal.gamespy.com:7777
unreal.gamespy.com:7778
unreal.gamespy.com:7780

Please feel free to connect to these servers and play. 

Server administrators:
Please connect edit your unreal.ini to uplink your servers to unreal.gamespy.com to assist us in testing the new master server.  

Epic/GT have graciously linked to the GameSpy site in the initial pressing of Unreal as a sign of their commitment to awesome internet based gaming. ROCK!!
