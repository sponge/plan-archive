CGDC!
Much to our amazement, GameSpy is going to have a booth at the upcoming Computer Game Developer Conference! May 5-7. We're splurging our hard won registration fees in order to evangelize the Free Internet gaming model utilizing the killer GameSpy as the front end.  This is a big investment for us in terms of time, money and resources.... but I think it will be well worth it.  Several of the large pay for play services will be at CGDC... outspending us by orders of magnitude. I have no doubt that we'll have more fun as well as a larger impact.  GameSpy is kicking the pay-for-play model in the ass. :)  Okay - Enough Hype!

We are going to have a Quake2 challenge at CGDC... and here's the deal:

The challenge is open to all Game Developers. You must have a business card that indicates that you code, make maps, art, etc for an established game developer.  

We'll have 4 p2-300 pc's with a Voodoo2 SLI configuration for you to play on.  

Your mission, should you choose to accept it:
Form a 2 man team and then beat 2 PlanetQuake staffers (most likely Fargo, Bastard or Dweomer) in a best of 9 rocket arena match. 

Your prize?  A spanky Voodoo2 board.  Each.  Shut us out and take home 2 Voodoo2 boards. Each. SLI baby. SLI!!

You can make games... but have you been too busy to play them?  Let's find out. CGDC.  GameSpy booth... right next to the online living room.  Come get some coder boy.  Booth #1653


BTW, even if you suck at Quake II, stop by. We have all kinds of cool stuff to give out and together we can hatch a master plan for turning the online gaming industry on it's head! Rock!

GameSpy 3d 2.00 Beta 2 is now available!  Registered users should run to www.gamespy.com and grab this thing.  This is most likely the final beta before we release the final.  The feedback continues to be that GameSpy 2.0 is truly an excellent product.

GameLaunch 1.0 Beta 3 is also available at www.gamelaunch.com.  This too is the likely final beta.  Run, don't walk and check out this killer product.  Overwhelmingly it's described as a "god-send" and as "a miracle".  I won't go that far, but hey, I use it 10 times a day.... and you will too!
