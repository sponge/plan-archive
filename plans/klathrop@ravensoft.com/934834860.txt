August 16-

Welllllll...this weekend I went to the company picnic to enjoy fun, recreational activities with my co-workers and their families, eat tasty catered food, and drink beer.  Got to do all three.  Then got locked in the observation tower of the park shelter by some moron park worker.  Y'know, is it too much to ask to have the guy go to the top of the stairs and CHECK IF ANYONE IS STILL UP THERE?  Or at least call up the stairs, "HELLO?  IS ANYONE STILL UP THERE?"  Gee, I guess that's just too much effort.  Time to start drug-testing potential park employee applicants.  On the bright side, all of my friends and co-workers who were still at the picnic stuck by and made sure that I had everything I needed until I was freed-- beer, smokes, love and compassion.  Well, okay, beer and smokes.  There were too many jokes being made and pictures being taken to qualify as 'love and compassion'. ;)  Special thanks goes out to Denise, the lovely young police officer who saw to it that I was freed from my strange prison.  She is truly one of Madison's Finest! :)
