10/3/98 -

I recently read with some amusement Andrew Smith's editorial
on PlanetQuake - "The Weight of Silence".  I think it's perfectly
reasonable and important for consumers to complain when a product
they've purchased doesn't live up to the claims of the manufacturer.
However, suggesting that a company is lying to consumers about a
product that hasn't been released is pushing it a little far.

In his article, Andrew says that Activision and Id are misleading
consumers with their press release stating that Quake Arena will
include "striking improvements that will enhance the single player
game for the ultimate in 3-D entertainment".  Now, nevermind the
fact that the press release explicitly says that it contains
"forward-looking statements", but the fact is that if Id and 
Activision intend to enhance single-player, it's very hard to
make a judgement call until we see the end result.  Even then,
it's still a matter of opinion whether the changes resulted in
an improvement.

If Id suggested that 30 people could play via a single machine 
and didn't, in the end, deliver on that statement, then I'd agree
that they misled people.  Or, if they suggested it would magically
improve your sex life, then yeah, there's a problem.  But, when a
game is still in production and we have no evidence to show that
they have no intention to fulfill that promise, just sit back and
play some of the other fine games that have been released and
figure out if those games live up to what the developer promised.
I've heard the Sin demo is good, why not try it? ;)
