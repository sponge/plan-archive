It's been a long time since I updated my .plan, so
I thought I'd give a brief update.

I haven't said anything about GLDoom in a while, and that's
because I'm knee-deep in working on Sin.  Needless to say, I'm
no longer working on it.  It was pretty much a mistake for me
to try to get involved in a side project that could never hold
as much importance to me as Sin does.  Besides, Bruce Lewis is
doing a great job on his version of GLDoom.  :)  If you haven't
heard about Bruce's version yet, go to http://www.frag.com/doom
to read about it.

I'm just wrapping up a major rewrite of the "event" system in Sin.
Events are our method of schedule actions to occur within the game.
The rewrite combines events and script commands, which gives level
designers direct control over the behaviour of all objects within
the game, without adding special script commands.

The script system has grown to be much more powerfull than I
originally planned it to be.  The original goal of the scripts
were to eliminate alot of the drudgery of creating interactive
elements in the levels, but has grown to allow the creation of
very complex behaviour.  The stuff Charlie Wiederhold is currently
working on approaches the complexity of a QuakeC mod.

The thing about the script language that I'm most proud of is
the fact that it acts to complement the game .DLLs and not as a
replacement for them.  The scripts provide a lot of functionality
that would be difficult or tedious to do in program code.  I'm
eager to see what the user community does with them.

As far as the BBQ on Sunday goes, it's interesting that some of the
folks complaining about people "wasting" there time playing old
Atari games were inside playing guitar or Tron most of the afternoon
before the Atari was even plugged in.  At least M.U.L.E. allowed
4 players to play. :)
