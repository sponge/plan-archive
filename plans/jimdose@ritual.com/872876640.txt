8/29/97 -

I thought I'd update on what's going on with the OpenGL port
of Doom.  Sin is, of course, my top priority, so this is really
a project I do on Sundays.  I offered to do the port partly as
an exercise in developing for OpenGL and partly because I really
want to play the game with the nice blending features of 3D
hardware.  I thought the N64 version of Doom was beautiful, 
but playing Doom without a mouse just isn't the same.

I've got a version running in a window treating the game 
screen as a texture and uploading it to OpenGL each frame.  
This is slow as hell, but my first goal was to get it working 
in Windows without any changes to the renderer.  There's 
still some problems with fullscreen mode and hardware, so 
that's my task for this weekend.  Mark helped out considerably 
with the window code by finding some bug that I had with
getting OpenGL to draw to a windows bitmap.

After getting the boring Windows stuff done I'll start converting
the vertical span based rendering to full polygons.  This is the
"get down to business" part of the job, so I'll probably have to
try a few different methods to get the best performance.

Once I've got the renderer taking advantage of OpenGL, I'll
add some of the cool things that hardware gives you basically
for free.  The sprite explosions, the BFG blast, and the plasma
gun's projectiles will all be done using alpha blending.  I'll
probably do some light sourcing with light maps around the light
posts.  The walls next to floor and ceiling light textures will
blend from light to dark.  I also want to put in true looking up
and down.  Even though the game doesn't take advantage of it,
it would still be nice to mlook. :)
