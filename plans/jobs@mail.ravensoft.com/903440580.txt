***WELCOME TO THE RAVEN WANT ADS***

1/3 less fat than other .plan files!

In this .plan, we are placing openings for positions that we are looking 
	to fill.  The person that you should contact will be listed in the ad.

Good luck to all!
 
*******************************************************************************
		***ATTENTION ANIMATORS!!***

	I would like to make contact with character animators who 
	would be interested in working for Raven Software.  Raven 
	is not looking to fill a position immediately, but there is 
	room if the right person comes along.  First and foremost 
	we are looking for people who have strong character animation 
	capabilities, either as traditional cel animators or as 3D 
	animators.  Knowledge of a specific software or computer 
	system is not the most important quality we are looking for.  
	We are willing to train the right person.  

	If you are interested, please email your resume to:

		     bpelletier@mail.ravensoft.com
 
	Make the subject "resume."

*******************************************************************************
		***ATTENTION PROGRAMMERS***

	Here's what we are looking for:
	1. A programmer who has prior experience in the gaming industry.
				-or-
	2. Someone who has a background in programming,	and codes games
		for fun since they see the industry as unattainable.  
		(We can make it attainable.) ;)
				-or-
	3. Someone who has taken the time to make some cool TC's and mods
		for the Quake technology, especially Quake II.

	This is a full time position, and you have to be old enough to 
	work a full time job.  Also, we don't want telecommuting,
	so you would also have to move to Madison, WI, the land of beer,
	milk, and cheese.  We are also looking to hire someone soon, 
	so please get your resumes and mail in now!
 
	What exactly do you need to send us?

	Well, what we would really like to see is a short resume/bio
	and either some sample code or a little game that you made
	or an awesome Quake mod that you developed.

	Oh yeah, where should I send my stuff?

	If you want to be a programmer, send it to Mike Crowns,
	our director of product development.  His e-mail is 
	mcrowns@mail.ravensoft.com

*******************************************************************************
		***ATTENTION DESIGNERS***

	Here's what we are looking for:

	ONE Quake engine map (Quake, Quake II, Hexen 2)
	Balanced for single player, deathmatch, and cooperative
	Choose the one level that best shows off your style and flair.
	Zip it up and send it to me.  Please, don't ask me to download 
	it since I already have so much other stuff going on.  Please, no CTF 
	or net only maps.

	Like the programmer position, this is a full time job and would require
	the employee to move to Madison, WI.  We would also like to see a 
	short bio/resume that highlights your creativeness and your
	past experience in gaming.  This could be anything from levels
	that you have made at home to games that you have made professionally.
 
	If you have something that you would like me to check out,
	zip it up and send it to Eric Biessman (ebiessman@mail.ravensoft.com)
