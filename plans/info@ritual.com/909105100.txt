It's out folks!!  You must have a Pentium 150 with 32megs of RAM to play. 
A 3D accelerator isn't required, but the demo has support for 3Dfx, Rendition
PowerVR, and NVidia.  

Look for it at our website:

-[ Sin Full Release Date ]-

The official date is "When it's done."  Software developement isn't an exact
science, so we can't pinpoint a date.  We're working hard and it shouldn't
be too long now.
