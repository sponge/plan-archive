Position:  Blood 2 Project Lead / Lead Game Designer

Just a quick update.  The demo is pretty much done on the content side, and is very cool.  We're just working out a few of the bugs.  Should be released very soon, definitely by the weekend.  We've got an army of GT muscle ready to promote it for us, so once it goes up it should be available from a large number of sources.  That's it. :)

Ack!  Too many e-mails!  Must finish Blood 2!

Thanks for all the votes of confidence, I really appreciate it!  But I must now request a moment of silence to get this bad boy out the door. :)
