So now I'm writing a FD P3D -> .SHADER converter, looks like it should be
trivial.

Okay, people keep sending me car suggestions, so let me clarify some things.
First, and most importantly, I have a limited budget.  Suggestions of Ferrari
F50, McLaren F1, and 550 Maranello are appreciated, however those vehicles
cost $750K, $1M, and $230K respectively.  My Viper has an MSRP of $66.5K.  They
are, quite simply, in VERY different leagues.

That said, I'll run through various pros-and-cons of all the other cars
suggested to me.  Remember that how a car performs in real life is very
different than how well it does in a magazine review or a press release.

- Brabus/RennTech Mercedes SL

Fast, WAY overpriced for what you get.  Comfy, but not very exotic looking.

- Lotus Esprit Turbo V8

Fast, but looks kind of dated.  Within price range, but it's a British
car, and British cars have a reputation for being horribly unreliable.

- Aston Martin DB

Ugly.  British cars have a reputation for being horribly unreliable.  Not
very fast.

- Jaguar XK

Ugly.  British cars have a reputation for being horribly unreliable.  Not
very fast.

- Jaguar XJ220

Not available in US.  Extremely large vehicle.  Six cylinder engine.

- Ferrari 456 GT

Expensive.  Looks boring.  Four seater.

- Ferrari 550 Maranello

Expensive.  Looks like a Toyota Supra.

- Nissan's GT1 car

Expensive.  Not being built.

- Ferrari F50

Expensive.  Difficult to acquire right now.

- McLaren F1

Expensive.  Difficult to find parts.  Difficult to import.  Heat problems at
low speeds (<50mph).

- Bugatti EB110

Bugatti is out of business.

Irk.  Well, Shader looks like it's pretty much toast.  The main reason is 
because Fractal Design Painter 3D does everything Shader did, but much 
much much better.  I wish I had known about P3D two months ago, but oh
well, better to find out now than later. *sigh*

Other cars:

- Acura NSX

Nice looking, in a homogenous, boring kind of way.

Slow, slow, and did I mention - slow?  Also overpriced.

- Mercedes SL5/600

Nice looking, well built, comfy.

Slow, not very exotic, very expensive for what you get.

I'm familiar with the Hennessey mods, but I won't get my car modified
for at least another 9 months.

Oh, I also read Po Bronson's "The First 20 Million is Always the Hardest" and
I think it's pretty amusing, and vaguely sort of accurate.

Zakk sent in another CTF "duh" kind of rule: if you and a teammate are running
towards each other, STRAFE RIGHT!  The number of times I've been killed by
running into my own teammate as we try and pass each other while I'm being
chased is uncountable.

I'm reading "Soul of a New Machine", it's been REAL good so far, very
accurate, even if it's dated for its material (it's about a renegade group
of engineers within Data General back in the '70s).  Non-fiction, highly
recommended.

If you're a writer, you REALLY need to pick up a copy of Strunk & White's
"Elements of Style" and read it.  A lot.

Next on my list of books to read are:

"Accidental Empires" 
that Joe Montana book on quarterbacking
"Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand

Anyone know why Dameyune Craig isn't being touted in the draft?  Is he
missing something fundamental?  He wasn't even invited to the combine.  I think
he may be a steal in the later rounds.

Accelerating a Viper in 1st while turning is a Bad Idea.  No damage, but
that was my first real scare in that car.

Viper Rule #4: If you have to punch it to merge with traffic, just wait.

I'm a CTF freak, as anyone that plays on satan:27913 would know.  Some 
comments:

CTF STRATEGY

A CTF Strategy Guide should be required reading before you play.  I've seen
so many people just treat the game as a free-for-all w/ grapple instead of
an actual team game.  Common mistakes include:

- grabbing health and armor in front of your flag carrier
- not escorting your
