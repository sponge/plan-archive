December 13, 1997 (part 2)
------------------

Every now and then a beast walks the landscape and devours all within its path,
knowing no natural enemy.  These are the things of legend: Michael Jordan,
Walter Payton, the great white shark, early Mike Tyson, and...

3DFX, ca. 1997

I've said this before and I'll say it again -- I left 3Dfx for a reason, and
it didn't have anything to do with wanting to branch out and expand my
horizons.  It had to do with the fact that I thought 3Dfx was confused and had
a severe lack of management and direction.  So when I say good things about
3Dfx, it's not because I love that company or anything -- sure, I have some
stock in 3Dfx, but the amount I have is a pittance (I negotiated poorly for
stock, and I left after only 1/4 of it vested), so I don't have a financial
reason to like 3Dfx.

If I say good things about 3Dfx, it's because their hardware rocks like no 
other hardware company can dream of.  I empathize with their situation -- 
they make what is  arguably the single most important piece of consumer PC 
hardware since the SoundBlaster, and all we keep hearing about are all the 
"Voodoo Killers" that are gonna show up "any day now".  I cannot stress to 
the world what kind of an amazing achievement the Voodoo was/is -- it easily 
spanked it's nearest competitor by a factor of three, which is practically
unheard of.  Typically when looking at performance claims between hardware 
it's impressive to see someone listed as "25% faster".  But THREE HUNDRED 
PERCENT?!

That, my friends, is amazing.  And yet at times I STILL think people are
constantly looking at the horizon wondering what's going to be the "Voodoo
Killa", instead of appreciating the magnitude of what Scott Sellers, Gary
Tarolli, and Jim Margeson accomplished.

id had to hear the same noise after Quake when all the "Quake killers" were
gonna show up and even the landscape....sure, there were pretty screenshots
and big performance claims and projected release dates, but when it came down
to it, the first Quake killer to ship was...Quake 2.

It must be nice being a competitor of 3Dfx, since it's easy to aim for that
plume of dust they're leaving in their trail.

"So, what's the big deal?" you may ask.  Why the big 3Dfx Cheerleading all of
a sudden?

To answer that, let's just say "I ran the numbers".  But first, let us
establish some things:

1.  The test system, as I mentioned the other day, is a pretty big, macked
out, p1mped up system from hell.  It's an HP Pavilion 8190 Pentium 2/300 with
AGP, 6GB HDD, some kind of soundcard (disabled for testing), etc. etc.  A
pretty nice system.  Oh, and 96MB of RAM.

2.  Now, please do NOT send me mail whining that this system is not indicative
of what everyone has.  I KNOW this already.  But if I test on a Pentium/200MMX,
people are gonna complain that they don't know what kind of p1mped out new
system to get, or they'll complain that my test system should match our
minimum requirements.  If I test on a P5/133, people are gonna complain, once
again, that they don't know what kind of NEW system to get, or they'll complain
that I'm testing CPU performance, not hardware performance.

3.  Yes, certain accelerators are very dependent on CPU performance.  If I had
a P5/133, I would NOT get a PowerVR or a RIVA128 -- these two chipsets are
real dependent on CPU performance, more so than their competitors.

4.  A Pentium 2 was pretty much needed because I wanted to test AGP parts along
with PCI parts.  Also, some chips like the RIVA128 are going out standard on a
lot of Pentium 2 machines, so NVidia will have a (valid) argument that if I
test a RIVA on a P90 that this is NOT typical of a RIVA in the field.

So, I know I can't make everyone else happy, but I CAN make myself happy.  I'm
sure other people will run the benchmarks on lower end systems and print their
results, so all is not lost.

5.  These numbers, and chipset opinions, are GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE
OF GLQUAKE.  This may seem like common sense, but I KNOW some people are going
to whine that the numbers are lower than GLQUAKE's, so please...don't.  Also,
the performance dependencies of Quake2 are significantly different than that of
GLQuake -- we have lots more triangles going on, and I believe a lot more
textures.  This means that boards that work great with GLQuake (e.g. PowerVR
PCX2) aren't so hot with Quake2, and vice versa (Permedia2 is arguably a better
board for Quake2 than Quake because its triangle setup performance makes up for
its poor fill-rate).

Tests were run 640x480 and 512x384, fullscreen, at 16bpp resolution, with
sound disabled, using "sync to retrace" disabled if at all possible.  Tests
were run twice, and the best of the two scores was recorded.  I did not get
a chance to test the ATI Rage Pro because I don't have NT installed -- all
the more reason to see these guys support an ICD -- and I did not get a 
chance to test the Rendition V2100 boards since they don't seem to work with
the V2200 software Rendition provided.  I used DEMOMAP DEMO1.DM2 to run 
the test.  I also did not exec ANY configs, since this can throw off figures
if you inadvertently set "hand 2" or something.  All tests were performed
under Win95 OSR 2.1 with no other applications running.  Occasionally I would
run a test at higher resolution "just because".

As a "control" number I ran the test in software, fullscreen, using DirectDraw
on the Permedia2.

No overclocking of any type was done, and I did not run any "tweaks".  I'm
trying to represent the type of performance Joe User would get if he bought his
system at CompUSA, grabbed some add-in board (if necessary), then went home
and played.
