Spent today going to dinner, doing e-mail, and trying to run more benchmarks.
Unfortunately we've been having serious problems trying to get stuff up and
running.  Still haven't managed to get our V2100 or V2200 Rendition boards
up and running, hopefully that's a driver problem.  Still haven't got the
NVidia RIVA128's ICD up and running either, waiting on new drivers from them.
Haven't tested the Canopus Pure3D yet, due to lack of time, but that'll 
hopefully get the treatment tomorrow.

However, we DID get the Voodoo2 up and running, both in SLI and standalone
mode and all I have to say is OH MY GOD.  Uh, ouch, it would suck to be one
of 3Dfx's competitors right now.  This chipset rocks.  The numbers are
just incredible, and through much of base1 you're zipping around at 60fps.

Quake2 is a different game at 60fps.  Period.  You can see everything with
a very eery, silken clarity.  Particles look like they're flowing through
the air instead of flying through the air.  Rockets look distinct instead of
like hazy blurs.

Anyway, onto other stuff...

Here is a pet peeve of mine with the Microsoft Developer Studio debugger.  How
am I supposed to look at N items of an array?!  For example, if I have a
pointer to an array of floats being passed to a function the debugger has no
idea how many elements are in the source array so it only shows the first one,
and there is no way (that I know of) to look at a bunch of them, especially
if I want to look at several array simultaneously.

Yes, I can look at the memory watch window, that is an ugly mess that is
complete unintuitive.  The Borland debugger that I used to use would let
simply specify something like this:

p,50

Where "50" is the number of elements.  That is SO cool.  The MSDEV memory
watch window won't let you look at more than one thing at a time.

Oh yeah, while I'm bitching about MSDEV, what is SO difficult about doing a
cross compiler?!  Why do I have to unass myself from my chair and walk to a DEC
Alpha machine to generate a DEC Alpha executable?!  GCC has had this for
decades.

Oh geez, I'll test the Canopus Pure3D already! :-) I don't think the Pure3D's
performance advantage is going to manifest itself in a TIMEDEMO, but I DO think
it will still _feel_ faster than a 4MB 3Dfx board because it won't swap as
many textures.  Unfortunately, this texture swapping often doesn't show up in
a TIMEDEMO, it only manifests itself as a few REALLY slow frames, which feel
horrible but don't affect TIMEDEMO scores that drastically.

But to be thorough, I'll go ahead and test one of these puppies.

I ran the first set of benchmark tests tonight.  The test system is an Intel
Pentium 2 AGP system w/ 64MB of RAM.  The operating systems are Win95 OSR 2.1
and WinNT 4.0 SP3.  The boards that I'm testing are:

- 3Dfx Voodoo2 SLI PCI (3Dfx Voodoo2, dual TMU, SLI)
- Quantum3D Obsidian XS-100 4440 (3Dfx Voodoo, dual TMU, SLI)
- 3Dfx Voodoo2 PCI (3Dfx Voodoo2, dual TMU)
- 3Dfx Voodoo PCI (3Dfx Voodoo, dual TMU)
- Diamond Monster3D (3Dfx Voodoo)
- STB Velocity 128 PCI (NVidia RIVA128)
- Diamond Viper 330 AGP (NVidia RIVA128)
- ATI Rage Pro 3D AGP (ATI Rage Pro)
- 3DLabs Permedia 2 AGP (3DLabs Permedia2)
- PowerVR PCX2 PCI (PCX2)
- Rendition V2200 PCI (Rendition V2200)
- Diamond Stealth 3D PCI (Rendition V2100)
- Intergraph Realizm PCI
- Voodoo Rush PCI (Voodoo Rush w/ 6MB)

Boards notably absent, and likely not to be tested because of prior poor
performance:

- Pyramid3D-based boards
- Number Nine Imagine128

I'm also going to pass on testing the Canopus, since it likely won't have
significantly better measurable performance

Yes, I'm well aware that
