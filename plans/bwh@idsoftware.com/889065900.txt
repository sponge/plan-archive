INSTALLMENT 3:

ENJOY WHAT YOU DO AND NEVER SELL OUT

This is the point at which I start sounding like your parents or, more 
specifically, like certain of my friends talking to me.  Since I ignored both 
my parents and my friends' advice, I figure you'll ignore my advice too, but 
what the hell, I figure I'll give it a shot anyway.

With both your job and your life you have to avoid selling out and taking the 
easy, comfortable, convenient, and safe route.  Figure out what it takes for 
you to be happy, not just content and comfy, because life is too damn short 
to settle for just "okay".

This philosophy applies across the board: from life, love, and friendships, 
all the way to your career.  We've all seen friends stuck in dead-end 
relationships (with girlfriends, boyfriends, jobs, whatever) simply because 
they refused to suffer a little grief and take a little financial or emotional
risk long enough to search for real happiness.  A lot of this is because many 
people fundamentally feel lucky just to be not unhappy, which is a pretty 
fucked up attitude when you really think about it - I mean, go ahead and 
appreciate what you have, and never take it for granted, but never think you 
don't deserve to be more than just "not unhappy".

* Time and Happiness are Far More Important than Comfort, Money, and Sex *

You can always make more money, you can always find another lover, but you 
can never reclaim wasted time.  I'm sure some of you have been in a bad 
situation that, once you're finally removed from it, you end up saying to
yourself, "Jeez, why the hell didn't I do that a long time ago?  If only I 
could have that wasted time back!"

Problem is, you can never get that time back.  The best you can do is learn 
from your mistakes and move on.  One of the biggest things I've learned the 
past few years is that the minute you know, without a doubt, that you're 
in a bad or pointless situation, do NOT enter loser denial and drag it out 
forever because of a fear of failure, a fear of confrontation, or a fear of 
being on your own.  It's like a band-aid - rip it off, get it over with, and 
move on.

* Save Money, Avoid Debts, and Don't Get Stuck with a Job Because of the Pay *

So applying this to your career -- save enough money so that you can quit your 
job whenever you feel it's no longer what's best for you.  Don't accrue huge 
debts that lock you into a job that you may not be happy with.  Try and save 
money so that if you're unemployed for a few months you'll still be okay.  I 
make enough money right now to
