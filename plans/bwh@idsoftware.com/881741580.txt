December 10, 1997 (early AM)
------------------

I ran the first set of benchmark tests tonight.  The test system is an Intel
Pentium 2 AGP system w/ 64MB of RAM.  The operating systems are Win95 OSR 2.1
and WinNT 4.0 SP3.  The boards that I'm testing are:

- 3Dfx Voodoo2 SLI PCI (3Dfx Voodoo2, dual TMU, SLI)
- Quantum3D Obsidian XS-100 4440 (3Dfx Voodoo, dual TMU, SLI)
- 3Dfx Voodoo2 PCI (3Dfx Voodoo2, dual TMU)
- 3Dfx Voodoo PCI (3Dfx Voodoo, dual TMU)
- Diamond Monster3D (3Dfx Voodoo)
- STB Velocity 128 PCI (NVidia RIVA128)
- Diamond Viper 330 AGP (NVidia RIVA128)
- ATI Rage Pro 3D AGP (ATI Rage Pro)
- 3DLabs Permedia 2 AGP (3DLabs Permedia2)
- PowerVR PCX2 PCI (PCX2)
- Rendition V2200 PCI (Rendition V2200)
- Diamond Stealth 3D PCI (Rendition V2100)
- Intergraph Realizm PCI
- Voodoo Rush PCI (Voodoo Rush w/ 6MB)

Boards notably absent, and likely not to be tested because of prior poor
performance:

- Pyramid3D-based boards
- Number Nine Imagine128

I'm also going to pass on testing the Canopus, since it likely won't have
significantly better measurable performance

Yes, I'm well aware that the test system we have is a little on the high-end
side, but I simply don't have time to run all these benchmarks in all these
iterations on multiple systems.  I'm going to be testing performance at 16bpp
resolution, 24bpp when available, in gl_modes 2, 3, and 4 (512, 640, and
800, respectively).  When possible I will disable/enable VSYNC, and I run
all the tests in fullscreen.  The tests are also going to be run using DEMO1
distributed with Quake2.

Right now we're waiting on new drivers from several vendors.  Today I managed
to test the NVidia PCI & AGP w/ their MCD, a regular 4MB Voodoo, the Quantum3D
Obsidian board, the Voodoo Rush, the Permedia2 using their ICD, the PCX2, and
the Realizm (in a Pentium Pro 200 w/ 128MB of RAM).  Tomorrow I hope to test
the NVidia PCI & AGP w/ their ICD, the Voodoo2 SLI, the Voodoo2 non-SLI, and
the Rendition stuff.  By the end of the week I hope to test the dual-TMU
Voodoo.

This should be interesting stuff...I can't give out any REAL big info, but I
will say that the slowest so far has been 10.8fps and the fastest is over
30fps -- quite a spread!  I'm fairly certain that the slowest board has been
tested already, and that the fastest board has not.

Will keep you folks posted.

More ranting:

I think that being able to have a social life via the net is a GOOD thing, not
a bad thing.  There are a lot of people in this world that don't have the time,
inclination, or ability to meet others like them.  Being able to log onto an
IRC channel or onto a Web site with a message board and talk to dozens or
hundreds of people with similar hobbies (gardening, stock market, Quake,
games, whatever) cannot be seen as anything BUT a good thing.  Finding someone
else in your town who happens to have the same set of hobbies as yourself
is very difficult, no matter how cool you are or how much free time you have,
unless you're in school where you're FORCED to meet tons of strangers all the
time.

My only complaint is when people use the net as an escape -- it's like
alcohol, you can use it for fun or you can use it as an escape.  The former
is "social drinking",
