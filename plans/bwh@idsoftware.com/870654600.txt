July 3, 1997
------------------

After long discussions with Chris Hecker I've decided to try and use more
industry standard extensions instead of trying to do stuff specific for 
Quake2.  Right now we're interested in the following types of extensions:

- multitexture
- paletted texture
- particle systems

For the multitexture stuff the SGI stuff looks like it may not suck, but
until I mess with it some I may not know for sure.

I'd like to use the glColorTableEXT that is part of the OpenGL for Win32.
I'm going to talk to 3DLabs and 3Dfx as to why they each did not support
this extension to make sure there aren't some technical foibles behind it.

I think that we may be able to use the SGI glPointParameterfSGI extension
for particle systems.  It's not _ideal_ for what we'd like to do, but I
think it's good enough.  It allows us to specify a min and max size for
scaled particles, and it allows us to change the size of particles via
the standard glPointSize API.  It also scales over distance, etc.

Next week I'll mess with this stuff some more, since the software renderer
is pretty much up to speed.  I'll also be spending the end of next week getting
SciTech Software's MGL code reintegrated into Quake2.

The movie itself was "eh".
