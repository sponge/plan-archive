Other cars:

- Acura NSX

Nice looking, in a homogenous, boring kind of way.

Slow, slow, and did I mention - slow?  Also overpriced.

- Mercedes SL5/600

Nice looking, well built, comfy.

Slow, not very exotic, very expensive for what you get.

I'm familiar with the Hennessey mods, but I won't get my car modified
for at least another 9 months.

Oh, I also read Po Bronson's "The First 20 Million is Always the Hardest" and
I think it's pretty amusing, and vaguely sort of accurate.

Zakk sent in another CTF "duh" kind of rule: if you and a teammate are running
towards each other, STRAFE RIGHT!  The number of times I've been killed by
running into my own teammate as we try and pass each other while I'm being
chased is uncountable.

I'm reading "Soul of a New Machine", it's been REAL good so far, very
accurate, even if it's dated for its material (it's about a renegade group
of engineers within Data General back in the '70s).  Non-fiction, highly
recommended.

If you're a writer, you REALLY need to pick up a copy of Strunk & White's
"Elements of Style" and read it.  A lot.

Next on my list of books to read are:

"Accidental Empires" 
that Joe Montana book on quarterbacking
"Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand

Anyone know why Dameyune Craig isn't being touted in the draft?  Is he
missing something fundamental?  He wasn't even invited to the combine.  I think
he may be a steal in the later rounds.

Accelerating a Viper in 1st while turning is a Bad Idea.  No damage, but
that was my first real scare in that car.

Viper Rule #4: If you have to punch it to merge with traffic, just wait.

I'm a CTF freak, as anyone that plays on satan:27913 would know.  Some 
comments:

CTF STRATEGY

A CTF Strategy Guide should be required reading before you play.  I've seen
so many people just treat the game as a free-for-all w/ grapple instead of
an actual team game.  Common mistakes include:

- grabbing health and armor in front of your flag carrier
- not escorting your flag carrier
- not clearing enemies out of your base while your flag carrier is trying not
  to get killed
- leaving the base undefended
- getting engaged in pointless 1-v-1 battles -- killing the enemy doesn't
help that much unless you're denying them a tech item or unless you're clearing
out an area.
- if you're lagged, do NOT BECOME THE FLAG CARRIER!

CAMPING IS COOL

FOV 30 + railgun + sensitivity 1.0 = angel of death.  Do NOT get in a railgun
match with a 0-ping guy with resistance + armor. :-) Railgun + double damage
equals instant death.

Snipers work in pairs, a spotter/close-in person to defend the sniper while
the sniper is doing his/her thing.  The Stronghold is bad that way -- you can
get in the sniper zone while someone walks up behind you and puts a blaster to
your head.  You need sniper teams on that level.  But one sniper team can 
easily kill one person every 15 seconds and keep that area clear.

TECHS

The Autodoc is a little too powerful, should probably not refresh the armor I
think.

The Shield isn't powerful enough.

BFG SUCKS FOR CTF

That's just my opinion, but it really isn't fun when some no-talent just hops
in the water, grabs a BFG + cells, then clears out the base in three shots.

SPECTATORS ON SATAN SUCK

There is a HUGE line of people trying to get on Satan at any given time, so if
you're spectating you're preventing someone else from playing.  When I'm on I'm
pretty insistent that spectator play or leave.

PEOPLE THAT QUIT PLAYING BUT STAY CONNECTED SUCK

Even MORE annoying are people that play the game, then have to go to the
bathroom or get a drink or answer the phone and don't disconnect.  They take
up a valuable slot just sitting there, but since the line is so long to get
on Satan people don't want to disconnect because they might not get on 
again.  That sucks.

If I'm playing and someone is just standing on a spawn spot and doesn't respond
to a hail, I kick them.

Someone else asked "Why not the M3?"

Pros:

- pretty fast
- "sleeper" appeal
- not very expensive (relatively speaking)
- seats 4 comfortably

Cons:

- 15% of id employees already have a black M3
- Cash's M3 is having a supercharger installed
- not exotic enough

I probably knew I was getting a Viper a long time ago when Carmack said to
me many months ago:  "You should get a Viper, it suits your personality."
 
People have pointed out (with varying degrees of politeness) that if I truly
wanted to comment about upcomingn products based solely on available 
information that I would mention the PVR NG (or whatever it's called).  Since
I don't, this shows my "obvious" bias against PowerVR.

Simply put, the NDA we have signed with PowerVR has specifically forbidden us
to talk about ANYTHING to do with their upcoming hardware and development
kits without written permission first.  I ain't writing for permission to 
say shit, so instead I'm not saying anything.

One thing I neglected to mention earlier was that I was really happy with
my scores because of other factors:

- I hadn't driven a stick shift in almost 10 years
- I picked up the car on Monday
- the drag strip was the first time I've EVER just revved a car and popped
the clutch

In other words, I'm not the most experienced driver in the wor
