April 20, 1998

Damn, I am up WAY too early.  I've had this bad tendency lately of getting up
at about 8AM, deciding it's too early, then falling back asleep for two hours,
which throws off my schedule (I'd optimally like to get up at about 9 so that
I'm at work by around 9:30 or 9:45).  So today I got up at eight and stayed
awake.  Now I'm debating if that was really a good idea.

I thought I had my compulsive spending habits under control, and for the
most part I do, but I really splurged again when I probably shouldn't have,
but what the hell, why do I work these hours if I'm not gonna spend the money
I make? :-) (Yes, the rationalizations come quick and easy for me).

So I'm giving Don, a.k.a. "Onethumb", a demo of my pimp KEF Q75 UniQ speakers,
and during the beginning of "The Fifth Element" my left speaker blows up.  Oh
wonderful.  British speakers...British cars...hmmm....

So I go back to the Home Theater Store on Preston, and they don't have a new
one in the warehouse they can exchange with me.  Joy.  So I have to go back
to the showroom and swap out with the demo unit.  The demo unit is in good
condition, and as long as it works, I'm happy.  In, out, no problem, right?

Wrongo, my little pillar of consumerism.  Enough people bitched that I didn't
get the Dolby Digital 5.1 setup that I looked at "cheap" KEF Q15 speakers for
my front and rears....oh, what the hell, I bought a trio of them.  But I can't
have five speakers without a sub woofer, right?  Well, we'll keep the sub
cheap, like < $1000, right?  Sure...hey, and there's a wonderful M&K MX125 II
for only...$999!  Woo-hoo!

Then I need a nice rack for my stuff, and THAT wasn't free exactly either.  I
think I'm going to start building all my own furniture, along with my own
cables.  Irk.

I'm real dangerous when I actually have money.

So now the home system consists of:

- overpriced rack
- Denon AVR3200
- Sony S3000 DVD player
- Mitsubishi HSU770 SVHS VCR
- Toshiba TW40 16:9 RPTV
- Sony DSS receiver

Now that I've got the system where I want it, I have to cope with some of its<b
