Got so pissed about the Monster Cable monopoly that I've decided I'm going
to try and learn how to build my own cables.  So I went to Radio Shack and
bought a soldering iron, solder, multimeter, some cable, and some connectors
to play with.  After I get working pieces, I'm going to move up and grab some
"real" cable from Belden or some other similar source, and also some real
industrial quality connectors (isn't it about time the RCA connector just
died?).

While I was there I found some 12 ga speaker cable for $1.20/foot!  Woo-hoo!
Similar cable, sans connectors, from Monster would have been about $60.  I
just wish Radio Shack sold more high quality connectors -- the RCA connectors
they had were pretty cheap looking.

Oh, and everywhere I looked today didn't have spade lugs in stock.  Irk.

Does anyone know why digital, video, and audio RCA cables are different?  Is
there a standard net resource that gives you information on cables from
a technical perspective, e.g. strands, AWG, shielding, jackets, etc. and 
how they work together and for what applications?

Today, we discuss home theatre, or, more specifically, the one I
bought today. :-) 

Actually, this is a relatively modest system for the family room.  A 
normal family room has a horrible configuration when it comes to
proper acoustics, and mine is no different.  The back side is against a 
bunch of windows, the left side has a fireplace and a door to the master
bedroom, the right side is semi-open into the kitchen area, and the
front side has a set of double doors to one side of it.

Basic criteria for a family room home theatre -- be practical, don't
go into bankruptcy over it, and understand that it won't be perfect
because of room acoustics.  Given this, getting perfect speakers or
amps or whatever is a lost cause.

So, with this in mind....

The TV was the easiest part -- I knew for quite some time that I was
going to get a Toshiba TheatreWide 40" RPTV.  Great picture, it's
not gigantic, and best of all -- 16:9 letterbox!  Woo-hoo!  The set is
not cheap -- $2500 (although I got mine for $2200) for a 40" TV -- but
it is very nice.  And it has component video in (not that I use them,
but it's nice anyway).

Since this is meant to be practical, I opted for a receiver instead of
separates.  Basic requirements for the receiver were:

- reasonable array of AV inputs/outputs
- 85W/channel
- Dolby Digital decoding
- $1000-1500 price range

The contenders were the Yamaha 2090, Denon AVR3200, and Onkyo 838.  To be 
honest, in that price range most receivers are about the same.  I opted for
the Denon AVR3200 for no particular reason other than it was the most
convenient at the time.  Oh, the Marantz SR880 was another option, but it
is essentially a rebadged Harmon Kardon unit.  *shudder*  The Denon was
about $1000, which was at the lower end of the price range.

For the DVD player I went with the tried and true -- the lower end Sony
unit, the 3000.  It's simply the best in its price range ($600).  So why
not the 7000, the flagship in Sony's line?  For one, it would have been
overkill for the family room.  Second, I think it'll likely be replaced
sometime in the near future by a newer unit, so I would be buying an
obsolete unit.

My VCR is a Mitsubishi HSU770 SVHS unit I've had for about two years now.

My laserdisc player will hopefully be a used unit that George Broussard
might sell me (hint hint George :-) ).  The unit is a Pioneer CLD-704.

Since I want to watch regular TV, I bought a new Sony DSS mini-receiver
(my sat dish is already set with a dual LMB, and the extra coax has been
run) for $250.

For speakers I bought a pair of KEF UniQ 75s. They sound astounding, but
to be honest the Paradigm and B&W series I tried in a comparable price
range probably sounded as good, but suffered because they were in crappier
rooms.  I'm quite happy with their sound, and they have very good frequency
response; this is vital since I didn't want to require a subwoofer in this 
setup, since I'm aiming for "practical".  To be honest the 65s and 55s from 
KEF sounded really good, and only lost when compared directly against the
75s via an A/B switch.  I ended up paying about $1600 for the speaker
pair.

Notice that I don't have a center channel, rear speakers, or a subwoofer,
all of which are required for Dolby Digital 5.1.  I may end up getting
some surrounds, maybe even a sub, but right now the issue is placement.  I
really don't have anywhere that good dipolar or in-wall speakers could be
placed.  The center channel may end up getting tossed in there since it's
easy, and same with the sub (probably a $1000 sub of some type, e.g.
Paradigm, NHT, Sunfire, or Velodyne), but surround placement poses a 
bit of a problem.  And th
