Okay, surprise plan update before I start going into grind ahead mode
for my GDC speech.

We ran some benchmarks tonight testing out some of our newer optimizations
for Quake3, and decided to compare the top four accelerators that we
consider relevant: Voodoo2 (for obvious reasons), ATI Rage128, and
the NVidia RivaTNT and RivaTNT2.

We tested 640x480x16bpp very thoroughly, since this was the lowest common
denominator among the accelerators, however we also made a few tests
at 1600x1200x16bpp to test fill rate and 640x480x32bpp to test likely
operating conditions.  Tests were run on a best case machine, a P3/500.

640x480x16bpp (16-bit textures):

RivaTNT2		- 50.7
Rage128			- 48.1
RivaTNT			- 48.0
Voodoo2			- 44.7 (Ed: HOLY SHIT THAT'S GOOD!)

640x480x32bpp:

Rage128			- 47.0 (16-bit textures)
RivaTNT2		- 43.7 (32-bit textures)
RivaTNT			- untested
Voodoo2			- N/A

1600x1200x16bpp (16-bit textures):

RivaTNT2		- 18.1
Rage128			- 15.1
RivaTNT			- 11.7
Voodoo2			- N/A

Comments:

I'm really really really REALLY amazed and giddy at how fast the Voodoo2
performed.  John and I were absolutely dumbfounded at the performance we
saw, which was just phenomenal given that it's fairly old by accelerator
standards.  Major kudos to 3Dfx's OpenGL team for improving their driver
as much as they have recently.  I wish we had managed to test the Voodoo3
we have at 1600x1200, since it should have performed phenomenally well
because of its strong fill rate.  Unfortunately I "upgraded" the BIOS
on my V3 and it's not feeling very well right now.  But if extrapolation
proves correct, the V3 may actually prove to be the fastest board of
the lot even at 640x480, since it's 38% faster than the V2 on a PII/300
and thus could be that much faster on the PIII/500.  Once my board
is healthy again I'll put up the numbers.

You actually don't notice much of a visual difference between 1600x1200 and
640x480 believe it or not.  I think 640x480 is sort of the sweet spot
still, but I could see gamers bumping up to 1024x768 when this resolution
essentially becomes "free".

I plan on doing a very comprehensive set of benchmarks (hopefully with
Permedia3 and Savage4) after Q3TEST has been released.

Finally, props go out to the OpenGL guys at ATI and NVidia (especially
NVidia, which has shown a strong commitment to OpenGL for a very long
time and who are one of the pivotal figures in making OpenGL a viable
option for developers and players alike).  NVidia has always had a 
very fast (and just as important -- robust) OpenGL driver, and their 
hardware has always been top notch.  The Rage128 is giving TNT and TNT2 
a run for their money, but we won't have anythin
