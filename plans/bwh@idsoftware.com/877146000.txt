------------------

Recompiled Quake2 on the Enorex DEC Alpha system, and it worked pretty much on
the first shot.  The main problem we had was a divide-by-zero error that was
masked on WinNT/Intel but which manifested itself as an exception on WinNT/AXP.
The cool thing is that this may, in fact, be a real bug that would have been
very difficult to find if we hadn't ported to the Alpha.

The DEC Alpha version of Quake2 will be compiled specifically for the 21164,
and should run fine on the 21264.  It supports both software rendering and
OpenGL rendering.

For OpenGL rendering the only hardware accelerator we have to test with is the
Permedia 2, and I'm pretty damn pleased that 3DLabs is supporting the DEC Alpha
far more than just about any other OpenGL vendor out there.  This is a niche
market, but it's a high-performance niche market that clearly stakes out the
high end.

Right now the 3DLabs driver is missing some pretty important features that are
necessary to truly enjoy the full Quake2 experience.  There are some annoying
bugs which we can live with (not being able to toggle between fullscreen and
windowed modes), but the two major killers are lack of colored lighting (that
whole src*dst blending thing again) and no glTexSubImage2D support.

The colored lighting can be lived without -- people running in software won't
get colored lighting, so not having it in the GL version isn't crucial if
you're using a Permedia2.  However, glTexSubImage2D support is pretty vital
if you want dynamic lights.  Currently we disable dynamic lights if we know
we're running on a Permedia2, but this can be overridden by setting the
appropriate cvar ("/gl_dynamic 1F").

Software refresh support on the Permedia2 is pretty impressive.  Ref_soft runs
great in all kinds of video modes, including 320x240, 400x300, and 512x384.
Fullscreen mode is pretty much required if you want to get the most out of 
things, however -- the DIBSection performance we saw was pretty abysmal, most
likely the result of 8->16-bit translation during the BitBlt.

With fullscreen rendering, the Enorex w/ Permedia2 was pretty amazing,
especially using ref_soft -- and especially considering that NO AXP specific
asm code was being used.  If we or DEC were to slightly tweak the AXP rendering
paths, performance would likely go up a HUGE amount.

We plan on doing a full round of testing with Quake2 timedemos in the next day
or so.

Man, "Peace Sells But Who's Buying?" by Megadeth is one of the coolest albums
of all time.  Back in The Day there weren't many bands that were REALLY trying
to be "hard" -- you basically had Metallica and Megadeth.  It was really cool
when there were people really trying to do something new and interesting and
definitely hardcore compared to the crap (i.e. Ratt, Bon Jovi, Whitesnake,
and the other hair bands) that was circulating.

Saw that Ritual hired Gary McTaggart from 3Dfx.  It's going to be interesting
to see what they can do now that he's on board, since his acquisition will
give them all the tools necessary to do some really cool and different
stuff.  Gary is amazingly smart and creative, and Ritual has the potential to
become one of the premiere game companies in the industry.

From my own experience working at 3Dfx I can say that being a wannabe game
developer at a hardware company was one of the more frustrating experiences
in my life, so it's cool to see another 3Dfx alumnus get a job at a cool game
company.

Gators are probably going to get their asses kicked by Auburn -- they just
benched Johnson for disciplinary reasons.  Oh jeez...I'm going to be really
depressed this weekend I think.

Okay, Paul Steed mentioned something about "crunch time", and I'd thought I'd
add something about that.

Crunch time sucks.

Crunch time rules.

Crunch time sucks because you don't get sleep and you're really tense and 
stressed all the time.

Crunch time rules because everything comes into focus and you see all the
different pieces coming together into a product that is greater than the
sum of its parts.

We've really got a competent team here making some kick ass products, and 
I'm proud to be a part of it.

Okay, you folks can stop telling me why you don't play on Inferno anymore. :-)

The unscientific breakdown is something like this:

- most people suffered a pretty horrific hit with ping and/or packet loss after
we switched ISPs, so those folks are playing elsewhere

- because of our new ISP, connectivity seems pretty flaky, and Inferno often
doesn't even show up on master server lists

- because fewer people play on Inferno because of shitty ping, the levels that
are normally run (DEATH32C and BASE32) are too large for 4-6 players, meaning
even fewer people want to join.

- because no one is on, no one joins (self-fulfilling kind of thing)

!Football

I've noticed that Inferno is basically empty these days.  If you used to play
a lot on Inferno and quit playing there, drop me a line and let me know.  I'm
curious if there are particularl levels you dislike (DEATH32C, BASE32, etc.)
or if you've noticed a really bad drop in performance lately or if it's
something else.

!Quake

Once Kordell Stewart gets some real experience I think Pittsburgh is going to
have a phenomenal team.  Having to deal with a QB that can throw _and_ run is
going to be interesting for a lot of defensive coordinators.

The Gators lost to LSU...I'm still reeling from this.
