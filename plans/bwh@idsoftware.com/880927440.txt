John and I have started researching Java.  Overall, I really like the language,
although I haven't used it just yet.  I've read a couple books on Java ("Just
Java") and another book on the AWT, both of which have been really good (and
cover Java 1.1).  I'm using the Java 1.1.4 JDK from Sun for Win32.

There is an assertion made in one of the books that for all intents and
purposes Java has supplanted C++ as the premier OO programming language.  I'm
not quite sure I buy into this just yet, but I can see a HUGE class of apps
that are more conducive to Java than to C++.  C++'s deficiencies are well
documented, and for the longest time the only defense for these shortfalls was
"well, it's the best thing out there."  I think in many cases that C++ is NOT
the best thing -- hell, I prefer ANSI C, and I know C++ pretty damn well.

That said, we won't be writing Trinity in Java anytime soon, but we will look
into using Java for our tools.  The idea of writing a program once that runs
on our NT, Win95, and SGI Irix boxes makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.

Java has been pretty easy to learn, since its syntax is essentially the same
as C++, with some minor differences.  Some cool things they did was to specify
the exact size of types (e.g. ints are 32-bit, longs are 64-bit, etc.).
However, currently Java implementations are 32-bit in terms of memory
addressing -- all array indices are 32-bit ints, so you cannot have more than
4GB of addressable bytes.  If you do arrays of larger objects you could 
theoretically access more than 4GB of memory, but I have a feeling that will
just explode.

ANSI C, on the other hand, under both DEC Alpha and MIPS R10K, supports 64-bit
pointers.  And yes, there is a good chance that for our next generation set of
TOOLS that we will need 64-bit addressing.

After I get a little more familiar with the language, and maybe find the OpenGL
bindings for Java, I'll write a toy app to see how it works.

Oh yeah, I'm a level designer now!  WOO-HOO!  Since I'm going to be working
on the tools for Trinity John felt that I should know how the map editor
works, so I finally caved and started doing a deathmatch map.  It looks like
crap, and plays even worse, but that baby is mine, all mine. :-)

I did an interview for GameGirlz, check out http://www.gamegirlz.com.  It's
probably my favorite interview I've done, since I didn't have to talk techie
shit all the time, AND GameGirlz didn't screw it up completely.

Just wanted to mention that I had a good time recently hanging out with Vik
Long and Dennis "Thresh" Fong and Anna (of AFT fame).  It was really weird
that in the middle of id there were four Asians sitting around talking about
martial arts and stuff.  Really stereotypical.  If John Tam of Activision
(one of the studboy QA jimmies over there) had been around, hell, the rest
of id would've been scared.  God knows, we'd start spontaneously practicing
kung fu on everyone or making rice or something.  *shudder*

"Chinese people aren't very good at barbecuing, the rice keeps falling through
the grill."  God, that one STILL cracks me up (thanks to John Tam for telling
me that one).

The best part was when Vik, Thresh, and I went to Hooters and the waitress
finally came up to us and said "I gotta ask, where are you guys from?!" and
after determining that we were Chinese proceeded to tell us how fucked up
it was that some kid is anointed something special then taken away from his
parents to be raised by "Buddha monks or something".  Thank goodness she
cleared THAT up.

Anyway, it was cool hanging out with a bunch of American-Asians, if for no
othe reason than being able to say "Wow, there's a bunch of Asians at id
software, and I'm one of 'em".  The best part was deathmatching Vik and
Thresh and being able to hurl racial slurs at each other (we're allowed to
do that to each other, it's a minority thing, you wouldn't understand).

And I full on busted Thresh in the head with a rocket once, and actually
killed him -- you could hear his scream at Town East Mall practically.  I
think that was the only frag I got on him fair and square -- it's like the
game KNOWS he's playing.  I tried to bust a BFG cap in his ass, got it off
and everything, and bee-yatch ducked that shit and tagged.  Shit ain't even
funny how bad he schooled me/us (typical DM scores were something like, uh,
Thresh: 72, everyone else combined: 4).

And this was the first time he got to DM with Quake2, which is a RADICALLY
different DM experience than Quake or QuakeWorld, and on levels he had never
really seen.

West Coast Asians here to represent!

(Yes, this update is meant to be somewhat self-deprecating and funny, so
don't freak out).

BOOT Magazine is officially on my shit list.  The interview that they posted on
their Web site is just crap.  They edited it enough to screw up the context of
what we were saying or, in some cases, they managed to make us say something
that we weren't, but they didn't edit out the pieces we wanted removed to
avoid confusion.

See, part of the agreement John and I had with BOOT was that we would talk
freely about stuff over the course of several hours, with the full knowledge
that we had the right to remove the stuff that we were uncomfortable seeing
in print.  We also reserved the right to correct the article factually --
I've seen them butcher enough interviews (e.g. the one with Scott Sellers)
that I know they don't have the technical background to properly transcribe
an interview with technical people.  Christ, they put "de-buffering" instead
of "Z-buffering" through all of Scott's interview!

So after our interview they DID send us a copy of the PRINT version of the
article that we were to review, which we did (and we did make some edits),
but we were happy.  But they posted th
