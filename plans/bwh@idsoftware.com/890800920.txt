March 25, 1998
--------------------

Xian was kind enough to let me drive his new p1mp mobile, a Porsche Boxster,
since I've been deliberating about getting a sports car for some time now
(roughly about the same amount of time I've been at this company).  Problem
being, of course, that getting a new sports car typically involves learning
how to drive a stick shift.  Now, I DO know how to drive a stick shift, but
I just haven't driven one since borrowing my sister's Isuzu I-Mark ca. 1990,
so I didn't feel like I REALLY knew how to drive a stick.

So I managed to convince Xian to let me drive his shiny new, candy like 
babe attraction device, and I found out that driving a stick is like
riding a bike -- you never quite forget how to do it.  Didn't stall out
once, and only caused it to really lurch badly one time.

So that pushes me closer to sports car land again.  I'm hoping that my
rational side will prevail soon, but we'll see what happens.

Yesterday I was not in The Zone.  I couldn't concentrate for shit, too much
shit going on in my life or whatever.  Today, I was much more in The Zone,
and worked on writing a ZIP file reader.  The PAK file structure we have
right now is relatively ideal for what we use it for, but it has the huge
downside of not having widely available tools to manipulate it (like WinZip)
and it's proprietary.  Being able to open, manipulate, and muck with our
data files is a Good Thing.

So right now you can have ZIP files in your path, e.g. PAK2.ZIP, and they'll
be sucked in just like PAK files.  Rock on.  It's our intention that PAK
files will be gone in Quake 3, replaced completely with good old industry
standard ZIP files.  As Prince said, "Wouldn't that be cool?"

Another advantage of ZIP files is that they have optional compression (which
I currently don't support), which may help quite a bit when we're trying to
cram everything onto a single CD.  (Speaking of which, I really hope that 
our next game after Quake 3 will be a DVD-only instead of multi-CD...I think
multiple CD titles are just a Bad Idea, and to be a
