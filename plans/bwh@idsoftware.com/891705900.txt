Accelerating a Viper in 1st while turning is a Bad Idea.  No damage, but
that was my first real scare in that car.

Viper Rule #4: If you have to punch it to merge with traffic, just wait.

I'm a CTF freak, as anyone that plays on satan:27913 would know.  Some 
comments:

CTF STRATEGY

A CTF Strategy Guide should be required reading before you play.  I've seen
so many people just treat the game as a free-for-all w/ grapple instead of
an actual team game.  Common mistakes include:

- grabbing health and armor in front of your flag carrier
- not escorting your flag carrier
- not clearing enemies out of your base while your flag carrier is trying not
  to get killed
- leaving the base undefended
- getting engaged in pointless 1-v-1 battles -- killing the enemy doesn't
help that much unless you're denying them a tech item or unless you're clearing
out an area.
- if you're lagged, do NOT BECOME THE FLAG CARRIER!

CAMPING IS COOL

FOV 30 + railgun + sensitivity 1.0 = angel of death.  Do NOT get in a railgun
match with a 0-ping guy with resistance + armor. :-) Railgun + double damage
equals instant death.

Snipers work in pairs, a spotter/close-in person to defend the sniper while
the sniper is doing his/her thing.  The Stronghold is bad that way -- you can
get in the sniper zone while someone walks up behind you and puts a blaster to
your head.  You need sniper teams on that level.  But one sniper team can 
easily kill one person every 15 seconds and keep that area clear.

TECHS

The Autodoc is a little too powerful, should probably not refresh the armor I
think.

The Shield isn't powerful enough.

BFG SUCKS FOR CTF

That's just my opinion, but it really isn't fun when some no-talent just hops
in the water, grabs a BFG + cells, then clears out the base in three shots.

SPECTATORS ON SATAN SUCK

There is a HUGE line of people trying to get on Satan at any given time, so if
you're spectating you're preventing someone else from playing.  When I'm on I'm
pretty insistent that spectator play or leave.

PEOPLE THAT QUIT PLAYING BUT STAY CONNECTED SUCK

Even MORE annoying are people that play the game, then have to go to the
bathroom or get a drink or answer the phone and don't disconnect.  They take
up a valuable slot just sitting there, but since the line is so long to get
on Satan people don't want to disconnect because they might not get on 
again.  That sucks.

If I'm playing and someone is just standing on a spawn spot and doesn't respond
to a hail, I kick them.

Someone else asked "Why not the M3?"

Pros:

- pretty fast
- "sleeper" appeal
- not very expensive (relatively speaking)
- seats 4 comfortably

Cons:

- 15% of id employees already have a black M3
- Cash's M3 is having a supercharger installed
- not exotic enough

I probably knew I was getting a Viper a long time ago when Carmack said to
me many months ago:  "You should get a Viper, it suits your personality."
 
People have pointed out (with varying degrees of politeness) that if I truly
wanted to comment about upcomingn products based solely on a
