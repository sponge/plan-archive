Spent the last three days working on Q3DATA (the successor to QDATA), reving
it to support our newer model data.  We no longer compute ST coordinates
within Q3DATA, instead we're going to let the artists do ST computation 
via Alias' built in texture coordinate generation facilities.  We're also
no longer computing normals, since Alias automatically computes those so
the information is right there anyway.  We're also now loading things as
polysets instead of as single monolithic vertex pools.

I still have a ways to go to get this up to the level we want to support
the new features in our character rendering, however a stupid bug 
sidetracked me for almost two days. *irk*  Hopefully I can get some real
work done tomorrow.

I'm on a "normal" schedule, showing up between 9:30 and 10:30 and leaving
between 8 and 11.  My body likes this schedule much more.  I tend to fall
asleep very quickly at night instead of tossing and turning for a few
hours, and I wake up pretty easily after 8 hours of sleep.  The downside
is that now that I fall asleep quickly I don't have time to read or watch
TV anymore.

My Dodge Viper has some issues with fourth gear, so it's under warranty 
repair right now.  Irk.  The Volvo AWD XC wagon doesn't quite have the same
performance, but oh well, it gets me around.

NFL draft is coming up soon (this weekend I think).  Woo-hoo!

You know, I always thought Larry Niven's solo work pretty much sucked.  His
collaborations with Pournelle or Pournell and Barnes were much better.  Some
major classics are "Lucifer's Hammer", "Legacy of Heorot", and "Footfall".

Do you think it should be "Quake V", "Quake Five", "Quake 5.0", or "Quake 5"?
This is a pretty important decision, probably the most important decision
left for Quake V (working title).  The storyline and plot for Quake 5 was
originally going to be "run around and blow up lots of shit", but after
a pretty heated company meeting we decided (with quite a bit of dissent)
that it should be changed to "run around and blow up lots of shit *while
trying to avoid being killed*".  I dunno, that kind of blows the purity and
original intent of the series, but I'm willing to go with it, although I
sort of feel like we're seeling out by changing the story so much.

Noise functions are cool.  They are, however, complete and utter hacks.  There
is no real "science" to creating cool procedural textures or geometry, it's
primarily an art, but I'm learning it via a visualization tool I wrote, and
stuff is pretty cool.

The Viper GTS could REALLY FUCKING USE ABS.  Some idiot pulled out in front
of me on the service road in front of id -- I was only doing about 60, and
he and I were staring at each other for 5 seconds before he decided to make
the move into the far lane in his minivan -- and I had to slam on my brakes,
leaving some nice big flat spots on my tires (I assume) and some nice wide
black streaks on the service road.  Irk.

My two latest projects are working on noise functions ("Texturing and Modeling:
A Procedural Approach" by Ebert et. al. is a great intro on this) and working
on the character animation stuff.

For the noise stuff I've implemented a straight interpolated lattice noise
function that uses 4D inputs (x,y,z,t).  I'm writing a visualization 
program in MFC w/ OpenGL (I needed an excuse to learn MFC) that lets me
tweak noise parameters in real time.

Quadlinear interpolation is expensive as hell, by the way -- I'm looking
at 30 multiplies and 15 adds and 15 subs.  Ouch.  Will likely implement both
trilinear and quadlinear for final
