One thing I neglected to mention earlier was that I was really happy with
my scores because of other factors:

- I hadn't driven a stick shift in almost 10 years
- I picked up the car on Monday
- the drag strip was the first time I've EVER just revved a car and popped
the clutch

In other words, I'm not the most experienced driver in the world.

I've looked at mods for the Viper, but I'm holding off for at least another
year or so before pursuing that.

I wish people would quit ragging on Randy Moss' character "flaws", he's been
clean for almost two years, give the guy a chance -- we all make mistakes.

Oh, I guess I forgot to mention that I settled on a sports car -- I ended up
getting a 1997 Dodge Viper GTS (red, no stripes).  Had a great time at the
drag strip today.  The Viper is quite simply the best sports car you can get
for the money.  Other considerations were:

- Porsche 95+ 911 Turbo

Fast, fast, fast, and AWD.

Expensive, air-cooled, most people can't tell it apart from a 1984 Targa, and
we already have two 911s at id.

- Porsche Boxster

Looks great.

Way overpriced, not very fast, Christian has one already, difficult to come by.

- 1992 Lamborghini Diablo

Fast, fast, fast, and sometimes AWD (the VT).  VERY exotic.  Unknown 
reliability.

REAL expensive, no Lambo service centers in Texas.

- 1998 Corvette C5

Very fast, great car for the money.

Not exotic enough.

- 1995 Ferrari F355

Looks great.  It's a Ferrari.

Still looks, er, sorta like a Mustang or something.  Not all that fast.

- 1992 Ferrari Testarossa

Fairly exotic.

Very old, expensive parts, very expensive car, not that fast, has a Miami Vice
vibe going for it.

- Others

At no point did I consider a Mustang, Camaro, or other low-cost muscle car, not
even with supercharging yadda yadda yadda.  At no point did I consider a
tweaked out Japanese import either.

- The Viper 

The Viper is unique enough to make me happy, costs well under six figures, is
fast as beyond all belief, and is new (w/ warranty).

People have been sending me mail bitching and moaning about how Quake 3 won't
run on their systems because their system doesn't meet Q3's stated minimum
requirements.  This is an unfortunate by product of technological progress.  We
are not purposefully and maliciously excluding people with P5/133 processors
and PowerVR PCX2 accelerators, but we are faced with an age old dilemma - how
do we offer something better to the people with pimped out systems without
completely ruling out the large market with older systems?

The easy answer?  We don't.  Q3 will be released during a major transition
point for the entire PC industry -- the transition from crap 3D acceleration
to ubiquitous good 3D acceleration.  This is tough, because if we wanted to
expand our potential market greatly then we would have a software renderer, but
that's just not reasonable for the degree of technology we will be exploiting.
Most other engines coming out in similar time frames are also hardware only, 
and this is the cost of progress.

People bitched when VGA-only games came out, people bitched when Pentium only
games came out, and people will bitch when hardware only games come out.

People just like to bitch.

For some of the real cool effects that John has done we're looking at lots and
lots of passes.  That means we need hardware with 2-4x the fill rate of today's
hardware.  Yes, we will still run on a Voodoo, but no, it won't be "awesome" on
a Voodoo -- keep in mind that the Voodoo, as cool as it is, is a very very old
3D accelerat
