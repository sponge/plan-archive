I do not comprehend Microsoft's inability to write software that just works.

Here is the latest in my epic saga of "How to Write Software When Your Tools
are Written By Complete Idiots".  The sad part is that I know a lot of really
competent and smart people at Microsoft, yet I guess their code never makes
it into production software.  Or something like that.

So why am I griping?  Dig upon this scenario:

Given two identical machines (Intergraph Realizm workstations, identical
driver sets, both dual PPro/200s and 128MB of RAM, both running WinNT 4
with SP3), and given two IDENTICAL installations of MSVC 5 (w/ SP2), and
given that both grab an ENTIRE directory of source code (including all
relevant project and workspace files) from a central directory, and both 
do complete rebuilds without touching any compiler options, given ALL this,
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD THEY GENERATE DIFFERENT EXECUTABLES?  Different
sizes, and in many cases different behaviour.

If I build Quake2 on my machine using the "release build", the DLLs and EXEs
generated work just fine.  If either Cash or Carmack do the same thing, they
get fucked up, bizarre shit like weird spinning worlds and other randomly
bizarre stuff.

Did I mention this is with the same basic hardware on everyone's machine?  And
the same OS?  And the same compiler?  And the same project file?  And the same
workspace files?  Cash went so far as to format his hard drive and reinstall
everything from scratch, and he's getting the same problems.  Where are these
magic compiler options being stored -- in the Flash BIOS?!

Or maybe I have magic compiler options being stored in my registry...and in that
case, well, civilization is doomed and we may as well start building fires with
rocks again.

It's like the programmers at Microsoft have neither pride nor common sense.

All right, I'll shut up now, since if I say how I REALLY feel I'll probably
piss off even more people.

Quake related!  Woo-hoo!  Okay, nothing special, other than to say that we
talked to NVidia today and they showed us an early early early version of 
their ICD for Win95.  Very impressive, given the short amount of time they've
been working on it.

More football stuff, no Quake stuff:

This is what really gets my goat.  People are talking about all the best QBs 
out there in NCAA, and while Johnson scared me in the Southern Miss game, 
he's turning out to be a fucking complete bad ass. This boy WILL win the 
Heisman next year.  But who are they mentioning for Heisman and otherwise 
saying are the best QBs in the game?  Peyton Manning, Brock Huard, Ryan Leaf, 
even Chad Pennington.

Now, let's check their stats:

                             Att      Cmp    %    Yds     TDs
Tim Couch, Kentucky          202     132     65   1429    17
Chad Pennington, Marshall    160      94     59   1537    20 
Ryan Leaf, Washington St.    136      76     56   1327    13
Doug Johnson, Florida        127      71     56   1088    17
Peyton Manning, Tennessee    138      83     60   1004    10
Brock Huard, Washington       57      38     67    627     7

Here's the sick thing -- Thad Busby has a HIGHER POWER RATING than Peyton 
Manning.  Johnson's numbers are comparable to Ryan Leaf, yet Ryan Leaf is the 
one getting Heisman Attention.  Peyton has a slightly higher completion ratio 
than Johnson, but less yardage and slightly more than half the number of TDs.  
And Brock Huard hasn't thrown the ball but 57 times this year.

Chad Pennington is good, but he plays for Marshall in the MAC and has Randy 
Moss as his target.

Now, I'll ask this once again -- why is Peyton the shoe-in for the Heisman, 
OTHER than hype?  By the above reckoning Tim Couch should easily be 
considered the best QB out there (and last I heard he was the most widely 
recruited high school QB -- Spurrier wanted him pretty bad).  He's got the 
yards, attempts, TDs, and completion percentage to really stand out (what I 
don't get is that his power rating is actually pretty low, maybe for INTs?)

Yes, stats aren't everything, but when the front runner's stats are way 
behind many others AND his team isn't undefeated, you have to ask why Peyton 
is the Heisman candidate of choice.

Don't get me wrong, Peyton is a great QB and a great on-field general, and I 
respect the guy for staying an extra year (it REALLY irks me when people enter 
the draft as juniors, but if I were in their positions, I'd do the same, so I 
understand why they do it), so I guess this is more a rant about hype over 
substance.

Peyton Manning is ranked 27th out of Div 1-A QBs in terms of power rating.
