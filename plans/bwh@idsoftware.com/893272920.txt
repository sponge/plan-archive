Adam Hill pointed out this book to me:

"Wire, Cable, and Fiber Optics for Video and Audio Engineers (McGraw-Hill's
Video-Audio Engineering Series)" by Stephen H. Lampen.  Don't know if it's
good, but I just ordered it and hope to find out soon.

Read this, now, it's funny as all hell:

This plan file is about nothing.  Really.  I am going to talk about 
nothing right now, nothing at all.  Nothing interesting, nothing about
home theatre, nothing about cars, nothing about my sleep schedule, nothing
about other people, nothing about Quake 3.  Just nothing.  Void.  Null.
Nothing.  Emptiness.  Nope, nothing here either....wait, is that...no, 
that's nothing too.  This is...nothing.

Whoa, still talking about....nothing.  Wait!  I know, I'll talk about at
least two things...jack....and....shit.  Nope, decided against that too,
didn't want to talk about jack shit, so I'm gonna move on to...nada.  Yeah,
I'll talk about nada.  Nothing at all, nothing of any relevance, nothing
of any amusement.  Crapola, zippidy-do-da-fucking-blah, zippo, nil, 
sheer and utter nothingness.  The absence of anything.  Nothing.  Trent's
label, that's what I'm talking about.  Pre-big-bang.  Emptiness, the
complete and utter lack of something, anything.  Nothing.

This plan update is about nothing.  It's still about nothing.  There is
nothing between this word......and that one.  Just a bunch of ellipses,
so maybe that's something.  I doubt it.  Zilch.  The fashion victims
chew their charcoal teeth...that song.  Zero. !1.  f(x) = 0.  a-a.  All
products of any number and....zero.  Nothing.

This part is relevant....not.  Negatory.  Negative.  No sir, I don't 
like it.  And neither this part nor that part are going to be about anything
else.  There are no secret words in this message.  There is no phrase or
anything about Quake X.  QX.  AMSDDPF, ASQQ.  Do not ask what that meant,
for it means....NOTHING.

Right now I feel like talking about....abso-fucking-lutely nothing that
you care about.  Nothing.

If you've read this far, please NEVER EVER FUCKING E-MAIL ME THAT YOU DON'T
LIKE MY PLAN UPDATES, BECAUSE NO ONE MADE YOU READ AN ENTIRE UPDATE ABOUT
NOTHING!

Damn, I am up WAY too early.  I've had this bad tendency lately of getting up
at about 8AM, deciding it's too early, then falling back asleep for two hours,
which throws off my schedule (I'd optimally like to get up at about 9 so that
I'm at work by around 9:30 or 9:45).  So today I got up at eight and stayed
awake.  Now I'm debating if that was really a good idea.

I thought I had my compulsive spending habits under control, and for the
most part I do, but I really splurged again when I probably shouldn't have,
but what the hell, why do I work these hours if I'm not gonna spend the money
I make? :-) (Yes, the rationalizations come quick and easy for me).

So I'm giving Don, a.k.a. "Onethumb", a demo of my pimp KEF Q75 UniQ speakers,
and during the beginning of "The Fifth Element" my left speaker blows up.  Oh
wonderful.  British speakers...British cars...hmmm....

So I go back to the Home Theater Store on Preston, and they don't have a new
one in the warehouse they can exchange with me.  Joy.  So I have to go back
to the showroom and swap out with the demo unit.  The demo unit is in good
condition, and as long as it works, I'm happy.  In, out, no problem, right?

Wrongo, my little pillar of consumerism.  Enough people bitched that I didn't
get the Dolby Digital 5.1 setup that I looked at "cheap" KEF Q15 speakers for
my front and rears....oh, what the hell, I bought a trio of them.  But I can't
have five speakers without a sub woofer, right?  Well, we'll keep the sub
cheap, like < $1000, right?  Sure...hey, and there's a wonderful M&K MX125 II
for only...$999!  Woo-hoo!

Then I need a nice rack for my stuff, and THAT wasn't free exactly either.  I
think I'm going to start building all my own furniture, along with my own
cables.  Irk.

I'm real dangerous when I actually have money.

So now the home system consists of:

- overpriced rack
- Denon AVR3200
- Sony S3000 DVD player
- Mitsubishi HSU770 SVHS VCR
- Toshiba TW40 16:9 RPTV
- Sony DSS receiver

Now that I've got the system where I want it, I have to cope with some of its
idiosyncracies.  The TV is awesome, practically perfect.  The receiver is
nice, but it doesn't look like it has a crossover for the LFE channel (i.e.
sub output).  Irk!  I'd like to keep my crossover somewhere between 80 to
100Hz, but DD 5.1 states that the LFE channel is crossed over at 120Hz, which
is much higher than my system needs (my fronts are pretty full range and
go down to 36Hz).  Now, my sub has a cross over built in, but since there's
a hard crossover in the receiver at 120Hz, I'll have a notch in my audio
spectrum if I set the sub's crossover at anything less than 120Hz.  Irk.  The
receiver only has a volume adjustment for the LFE channel ("LFE trim"), and
a separate level adjustment for that channel also (why are there two separate
volume adjustments for the sub output?!).  Irk.

The M&K is a push-pull dual 12" sub, and one of the drivers is mounted 
underneath.  Unfortunately, I have real deep carpeting, and I think I'm
muffling things a bit.  I've raised the spikes as high as I can, but it's
still sitting pretty low.  I'm thinking of different ways of addressing this,
but right now the only thing that sounds satisfactory is building a custom
subwoofer "stand", i.e. a big, flat, heavy piece of something for it to sit on.

I'm also setting the M&K's level WAY down to about -8
