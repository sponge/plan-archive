Saw Brian Bruning's comments on Voodoo Extreme, and I'd like to clarify the
issue of 16-bit vs. 24-bit framebuffers with regards to id's technology.  It
is quite true that 16-bit dithered looks nearly as good as 24-bit graphics
_for most games_.  Even with GLQuake and Quake 2 the issue of 16-bit vs.
24-bit was largely irrelevant.  However, with Quake 3 we plan on rendering
with a LOT of passes, so the issue of framebuffer precision is amplified.

Also, he had a factual inaccuracy when he said that "*no game* has used 24-bit
rendering even though Rendition supports it."  Quake 2 will use whatever bit
depth a particular accelerator will support -- it runs in 24/32-bit mode
on Rendition V2x00 and 3DLabs Permedia 2 just fine.

Finally, his statement that "...Quake 3 will look and play incredibly on Voodoo
and Voodoo 2" was not entirely accurate.  We expect Quake 3 to be playable on
a Voodoo, however Voodoo will define the bare minimum performance and feature
set that will be acceptable for Quake 3.  A Voodoo 2 should be sufficient for 
Quake 3 with most rendering features enabled.  And a true 24/32-bit accelerator
will most likely look noticeably better than a comparable Voodoo or Voodoo 2.

The ZIP file issue has been resolved to my satisfaction (for now).  First off
I converted PAK0.PAK and PAK1.PAK to ZIP0.ZIP and ZIP1.ZIP by using an
unpacker that John wrote a while ago in Java.  After unpacking the PAK files
I rezipped them using InfoZip (sans compression) into ZIP0.ZIP and ZIP1.ZIP 
(yes, I could've put them into a single file, but what the hell, this was
faster).

Then I had to write the ZIP stuff.  I went ahead and made the assumption that
the beginning of the end-of-central-directory header was exactly 22 bytes from
the end of the file.  This means no ZIP file comments (oh darn), but simplifies
my life a hell of a lot.  After reading the EOCD header I take that info and
skip to the start of the central directory.  From there I read the directory
entries and store them in the pack_t format we have internally, so to the rest
of the code that uses the file system it could care less if we're using ZIP,
PAK, or files on disk.  Coolness.

The only gotcha is that the ZIP central directory entries store offsets to
the local file headers, not to the data themselves.  Obviously if I went
ahead and read the local file headers to get the proper offsets I may as
well just scan the entire ZIP and index it anyway, since reading all the
headers is sort of what I'm trying to avoid.

So instead I do a lazy evaluation of file positions whenever we try to open
a file within the ZIP file, i.e.:

if ( pack file is a ZIP file )
{
   seek to local header position for subfile;
   read local header;
   seek to uncompressed data start;
}
else
{
   seek directly to uncompressed data start;
}

So that's out of the way for now.

I was ambiguous about the DVD/multi-CD thing.  What I MEANT to say was that
Quake 3 is hopefully going to be a single CD, but any project AFTER Quake 3
will likely need more storage than a single CD can provide, which means that
the game-after-Q3 will either need multiple CDs or a DVD.  I hope it will be
DVD, but that may not be realistic depending on the time frame we're looking
at.

Thanks for all the pointers on the ZIP file info, however I can't get to the
central directory structure by zipping to the end of the file unless there
is no comment in the file.  Irk.  I'm still investigating.

Xian was kind enough to let me drive his new p1mp mobile, a Porsche Boxster,
since I've been deliberating about getting a sports car for some time now
(roughly about the same amount of time I've been at this company).  Problem
being, of course, that getting a new sports car typically involves learning
how to drive a stick shift.  Now, I DO know how to drive a stick shift, but
I just haven't driven one since borrowing my sister's Isuzu I-Mark ca. 1990,
so I didn't feel like I REALLY knew how to drive a stick.

So I managed to convince Xian to let me drive his shiny new, candy like 
babe attraction device, and I found out that driving a stick is like
riding a bike -- you never quite forget how to do it.  Didn't stall out
once, and only caused it to really lurch badly one time.

So that pushes me closer to sports car land again.  I'm hoping that my
rational side will prevail soon, but we'll see what happens.

Yesterday I was not in The Zone.  I couldn't concentrate for shit, too much
shit going on in my life or whatever.  Today, I was much more in The Zone,
