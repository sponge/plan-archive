December 14, 1997 (part 2)
------------------

For completeness I've run the benchmark at 800x600 on both the NVidia RIVA128
AGP and on the Rendition V2200 AGP and stuck them in the earlier table.  It's
pretty obvious from their numbers that the Rendition is pretty much fill
limited whereas the NVidia is host-limited.  This is good news for NVidia since
this means that tweaking their drivers will hopefully increase their numbers
across the board.

Just for grins I ran the Rendition V2200 at 1024x768....I'm impressed that it
works at all, but I don't think people are going to be playing at that
resolution with that performance anytime soon.

And for those of you that are curious, the ATI Rage Pro 8MB MCD got 10.8 fps
at 640x480 using their MCD on the Pentium II/200.  I'd have a hard time
recommending the ATI Rage Pro for Quake2 to anyone, unless you're going to be
running in software.  I suppose it would be adequate if you had one already,
were running NT 4.0, and were willing to run at a low resolution.  I'm not
sure what kind of performance gains they could realize with an ICD, but
overall, I'd have to recommend just about any of the other boards we've
tested over the Rage Pro.  HOWEVER, the Rage Pro does seem to have reasonable
features, so performance seems to be their primary killer more than anything
else.

I'd also like to take the time to thank the hardware vendors that have been
very helpful by providing frequent driver updates, supporting OpenGL
publically, and by providing as many loaner boards as possible.  These
companies include 3Dfx, NVidia, STB (specifically Chris Cox, who constantly
provides us with tons of testing boards -- dude, you're the Man!), Texas
Instruments (they provide us most of our Permedia2 boards), Rendition, and
NEC/PowerVR.

------------------

Okay, the questions have already started rolling in.  Some more data and
commentary for you:

- "SLI" means "scan-line interleaved", i.e. two Voodoo (or Voodoo2) chipsets
running in parallel, each of which is processing every other scan line.  You
can do this in a single board configuration (such as the Obsidian 100-4440)
or you can do this with two boards connected by some ribbon cable.  Currently
no consumer Voodoo boards support SLI out of the box, but supposedly Voodoo2
boards WILL support SLI out of the box.

- currently there is a throughput problem with the Voodoo2.  Well, it's not
really a "problem", it's more like a bottleneck at around 67fps, which is very
hard to classify as a "problem".  This means that having a Voodoo2 in an SLI
configuration doesn't make much sense unless you want to run fast high
resolution modes like 800x600.  Currently there is no significant difference
in performance between an SLI and non-SLI Voodoo2 configuration when runnning
at 640x480 or lower.  HOWEVER, if it turns out that they're artificially
limited in throughput (poor drivers, early silicon, low-speed parts, whatever)
then there is a chance that the SLI will make a difference -- although I have
no idea why you'd need to run > 60fps.

One possible explanation for the throughput problems is that Glide 2.x does not
support strips and fans, and we rely on those heavily.  If Glide 3.x supports
strips and fans (and their OpenGL supports this) then throughput could nearly
double since it will utilize the Voodoo2's on-board triangle setup engine very
effectively.

- the 2D card used with the PCX2 was an NVidia RIVA128 PCI.

- I have no idea what the pricing is going to be for Voodoo2, other than it is
targeted at consumers, meaning that it probably won't cost thousands of
dollars.

- I have no idea when Voodoo2 will ship, so this may all be moot if they can't
this thing out the door on time.

- the RIVA128 still has lots of room for improvement, and I'm sure that with
appropriate driver optimizations that they are going to get quite a bit
faster.

Every now and then a beast walks the landscape and devours all within its path,
knowing no natural enemy.  These are the things of legend: Michael Jordan,
Walter Payton, the great white shark, early Mike Tyson, and...

3DFX, ca. 1997

I've said this before and I'll say it again -- I left 3Dfx for a reason, and
it didn't have anything to do with wanting to branch out and expand my
horizons.  It had to do with the fact that I thought 3Dfx was confused and had
a severe lack of management and direction.  So when I say good things about
3Dfx, it's not because I love that company or anything -- sure, I have some
stock in 3Dfx, but the amount I have is a pittance (I negotiated poorly for
stock, and I left after only 1/4 of it vested), so I don't have a financial
reason to like 3Dfx.

If I say good things about 3Dfx, it's because their hardware rocks like no
other hardware company can dream of.  I empathize with their situation --
they make what is  arguably the single most important piece of consumer PC
hardware since the SoundBlaster, and all we keep hearing about are all the
"Voodoo Killers" that are gonna show up "any day now".  I cannot stress to
the world what kind of an amazing achievement the Voodoo was/is -- it easily
spanked it's nearest competitor by a factor of three, which is practically
unheard of.  Typically when looking at performance claims between hardware
it's impressive to see someone listed as "25% faster".  But THREE HUNDRED
PERCENT?!

That, my friends, is amazing.  And yet at times I STILL think people are
constantly looking at the horizon wondering what's going to be the "Voodoo
Killa", instead of appreciating the magnitude of what Scott Sellers, Gary
Tarolli, and Jim Margeson accomplished.

id had to hear the same noise after Quake when all the "Quake killers" were
gonna show up and even the landscape....sure, there were pretty screenshots
and big performance claims and projected release dates, but when it came down
to it, the first Quake killer to ship was...Quake 2.

It must be nice being a competitor of 3Dfx, since it's easy to aim for that
plume of dust they're leaving in their trail.

"So, what's the big deal?" you may ask.  Why the big 3Dfx Cheerleading all of
a sudden?

To answer that, let's just say "I ran the numbers".  But first, let us
establish some things:

1.  The test system, as I mentioned the other day, is a pretty big, macked
out, p1mped up system from hell.  It's an HP Pavilion 8190 Pentium 2/300 with
AGP, 6GB HDD, some kind of soundcard (disabled for testing), etc. etc.  A
pretty nice system.  Oh, and 96MB of RAM.

2.  Now, please do NOT send me mail whining that this system is not indicative
of what everyone has.  I KNOW this already.  But if I test on a Pentium/200MMX,
people are gonna complain that they don't know what kind of p1mped out new
system to get, or they'll complain that my test system should match our
minimum requirements.  If I test on a P5/133, people are gonna complain, once
again, that they don't know what kind of NEW system to get, or they'll complain
that I'm testing CPU performance, not hardware performance.

3.  Yes, certain accelerators are very dependent on CPU performance.  If I had
a P5/133, I would NOT get a PowerVR or a RIVA128 -- these two chipsets are
real dependent on CPU performance, more so than their competitors.

4.  A Pentium 2 was pretty much needed because I wanted to test AGP parts along
with PCI parts.  Also, some chips like the RIVA128 are going out standard on a
lot of Pentium 2 machines, so NVidia will have a (valid) argument that if I
test a RIVA on a P90 that this is NOT typical of a RIVA in the field.

So, I know I can't make everyone else happy, but I CAN make myself happy.  I'm
sure other people will run the benchmarks on lower end systems and print their
results, so all is not lost.

5.  These numbers, and chipset opinions, are GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE
OF GLQUAKE.  This may seem like common sense, but I KNOW some people are going
to whine that the numbers are lower than GLQUAKE's, so please...don't.  Also,
the performance dependencies of Quake2 are significantly different than that of
GLQuake -- we have lots more triangles going on, and I believe a lot more
textures.  This means that boards that work great with GLQuake (e.g. PowerVR
PCX2) aren't so hot with Quake2, and vice versa (Permedia2 is arguably a better
board for Quake2 than Quake because its triangle setup performance makes up for
its poor fill-rate).

Tests were run 640x480 and 512x384, fullscreen, at 16bpp resolution, with
sound disabled, using "sync to retrace" disabled if at all possible.  Tests
were run twice, and the best of the two scores was recorded.  I did not get
a chance to test the ATI Rage Pro because I don't have NT installed -- all
the more reason to see these guys support an ICD -- and I did not get a
chance to test the Rendition V2100 boards since they don't seem to work with
the V2200 software Rendition provided.  I used DEMOMAP DEMO1.DM2 to run
the test.  I also did not exec ANY configs, since this can throw off figures
if you inadvertently set "hand 2" or something.  All tests were performed
under Win95 OSR 2.1 with no other applications running.  Occasionally I would
run a test at higher resolution "just because".

As a "control" number I ran the test in software, fullscreen, using DirectDraw
on the Permedia2.

No overclocking of any type was done, and I did not run any "tweaks".  I'm
trying to represent the type of performance Joe User would get if he bought his
system at CompUSA, grabbed some add-in board (if necessary), then went home
and played.

General Comments
---------------------------------
Let there be no doubt, there is no new sheriff in town, the current one just
got a lot meaner.  Sure, the Voodoo2 4/4/4 SLI board isn't going to be that
common -- but if you can afford one, you'll have performance at 1024x768 at
almost DOUBLE the nearest 3Dfx competitor's performance at 512x384.

How ya like them apples?

Alright now, this is how this is gonna work.  First, all the news pages are
going to post links, and eventually this plan file will be forwarded to all
the appropriate people at all the various hardware companies.  All the people
that are going to end up looking bad are going to bitch at me because of
unfair comparisons, I didn't run on a slower machine, etc.  All the people
that are looking good are going to end up bitching at me because I didn't
make them look better.  Everyone is going to have nit picky gripes about
miscellaneous crap, including, I'm sure:

"we run faster in a window"
"we run faster fullscreen"
"we're scalable" (i.e. we need a faster CPU)
"they're CPU dependent" (i.e. they suck on slower CPUs)
"we support 24-bit"
"they don't support 24-bit"
"we have [insert feature here]"
"we have better image quality"
"you're using their beta drivers"
"you're not using our beta drivers"

---------------------------------
3Dfx Voodoo
---------------------------------
image quality:			good (identical to Voodoo)
performance:			very good
price/performance:		good
WinNT support:			yes
full OpenGL ICD:		no

notes:

I've said it before and I'll say it again -- look at the scores, and realize
just how long ago this chipset shipped.  I'm still in awe.

I didn't have a 4/2/2 so that I could run at 800x600.  When I get that I will
toss it into the mix.

The Canopus didn't show any significant performance increase, but this is
because I'm measuring OVERALL performance, and I'm NOT measuring transient
spikes in performance (i.e. stuttering).  We're looking into ways of measuring
framerate consistency in addition to measuring average framerate.  The Canopus
is still definitely a better board than the Monster3D -- that extra 2MB will
go a long way towards smoothing framerate, unfortunately that's simply not
going to be quantified up very well under a TIMEDEMO benchmark.

That Quantum3D had decent performance, but definitely not enough to justify
the price.  Note that it didn't see a huge performance boost at 512x384 vs.
640x480, indicating a throughput bottleneck of some type.

---------------------------------
3Dfx Voodoo2
---------------------------------
image quality:			good
performance:			insane
price/performance:		unknown
WinNT support:			yes
full OpenGL ICD:		no

notes:

OH MY GOD.

Fine, there were some visual glitches, but this is a pre-production board with
pre-production drivers, I imagine it's going to be a bit faster when it ships.
I just hope they don't pull a Rendition and take 10 months to ship.  Notice
that going to SLI doesn't really buy you that much except higher resolutions --
they have so much fill rate that they are limited by throughput almost
completely across the board.  On a the uber-Voodoo2 (4/4/4 SLI) there pretty
much isn't a difference in performance when running from 512x385 to 1024x768.

---------------------------------
3Dfx Voodoo Rush
---------------------------------
image quality:			good (identical to Voodoo)
performance:			okay
price/performance:		poor
WinNT support:			no
full OpenGL ICD:		no

notes:

Setting gl_swapinterval did not result in any visible tearing, so either it is
being ignored or they are triple buffering automatically (which would be cool).

---------------------------------
3DLabs Permedia2
---------------------------------
image quality:			poor (no MIP-mapping, no colored lighting)
performance:			okay
price/performance:		average
WinNT support:			yes
full OpenGL ICD:		yes

notes:

This board is perfectly adequate for games and level editing, although it
won't excel at either.  They're missing some texture formats, have pretty
icky image quality, and mediocre performance, however they do fully support
OpenGL and they also work with Windows NT.  Oh, and they also support a
full 8MB.

---------------------------------
Intergraph Realizm
---------------------------------
image quality:			excellent (32-bit ARGB, trilinear)
performance:			poor
price/performance:		very poor
WinNT support:			yes
full OpenGL ICD:		yes

notes:

This test was run on a Pentium Pro 200 instead of a Pentium II.  I'll rerun
the tests when I get access to American's machine which is a Pentium II.  As
you can see, the Realizm isn't the world's greatest performer, but it does
have very nice image quality and integrates flawlessly with GDI under WinNT.

image quality:			very poor (blocky, ugly, bad colored lighting)
performance:			good
price/performance:		good
WinNT support:			no
full OpenGL ICD:		no

notes:

Very CPU dependent performance, very bad image quality.  I'm amazed at what
their driver writer has managed to squeeze out of this thing.

---------------------------------
NVidia RIVA128
---------------------------------
image quality:			poor (some sparkling, weird looking textures)
performance:			good
price/performance:		good
WinNT support:			yes
full OpenGL ICD:		yes

notes:

Very CPU dependent performance, image quality would have been much better
if they had implemented per-pixel MIP mapping.  We got a good apples to apples
comparison of PCI vs. AGP with this board, and the performance difference
works out to about 18% faster for AGP.  I couldn't get 800x600 to work, but
when I do I will put that number in -- I'll probably run a lot of these
tests at 800x600 just to be complete.

---------------------------------
Rendition V2200
---------------------------------
image quality:			good (no per-pixel MIP mapping)
performance:			good
price/performance:		good
WinNT support:			yes
full OpenGL ICD:		yes

Dammit, Rendition, when are you gonna ship this puppy?!  I am emphatically
enthusiastic about this chipset, it's got great performance, and it's a fully
integrated part that does 3D-in-a-window really well.  It looks great, has
awesome image quality, a full feature set (except for per-pixel MIP mapping),
and in general just rocks.

These numbers are probably a little lower than they should be, since it looked
like syncing to vertical retrace was enabled and I don't know how to disable
sync on the V2200.

But it ain't shipped yet. *sigh*

Damn! Found a crappy bug with our GL_EXT_SWAPINTERVAL handling.  I have a chunk
of code that basically does this:

if ( gl_swapinterval->modified )
{
   UpdateSwapIntervalInTheDriver();
   gl_swapinterval->modified = false;
}

This works fine, until someone changes the video mode -- this causes the entire
OpenGL DLL to be unloaded, and when it's reloaded the swapinterval isn't set
appropriately, so if I ever did this:

]gl_swapinterval 0
]gl_mode 2

The value of "gl_swapinterval" would not be set after the mode switch.  Irk.

I'm extremely glad I found this bug though, otherwise all my numbers on 3Dfx
would have been suspect.  Whew.

Any IHVs that have NOT implemented the swapinterval extension -- I'm BEGGING
you to!  Please, it REALLY makes benchmarking a lot easier.

------------------

Didn't get much done today, spent most of today messing around with a brand
new HP Pavilion 8190 system.  Man, a few years ago computers like this simply
didn't exist -- fast, well built, well designed, easy to setup, and cheap.  It
comes with a big fat color poster showing how to put it together, and it has
EVERYTHING included -- Pentium II 300MHz, 32MB RAM, fax/modem, ATI Rage Pro w/
4MB of RAM (AGP), 6GB IDE HDD, the works.  And it cost $2700 w/o monitor.  Oh,
it also has a DVD-ROM 2x driver, and it includes a nice set of Polk Audio
speakers with a subwoofer.  Dig this -- the keyboard has CD-player controls
on it, and you can hook up the modem so that your computer does voice mail and
acts as a speakerphone.  Wow.

The only thing missing was a network card, which was easily rectified by
slapping an Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 PCI in there.  It took me over an
hour to figure out that it was the "B" model, not the "A" or "C" model, and
after that it was on the network.  The system only has Win95 OSR 2.1 installed,
and I'm not going to risk angering the Gods of Computer Moodiness by installing
Windows NT on it -- so no MCD scores (the only losses here will be Intel i740
scores -- which we're not allowed to print anyway, and ATI Rage Pro MCD scores)
but this isn't that big a deal, since MCD is officially dead-ola.

So I stick in the Rendition V2200, and it finally came up and worked like a
charm, and damn does it look GOOD.  Fast, good quality output, no glitches,
no problems.  People are gonna dig it.  The PCX2, unfortunately, installed
okay, but PVRGL.DLL wasn't loading. *sigh*

Tests are going to be 640x480x16bpp, fullscreen only.  Benchmarking takes up
WAY too much time, and as much as I'd like to get scores for P5/133, P5/200MMX,
PPro/200, and P2/300, I only have time to do one system, and that's gonna
be the high end.

Here's the justification: I realize that the vast majority of users out there
have lower end systems, but right now I'm trying to figure out which GRAPHICS
ACCELERATOR is the best, not which SYSTEM is the best.  We all know that some
accelerators are simply going to fall apart on low end systems -- the RIVA128
and PCX2 both come to mind, since they are both heavily CPU limited.  But the
fact is I want to determine what is the BEST Quake2 accelerator out there, and
that means removing the CPU as a measuring parameter.

So tomorrow I'm going to try and finish out all the scores and write something
up.  Tonight I got V2200 and RIVA128 numbers, tomorrow I hope to do...well,
everything else.

Cyrix sent word to us that we were apparently NOT keeping the system in
24-bit precision all the time (they also pointed out a bug where I was
setting the FP control word to 807f instead of 087f...whoops).  So anyway
I investigate this somewhat, and find that for some reason every time we
call LoadLibrary that the FP control word gets reset to 027f!  What's up
with that?  I'm not ruling out a bug on my end, but there's nothing
obviously screwed up on our end, so maybe this is some known behaviour of
LoadLibrary?

Will investigate more.

I will probably write up my lecture at UF and post it, so if you live in
Burkina Faso (or Alabama, same thing :-) ) you don't have to drive all
the way to see what mindless crap I ended up sputtering.

A reminder: it will likely NOT be a technical discussion, it's going to
cover mostly stuff about having a career in the computer industry.  At
the end there will be a QA session where we can talk tech if you want, but
the actual "Brian Standing In Front of a Crowd and Rambling" portion is NOT
going to discuss coding, optimization, graphics, or anything like that (other
than the parts that pertain to being successful).

Think of it as a Tony Robbin's speech given by some half-Asian dude who works
at id software.

Today's Soundgarden lyrics:

"Down in the hole,
 Jesus tries to crack a smile,
 beneath another shovel load"

Anecdotal Rambling: The VAX

Let me tell you about a pseudo-online subculture that existed before the
Web was invented.  It was called "The VAX", and it resided in CSE 211 at the
University of Florida.  It was a big ol' mainframe running DEC's multi-user
operating system, VMS (5.4 if I recall), and you logged into it through one
of a bunch of VT-220 terminals sitting in a HUGE computer room.  This was
back when computers were networked using ArcNet, and the other half of the
lab consisted of IBM PC XT machines with dual 5.25" floppy drives.

There was actually more than one VAX -- there were MAPLE, PINE, ELM, and
CEDAR.  But you only logged onto anything but MAPLE in the direst of
emergencies since the other systems were so damn slow.  Any student with
a valid ID could get a user account and 300 blocks of disk space (I think
a block was 512 bytes, but I don't remember now).

I messed around with the VAX quite a bit, learning some C programming, and
I also learned a bit of DCL, a REXX-like scripting language.  But the
interesting thing about the VAX was that it had a complete subculture of
people with nicknames, process names, message boards, and utilities like
ICQ ("send") and IRC ("phone").  These people were, invariably, freaks, and
I was one of them.  The people that inhabited this system included SORROW,
LIONESS, WINTERMUTE, SCRIB, CENOBITE, TIPMO, ENTERPRISE, JIAN, PETRA, RABBIT,
INFINITY, TRUFFLE, and a host of others.  You could log in and run a command
to see who was logged in and on what terminal ("J-11" would be someone on the
11th terminal on Row J) and, if you were hard up, you could see if that person
was a chick and if they were hot, and if so, you could start anonymously
sending them messages to get to know them.  You could set your self into
"nobroadcast" mode, meaning that people would not be able to send you a
message, and you could also set your process name to some message that
established how cool and deep you were.

Pathetic, I know, but that's computer culture for you.

Unfortunately, there just wasn't a whole lot to do on the VAX.  You could talk
with others, but most of the time these were people that were sitting two rows
away from you, so what was the point?  I used the VAX to learn programming and
also because it was located centrally to all the classes that I was busy
not attending. :-) It was also nice to send e-mail from the VAX -- this was
back in 1990 when e-mail hadn't really become the ubiquitous thing it is today,
so most of the time you ended up sending e-mail to people two seats away, but
hey, it was pretty cool anyway.

It was from a VAX account that I sent my very first e-mail to Michael Abrash
as an id groupie.  Heh heh.

Other VAXers would use it for its telnet capabilities to get into MUDs and
MOOs; some would use it to telnet to the big IBM mainframe (NERDC) on campus
or to the Unix workstations upstairs; yet others used it for FTP and GOPHER.

The other interesting thing is that most of the VAXers were NOT hardcore
computer freaks -- they were mostly people using it for social reasons, not
because they were programmers.  The REAL hackers were hanging out on the third
floor using Sun 3/60 and Sun 3/80 machines and, if you were REAL cool, a
Sun SparcStation ("lightning" was the first one UF received, if I remember
correctly).  See, REAL computer users used SunOS (and thought Solaris was the
spawn of Satan).  The VAX was for rejects that didn't have the clout to get
a Unix account...heh.

I'll tell you, I really miss the good old days, back in college when you had
few responsibilities but to pass the occasional class and mostly hang out
with friends.  I used to hang out with my friends Oz and Taco until 6AM
watching movies we'd seen a million times before.  We'd drink, party, talk
about each other behind each other's backs, fall in love with each other's
girlfriends, do stupid shit like that, and That Was Cool, because it was
a part of growing up.  When your only responsibility was to survive until the
next day and, hopefully, not get thrown out of school.  This was the brackish
time between being a kid and being an adult -- being old enough to really
really screw up, but young enough to recover.  Old enough to live away from
the parents, but young enough that you didn't have big car payments or
mortgage payments and it was really a trauma if your folks didn't pay for
your car insurance.  Back when you were trying to create your own identity,
but had the safety of your bedroom back "home" in case you created something
that sucked.  Back when you were busy proving to each other that you really
were independent, not just living away from home.

Then one day you grow up, and "home" ISN'T where your parents are, and your
old bedroom is now your Mom's den that has their new computer.  You find
out that you have mortgage and car payments, and you actually make Big Life
Decisions without even thinking about asking your parents approval.  You move
across the continent without telling anyone or asking permission, and you
suddenly have responsibilities.  You now have a job where if you screw up
and don't finish your work you actually GET IN TROUBLE, as opposed to just
failing and signing up for a new one by filling out the appropriate bubble
sheet.

Then one day it's no longer a big deal when you can buy booze, because everyone
can tell you're over 21, then the next day you realize you're closer to 30 than
you are to 20, and that punks in the mall don't even see you because you're
An Adult now instead of One of Them.  People call you sir, and when you're smart
and successful it's expected instead of "Oh wow, you are gonna go far someday",
because you're now old enough where if you haven't made it, you may never make
it.  You soon reach the point where you're no longer full of potential --
you're either a loser or you're not.

Growing up sounds fun when you're younger, but I'd give it all up to be back
in school, broke and not giving a shit, staring at the universe around me in
amazement and awe.

Christ, alright, didn't mean to get all morose there....
