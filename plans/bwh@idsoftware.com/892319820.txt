Noise functions are cool.  They are, however, complete and utter hacks.  There
is no real "science" to creating cool procedural textures or geometry, it's
primarily an art, but I'm learning it via a visualization tool I wrote, and
stuff is pretty cool.

The Viper GTS could REALLY FUCKING USE ABS.  Some idiot pulled out in front
of me on the service road in front of id -- I was only doing about 60, and
he and I were staring at each other for 5 seconds before he decided to make
the move into the far lane in his minivan -- and I had to slam on my brakes,
leaving some nice big flat spots on my tires (I assume) and some nice wide
black streaks on the service road.  Irk.

My two latest projects are working on noise functions ("Texturing and Modeling:
A Procedural Approach" by Ebert et. al. is a great intro on this) and working
on the character animation stuff.

For the noise stuff I've implemented a straight interpolated lattice noise
function that uses 4D inputs (x,y,z,t).  I'm writing a visualization 
program in MFC w/ OpenGL (I needed an excuse to learn MFC) that lets me
tweak noise parameters in real time.

Quadlinear interpolation is expensive as hell, by the way -- I'm looking
at 30 multiplies and 15 adds and 15 subs.  Ouch.  Will likely implement both
trilinear and quadlinear for final stuff, but until we figure out exactly
all the things we're going to use noise functions for I'm going to hold
off.

George, before you turn up your turbo boost, look into some stiffer springs
for the back of your car! :-)

The fun never stops.  Finished the P3D-to-SHADER converter, joy.  Some people
have asked what are the downsides to the Viper, given my apparent undying love
for the vehicle.  Heh heh.  Well, the Viper has many things working against
it:

- it's a Dodge.  Who the hell pays $70K for a Dodge?  (That's rhetorical)

- it's an American car.  Yeah, I guess I'm patriotic, but American cars simply
aren't built nearly as well as just about any other type of nice import -- cars
from Acura, Ferrari, BMW, Porsche, etc. have excellent quality construction and
never feel cheap.  The Viper feels pretty damn cheap.  It's the automotive
equivalent of the A10 Warthog -- wrap whatever you can around the engine/gun.

- the Viper brakes SUCK.  They fade pretty quickly (5 or 6 dragstrip runs and
my brakes were pretty toasted) and they don't have ABS.  This can be fixed with
an upgraded to 14" Hennessey rotors.  Just about any car out there should have
better braking than a Viper.

- no traction control.  That would help a lot with this car.

- no cupholders -- sorry, I miss going to Starbucks or somewhere else and 
driving home with a drink parked somewhere in my car.  Then again, few high
end sports cars have cup holders.

- no power seats with memory (not a big loss)

The newer Vipers (GTS and post-97 RT/10) actually have quite a few nice things
that people think are missing (mostly because earlier RT/10s WERE missing
these things):

- power glass windows
- AC and heater
- Alpine CD player w/ 200W x 6 channel audio
- keyless entry
- dual airbags

It also handles really well.  People assume it's a straight line car, but in
the latest Motor Trend Performance Car Shootout it had the best skidpad
numbers and the best slalom numbers.  And it was second in the road course
behind the F355, and it would have won if it had had its proper tires.

Some more things to consider:

- old muscle car

The '71 Cuda used to be my dream car, but the reality of owning a nice muscle
car is not nearly as pleasant as the dream.  Lead additives, finding parts, 
lack of basic creature comforts, etc.  Just not practical.  Oh, and they can't
corner for shit.

- sportbike

Something about the idea of having a seatbelt and airbags appeals to me.  And
while the Viper isn't quite as suitable for groceries as my Volvo V70 AWD XC
wagon, I CAN put like five bags of groceries in there.  I kid you not.

Christ, had no idea there were so many damn cars!  Okay:

- Cobra 427 Replicar

Fast, exotic, but not very practical.  No warranty service (in general).  Plus
it's a kit car (and I can't afford a real one, and no one believes people when
they say have a real one anyway :-) )

- Nissan Skyline

Cool car, ugly and not exotic looking.  Not available in the US.

- highly modified Miata/NSX/Mustang/Civic/Prelude/DSM/RX-7/Camaro

Uh, no.  You can modify just about anything and get lots of horsepower, but
first off, I'm not interested in JUST power -- if I were, I'd get a Talon and
p1mp it out.  Second, I like lots of top speed, and most super pimped out
inexpensive vehicles lack top end.  Third, super pimped out cars tend to have
parts of their drivetrain fall apart because they're not designed to be 
super/turbo/nitroused to death.  So you end up building a whole car from
scratch.  Finally, a fast Honda Prelude is still a Honda Prelude -- and I'm
not going to spend $40K on a Honda Prelude, even if it is real damn fast 
(although I'd like to see you try and turn the steering wheel with full
power on one of these FWD jobbies).

So now I'm writing a FD P3D ->
