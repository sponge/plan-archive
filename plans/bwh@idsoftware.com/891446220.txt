Someone asked me about the RIVA 128 and 128ZX and the RIVA TNT and how well
they would work with Quake 3.  Since Quake 3 doesn't exist yet we can't give
a definitive answer, however I can say that we are aware of the RIVA 128's
upside (high performance, lots of sales) and downside (various technical 
deficiencies).  John mentioned in an earlier plan update that the RIVA will 
definitely be a target accelerator, although it will clearly not be a
top tier accelerator for Quake 3.  RIVA 128's are fast and extremely popular
because of their price/performance, and so we're definitely going to have to
take that market seriously.  Unfortunately, it will be pretty onerous dealing
with some of that hardware's, er, idiosyncracies.

The Nvidia TNT, on the other hand, could quite possibly be the nearly 
perfect Quake 3 accelerator, ASSUMING that it lives up to its billed
performance, doesn't miss any vital features, and ships on time with a good
OpenGL driver. If all that works out, the TNT would be the one to beat, but 
since we've only seen paper specs and hype so far, I'm understandably reluctant
to bill it as the ultimate Quake 3 accelerator.

So in short: the RIVA128 will run Quake 3, but probably with lower performance
and diminished image quality than most people will desire.  The TNT _should_
be a great Quake 3 accelerator, but until it's shipping with drivers we won't
know for sure.  There have been many theoretically great accelerators that 
looked awesome on paper but failed to deliver in practice, so I'm quite a bit
leery of recommending or even being enthusiastic about something that I haven't
personally flogged.
