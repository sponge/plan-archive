People have been sending me mail bitching and moaning about how Quake 3 won't
run on their systems because their system doesn't meet Q3's stated minimum
requirements.  This is an unfortunate by product of technological progress.  We
are not purposefully and maliciously excluding people with P5/133 processors
and PowerVR PCX2 accelerators, but we are faced with an age old dilemma - how
do we offer something better to the people with pimped out systems without
completely ruling out the large market with older systems?

The easy answer?  We don't.  Q3 will be released during a major transition
point for the entire PC industry -- the transition from crap 3D acceleration
to ubiquitous good 3D acceleration.  This is tough, because if we wanted to
expand our potential market greatly then we would have a software renderer, but
that's just not reasonable for the degree of technology we will be exploiting.
Most other engines coming out in similar time frames are also hardware only, 
and this is the cost of progress.

People bitched when VGA-only games came out, people bitched when Pentium only
games came out, and people will bitch when hardware only games come out.

People just like to bitch.

For some of the real cool effects that John has done we're looking at lots and
lots of passes.  That means we need hardware with 2-4x the fill rate of today's
hardware.  Yes, we will still run on a Voodoo, but no, it won't be "awesome" on
a Voodoo -- keep in m
