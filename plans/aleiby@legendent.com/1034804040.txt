The sniper apparently just shot someone in Manassas... I was at Borders in that town, getting a cup of coffee... as I was leaving, traffic was backed up all over the place, but I slithered through and stopped at that nasty little gas station right outside the Borders/Hoyt's parking lot... as I was standing there opening the lid on my gas tank, the lady came out and said "We're closed, there's been a shooting up the road!" ... I fled cursing the Sniper under my breath. That motherfucker killed someone at the little Exxon 1/4 mile up the road from the gas station I was at, 5 minutes before that... the guy who got shot was pumping gas into his car...

That gas station is like right across the road from where Grant lives.  Great fun!  There's white vans with ladders everywhere you look.  We saw 8 of them on the way back from lunch.
