Equation of the day:

Gaussian(X,Y) = Amplitude * e^( -(X-Xo)^2 / Rx^2 ) * e^( -(Y-Yo)^2 / Ry^2 )



Also, in case I haven't mentioned it already, the guys behind Warcraft III's music rock!

And who was that blond Dead or Alive 2 model at the Temco booth at E3?


I talked with a German reporter-lady in the line for the XBox demo.  She was really cool, but now I'm realizing that I don't have a clue who she was.  (Of course my experience with the Aryan race -- can I say that?  It's one thing to kid around in the office, but quite another to bleed that on into a public forum... not that anyone reads this thing anyway -- as I was saying, Matt is really the only native German that I personally know.  Although I've been told that Leiby is a German name, not that that means anything anymore.  I don't even have blonde hair.)  So what I was trying to say is that anyone is cool, when all you have to compare them against is Matt... just kidding Matt.  :)  She was cool though, and she spoke better English than I do -- that always amazes me.  I only wish I knew German, now.  I've had more opportunities where I've wished I knew German that I've ever had knowing Spanish.  I sometimes wish I had attended a larger highschool where I actually got to chose what second language I learned.  Hmm... I guess there's no reason I can't start learning now.  I pick up new programming languages all the time (ok, once and a while).  And I've even got someone in-house to practice on now.  Note to self: Learn German, impress friends.  (Ok, two out of three ain't bad... er, one out of two?)


Well, somehow I managed to get on the topic of E3, so I may as well keep rolling.  Halo was cool.  Everybody knows that, I won't belabor the point.  I wish I had seen Metal Gear Solid 2.  I'm not sure how I missed it, but everyone I've talked usually ended up convulsing on the floor in a pool of saliva recalling the euphoria of the experience.  (That means it was good.)

/me suddenly remembers he has an [Enter] key and starts using it because he knows that no one reads paragraphs with more than one sentence these days.

I've always been a fan of Blizzard, so I spent copious amounts of time bathing in the aural soundscape of their Teletron presentation -- this is where I renewed my love for their musicians (Warcraft 2 is still my most favorite game soundtrack, and it was cool to hear them weave snippets of old melodies into the new).  I love Samwise's (I don't know his real name) concept art as well.  Of course Anthony (a new addition to our art team) equally kicks serious bootie in the concept art arena as well.  I cannot begin to explain how awesome it is to work with such talent.

Cool E3 freebie #1: Blinky bouncy-ball from Gamespot.

Cool E3 freebie #2: Miniature Evercrack figurines.

My life will be over when Final Fantasy XI comes out.  I've been holding off on the MMRPG scene until something that really catches my attention comes along.  FF:XI has done this.  I think the graphics are what have been holding me back up to this point.  Hopefully FF:XI will get massively delayed so I can at least live out a portion of my real life before becoming a digital slave to Squaresoft.

Let's see... what else was cool?  Epic's latest round of goodies is looking really sweet -- terrain, skeletal, alpha-blending, etc.  The future is rosy.

Wolf3D actually looked real cool.  My expectations weren't very high, but when I saw it, I was impressed.  I'll probably pick it up for remembrance sake if nothing else.  The only thing that disturbed me was the "use" button.  A leg pops out of no where to kick open doors and stuff.  It's a semi-cool idea, but the leg just didn't look right.

On Wednesday before E3 (we arrived in LA a day early) a bunch of us headed off to Universal Studios.  After eating, we called up our man Jim Warren and he got us some VIP passes and took us on a tour of the park.  It was great!  We got to skip all the lines and everything.  Thanks again Jim.  You da man!  

If you've seen the Terminator2:3D thing there, then you know about the mini-hunters.  They had a couple models hanging up in the gift shop, but they weren't for sale.  "I've got to get me one of those", said I.  If anyone knows where I can get one of those, let me know.

Back to E3.  I really haven't seen too many PSX2 games yet that have caught my eye.  With the Dreamcast, there was Soul Calibur -- enough reason alone to buy the console (in fact the only other game I've bought for it is Crazy Taxi).  But there's still a ton of games in the works for the PSX2 that I haven't seen, so we'll see.  Kessen had some really great graphics, but I'm not sure if I could get into the gameplay.  I guess FF:XI is for PSX2, but that'll be a while before that's out.

Oh, and I'm done with school.  Woohoo!  Time to grab my BS and head back to Virginia.  I wouldn't recommend to anyone to try working 40+ hours and attending school full time.  Tis anything but fun.  Sleep?  Sleep is for wusses.  :)

Ok, enough ranting.  I know I saw a lot more cool stuff at E3, but my brain is starting to shut down, so I'd better quit now.  And besides, if I say everything now, I won't have any content for my next bi-yearly update.


* Oh, and about the Aryan stuff.  I almost removed the comment, because I know some poor schmuck will get offended.  But seriously, if you have a problem with me joking around, then you really need to grow up (Damn, that sounds like a grown-up or something).  Sorry.
