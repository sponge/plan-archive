"Never exhibit your things half done, for they can be enjoyed only when complete. All beginnings are without form, and the image of this shapelessness tarries in the imagination; the memory of the thing seen imperfect lingers into the completed, forbidding the enjoyment of the magnificent in one gaze; even though this blurs the judgement of details, only through it is desire satisfied; before an object is everything, it is nothing, and in beginning to be, it is still very close to being nothing. Let every great master see to it that his art be seen not in embryo; bring it forth only when it is ready to be seen."

"Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive at; as railroads lead to Boston or New York. We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate... As if the main object were to talk fast and not to talk sensibly... After all, the man whose horse trots a mile in a minute does not carry the most important messages."
   -- Henry David Thoreau (Walden, 1854)
