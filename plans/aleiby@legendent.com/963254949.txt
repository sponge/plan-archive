I finally got around to reading "Snow Crash" and "Diamond Age".  What can I say? -- Neal Stephenson rocks!  I love his perspective on life.

One of my more favorite statements from the books:

"The difference between ignorant and educated people is that the latter know more facts.  The difference between stupid and intelligent people is that intelligent people can handle subtlety.  They are not baffled by ambiguous or even contradictory situations -- in fact, they expect them and are apt to become suspicious when things seem overly straightforward."
