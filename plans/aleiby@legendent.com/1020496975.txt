I listened through the director's commentary of Donnie Darko last night.  What a great movie!  It's wonderful to see a director with the balls to use a bit of subtlety.  A bit heavyhanded at times (heavyhanded subtlety?), but a great movie nonetheless.  We need to support more directors like Richard Kelly before Hollywood sucks their lifeblood from them.
