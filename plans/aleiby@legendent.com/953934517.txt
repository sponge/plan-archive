===================

Played a little WOT this evening, and the server I jumpped on was running a user made map called <a href="http://www.shadarlogoth.com/download/mplevels/Kinslayer/index.shtml">Kinslayer's Spire</a>.  Very cool.  I had a lot of fun.  My only complaints would be a couple issues of texture alignment, and not enough health pickups in the level.  But other than that, it was superbly done, and just plain fun.  That might mostly be due to my fetish for large maps -- everytime I turned another corner I was finding something new and cool -- I felt like I was running around a haunted house (a really cool one).  Keep it up.
