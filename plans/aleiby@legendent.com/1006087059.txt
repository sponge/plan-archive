Halo is all you wanted and more.  Congrats Bungie, on a job well done.

Scott and I just finished playing through the single player game in coop mode with normal difficulty.  It was tons of fun.  Very hard in parts, but extremely satisfying.  I don't have any idea how either of us would have gotten through it alone.  It probably just would have taken much much longer.
