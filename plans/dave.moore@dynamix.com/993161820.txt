  Last .plan update:

  Well, after 4+ years with the Tribes team (6+ depending
how you count it), and 21+ years in Eugene, Amy and I have
decided it's time for a change of scenery.
  On Friday, I'll be leaving Dynamix to take a position with
Oddworld Inhabitants in San Luis Obispo.  I've had an
amazing time working at Dynamix, and I'd like to publically
say thanks to all the people I've been lucky enough to have
the chance to work with here.

  To all the Tribes nuts out there:
"So long, and thanks for all the beer!"
