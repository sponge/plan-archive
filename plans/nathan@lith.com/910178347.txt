After hours of exhausting research, I think I've finally been able to translate Ben Coleman's mysterious message:

Original:

"Please ... No
& get of my fireballs man."

Translation:

"Please ... No 
& get some ice for my burning clusters dude."


 Hmm M-^â€¦ on second thought, maybe the original message goes way beyond any logical translation.   



5/7/98

Hmm ... where to start ... well, Riot's pumpin away.  We're getting close to our first beta and I must say that the game is looking sick* (a Todd C. word used to indicate sweetness).  Blood 2, as usual, is looking sick as well.  Sick in this case indicates:

1) a (1)affected with disease or ill health (2) quesey or nauseated, c: undergoing menstruation (IF YOU'RE A MALE AN BEGIN EXPERIENCING MENSTRATION, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR LOCAL PSYCHOLOGIST IMMEDIATELY)

2) Spiritually or morally unsound or corrupt (YUP!!)

3) sickened by strong emotion   b : having a strong distaste from surfeit (WHAT THE HECK DOES SURFEIT MEAN? ... ANYBODY??,) 

4) a: mentally or emotionally unsound or disordered (WE CALL THIS CRAIG HUBBARD SYNDROME) : morbid, macabre, or sadistic.

All the above apply's to Blood2 ... which means it's gonna be one of the sickest* game of the year (sick*, as in sweet).

* "sick" should be replaced by "sic" where noted.  I believe that would be the "hip" way to spell it.
