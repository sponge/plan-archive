Holy..I playd some DK Deathmatch last night..and it
was a fucking blast.  It actually supprised me.  I have
been playing the shit out of Half-Life Deathmatch, and
I love it.  But playing DK DM is a different experience,
a lot faster and actually more fun. The weapons look 
great, and the effects are awsome.  I love the Sidewinder
missle trail effect..it rules..thanks to Justin.  Also, 
the Ion Blaster, which used to be less than exciting
to shoot, is now ROCK HARD.  It hase a bad ass effect, 
and the sound rocks..thanks Stan....it just feels and 
looks like it is Electro-Ionizing everything in sight.

The DM level is bad ass too.  It is like this bad ass
base in the rain.  We have a great rain effect, and 
the rain sound makes me want to stay inside..and not 
go outside.  I love it when a level can have that 
effect on you. 

I can't wait until Andrew is able to get the Main...
......oh wait....can't say.  But is is going to be
bad ass. 

We are working to get this mutha BAD ASS..and it is great
to see those weapons take their final shape.  The team is
cranking and I am constantly amazed at how much we have
gotten done in the last month or two.

ALSO...Ludo..our French Art Wonder Man....is working on one
of the Cinematic sets,and it is just plain AWSOME!!!

AND THEN.................whew.....The E1 levels are looking
bad ass.  The level Bras and Brees have been working round
the clock to bring them up to snuff.  I can't say enough 
good things about our level crew, Cris is getting everything
bad ass..and the levels are really starting to come to life.
I can't wait until we get our trees and stuff in 
the swamp....it should look...well...swampy bad ass!!

Hold tight Buddies....

I want to go to the top of SHIT HILL!!!!!!!!!!!

I hate my hair...it is ruining my fucking life.

Do you ever have one of those days.  My life is all
screwed up right now.  I was at work pretty late 
last night, went home, slept like a rock, and now
I am totally exausted.  What gives?

Credit Speech.  I say having your credit ruined is 
good.  Why?  Well..so I can't finance $2000 here
$4000 there.  It forces you to save and pay cash, 
hence..you never get into hard core debt!  BAD ASS!!

Man..Daikatana is getting ROCK HARD!  We got this guy..Chris Perna
working on skinning stuff, and he RULES!!  Wait till you see some 
of his work.  We most recently had the Cerebus remodeled to look
more monster like..and the MODEL rules.  Well I asked Chris to 
skin that thing..and it looks TOUGH as hell.  The cerberus was 
one of the first things that was modeled for DK so it was not quite
up to snuff...but it is now baby.

Yes dudes.  I was sick and now I'm not.
That rules....being sick blows!!

This weekend I went to the best party ever.
I took in the following mind altering substances.

4 beers
5 rum 'n' cokes
5 GoldSchlager shots

And I didn't get sick..or have a hangover.  Does
this mean that I am GOD?  I think it does, so can
you all start calling me God?  Ok thanks.
