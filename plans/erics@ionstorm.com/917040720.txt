Man..Daikatana is getting ROCK HARD!  We got this guy..Chris Perna
working on skinning stuff, and he RULES!!  Wait till you see some 
of his work.  We most recently had the Cerebus remodeled to look
more monster like..and the MODEL rules.  Well I asked Chris to 
skin that thing..and it looks TOUGH as hell.  The cerberus was 
one of the first things that was modeled for DK so it was not quite
up to snuff...but it is now baby.

This weekend I went to the best party ever.
I took in the following mind altering substances.

4 beers
5 rum 'n' cokes
5 GoldSchlager shots

And I didn't get sick..or have a hangover.  Does
this mean that I am GOD?  I think it does, so can
you all start calling me God?  Ok thanks.
