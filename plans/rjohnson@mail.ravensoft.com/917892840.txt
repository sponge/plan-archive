   Hello?  Apple?  Are you in the fashion industry?  Or are you just 
      doing marketing gimmicks?

   I sure wish my PC would come in purple or green or blue?  

   And that stupid HAL commercial during the Superbowl trying to make it 
      look like the PC is to blame for the Y2K Bug, and that everything 
      on the Apple is perfect and has no Y2K problems.  Sure, the OS 
      may not have any problems, but beyond that, it is the individual 
      developer's responsibility to not use a 2 digit year.  That certainly 
      has nothing to do with PC manufactures.
