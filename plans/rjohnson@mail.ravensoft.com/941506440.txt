   ** Big SoF News **

   There is going to be a Linux port of both the client and server.  Unfortunately, because of the 
      lateness of this decision, it will not be ready by the time the game ships, but will be available 
      to download as soon as it is available (hopefully within a month of release).

   We have completed a major AVI and will be releasing it very soon.

   ---

   Little clarification, is that I guess the Linux version will be a separate retail product.

   Happy Halloween!

   Check out what the Avault had to say about their hands on experience with SoF at the Frag3.
      It is at the 1:00PM Time in the article.  Sounds like they only played the first level though...

   Monday I should have some important news about SoF...

   We're just about to go gold on one of the OEM versions of SoF (for Razer Mice).
      This version contains 4 Single Player levels.  This is by far, Raven's best game ever.  Finishing the full 
      game is just around the corner.

   Limited beta testing will probably start next week for SoF DM.  With the SP OEM out the door, most of us
      can concentrate on DM.  

   During the low times in the last few weeks, a few of us here have been playing zDoom and the mega.wad.
      I forgot how much fun these levels were, and just getting back to some classic doom DM.
