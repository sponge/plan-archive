   1.  Gil's been taking some more of my time today still
   2.  Ron, Steve, and Nathan have all joined in now.  They are looking over
       the scripting code, deathmatching, etc, to find all of the net abusing
       items
   3.  Got physics mostly working, except the player tends to get stuck on
       bsp models that have rotated.  Will have to look into this.
   4.  Going to get all of the particle types from H2 moved over

   Won't be able to get anything done on h2w today...gil is visiting

   1.  Would be nice if you could play a character other than the paladin :)
   2.  Going through the hcode to find any cases where sending network bytes
       may be different under qw (i.e. temp ents).
   3.  Adding the new temp ents for H2.  Also adding a new TE_CJR
   4.  Few weird quirks with temp ents, but they are mostly going.
   5.  Eric and I DM'd a bit - although I haven't touched the rendering aspect
       at all (implementing translucency and other stuff), the game was
       working pretty good, for only being a week old.  Net traffic was still
       high, but it should be, since the scripting code hasn't been touched
       at all.
   6.  Going to work on the physics


2/8/98
   1.  QW ran the physics a little different.  In H2, each entity only was
       execute once per physics call, even if the nextthink was set to the
       current time.  QW ran each entity until its nextthink was greater
       than current time.  This caused a few infinite loops on the server.
   2.  X-Files on tonight!

   Opinions:  If you loved the original Blues Brothers movie,
