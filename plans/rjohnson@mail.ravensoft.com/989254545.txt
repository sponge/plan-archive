   Some of our web sites, sof.ravensoft.com, eliteforce.ravensoft.com, 
      www2.ravensoft.com will be down for a short period of time as we are moving
      them over to a new web server.  Thank you, please drive through...

   We were going to release pictures of Raven staff actually working on a demo
      of SoF2 for E3, but instead, I have this little anecdote for you.
   
   On our Cub Foods run, several members of the late night Raven Posse were 
      heading back, and Brian Raffel was talking about his fixation of doughnuts, 
      "You know, the great thing about doughnuts is that you can only have one 
      or two of them, before you start to get sick."  And so I ask, "Hey Brian, 
      how many did you buy?"  "Three...  I couldn't resist, they were only 
      $0.25 each", was his reply.
