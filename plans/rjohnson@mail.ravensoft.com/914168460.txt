   In case you were wondering where to put the 4 new DM map files that
      were released a few days ago for Heretic2, you'll need to create
      two directories.  In your Heretic2 installation directory, create
      a directory called "base".  Inside of this new directory, create
      one called "maps".  Then place the DM maps in the "base/maps" directory.

   I was informed that today is the anniversary date of another game
      "release".  But finding out what this one is will take a little
      research on your part :)

   Well, after 3+ years of slow development, I've finally put out 
      the initial test release of Black Crypt, Raven's first game.

   Originally coded for the Commodore Amiga, you can now play it on
      the PC.  It should run on 95/98/NT 4.0 SP 3 with DX 3.0 or above, on
      a 486 and above, with 16 megs.  Remember that this is a complete conversion
      of the original game and that nothing has been modified.

   This first release includes only the first dungeon level (two playable
      levels).  This limited release is only to test the compatibility and
      stability of the conversion.  A future release will contain the 
      entire game.  The download is only 389k, so it is pretty small.

   Visit the Black Crypt Website for further information and to download
      the initial release.

   Enjoy!
