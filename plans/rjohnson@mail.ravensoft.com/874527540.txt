   Patch will be out very soon...  HC code and tools will be released soon
      afterwards.

   Once that has gone by, I'm going to begin the fun process of creating
      hexen2world.  Probably will take a few weeks, but don't hold me to it.

   This is just a test to see if the changes to the finger server program that
      I made are working :)

   If you point your web browsers to:  http://mail.ravensoft.com:79
      you will see my first rough cut of adding web support to the finger
      server.  I plan on adding additional features, so this is just the bare
      minimum.  I don't have the ability to send back graphics, yet, but if
      you have any html ideas on giving it a neat look without the use of
      graphics, send them to me (rjohnson@mail.ravensoft.com).
      BTW, if you are using a Netscape browser, and you tried this address,
      you will get something message about it being disabled for security
      reasons.  I don't see any reason for this at all, wrote netscape, but
      probably won't ever get a response.  I'll try to come up with a
      work-around for this later.

   FYI, the full version does have a very rare network bug that makes some
      entities disappear in your current area.  I've already found and
      corrected the problem, so this will be fixed once the patch is released.

   The patch will also probably include random class selection for DM games.

   There hasn't been any discussion on when utilities will be released, but
      probably not long after the patch and an OEM version is completed.

   Work is being done by Stefan at Rendidion for a Verite port.  I should be
      getting an alpha version soon.  I don't know when this will be made
      available to the public.

   We officially went Gold today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Though the work isn't done
      yet, as we will be releasing a patch in the near future.

   I would like to thank all of the people who have sacrificed their lives
      for the project here at Raven, Steve Stringer,
