   On vacation, and I'm still at work - yuck!

   Finished up the changes I needed to get into HW.  Once I get 2 taunts
      approved, then it will be uploaded.  If there are any severe problems
      with HW 0.12, they'll have to wait for a week (after I get back).

   After I get back from vacation, I'll be switching over to our next official
      product (Project XXX).  I'm not sure at what point Activision is planning
      on releasing details about it, so until then, I really can't say anything
      more, except maybe that it doesn't have anything to do with the Heretic /
      Hexen line.  I'll see if I can say that much :)

   Most of my vacation time is going to be spent finishing up Black Crypt.
      BC was Raven's first game, originally made for the Commodore Amiga and
      was released on March 18, 1992.  It is a role playing game, similar to
      Dungeon Master or Eye of Beholder, with about 25+ levels and plenty
      of monsters.  I started writing the port to Direct X way back when DX2
      was just out.  Haven't had a chance to put much time into it in over a
      year now, but plan on finishing it up.  Since it has been a much longer
      time frame than I have ever wanted for it, and since it doesn't offer
