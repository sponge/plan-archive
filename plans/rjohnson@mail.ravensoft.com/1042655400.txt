   *** ATTENTION MOD MAKERS ***

   Based on feedback we received at the mod maker round table sessions at QuakeCon, we created a private 
   forum for mod makers.  This forum is a place for all mod makers of all engines / games (not just Raven 
   games) to come and discuss any issues associated with mod making, such as programming, scripting, mapping,
   modeling, textures, sounds, etc.  This forum is only open to people actively involved in making content.  
   If you wish to join, create an account on our forums and then email me with your account name 
   and IÂ’ll give you access.  There is also a small website associated with this whole endeavor.  
   Again, this is for all people making mods for all games / engines.

   There's now a Black Crypt Website  I'll update with some news, screenshots, little tid bits
      about the game, etc.  Look for a release "soon"...

   Well, after a few years of a break, I started to re-port Black Crypt (Raven's original game on the Amiga)
      over to the PC again rendering it with GL.  I'm hoping to have it mostly finished by the end of the 
      Holiday Season.  I was going to try to convince *someone* to create a little web site for it, so that I can
      put up progress shots, etc.  Here's an initial picture of its current state.
      Remember that it is still in a very rough state, which is why there are a lot of mixed up things.

   Just wanted to make a quick update in saying that there has been a recent flood of fake Quake4 movies
      and trailers.  Everything on the internet is fake and nothing Quake4 related has ever been released,
      except for the one piece of concept art released at the initial announcement of the project.

   In answer to the trivia question below, it was The Transformers: The Movie

12/3/2002
   So I was watching this movie last night and saw something interesting in the credits, and figured this would
   make a good trivia question.  Name the movie which had both Leonard Nimoy and Weird Al Yankovic listed in 
   the ending credits!  No cheating by using the internet!

   For those Osbournes fans, SoF2 should make a very brief appearance on The Osbournes tonight on MTV.  
   Check your local listings, but the show should start at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT.

   Who else was completely annoyed last night watching Monday Night Football and hearing 
      that one noise maker in the audience being blown constantly?  Argh!

   Matt Morton, the producer for SoF2, has posted a list of some of the fixes/changes for the
      upcoming SoF2 patch.  This list does not include some new stuff that we are also adding.

   As promised, you can now get the SoF2 MP SDK Here!
   We'll have a forum se
