   The SoF V1.04 BETA patch will be out shortly.  Unfortunately, there was a last minute problem patching
      the main PAK file, so I had to remove those changes as well as the EAX changes (which required new data).
      RTPatch seems to crash on Win98 machines when I included that PAK file - I have to wait until Monday to
      get technical support from the people who make RTPatch.

   Remember that this version is a beta patch.  It mainly addresses DM server crashes.  We haven't done that
      much testing on this yet.

   This is the included readme file with the patch:

SoF V1.04
April 20, 2000
--------------
   * Fixed crash in EAX sound code when playing old sounds
   * Fixed crash in DM when getting killed by standing over a flaming body
   * Fixed crash in DM for Arsenal caused by weapon switching / inventory bug
   * Added a check for invalided saved game files in the menu code
   * Changed the "Error during Initialization" dialog to report the specific error
   * Added view height change for MOF
   * Fixed a bug in detection of remote IP address for systems with multiple IPs
   * Circumvented W2K bug in SetProcessWorkingSetSize().  This call would basically 
     not allow various GL implementations to initialize under W2K.  Removed the call 
     to that function.
   * Re-organized CD copy protection
   * Made it so that the winsock error WSAECONNRESET doesn't drop you to the console 
     during DM server browsing
   * Fixed problem where people had difficulty connecting to servers
   * Fixed an issue with spectator mode
   * Fixed an overflow issue with demo playback
   * Fixed CTF issue with force join
   * Added "ainame" worldspawn over-ride to specify the enemy set for user mods
   * Added a "-nostart" command line option, so that dedicated servers won't 
     automatically start dedicated.cfg
   * Fixed irqctf1 where players could get in bad spots
   * Fixed scripting problem in KOS3 where killing the helicopter 
   * EAX performance optimizations
   * Server Browers updates info when bringing up the status of a particular server
   * Automatic account login for dedicated servers
   * Clients connecting to dedicated servers no longer need a CD

Note: This patch should be considered BETA software and has not been fully tested.  
      You should re-install the game if you need to return to V1.03.
