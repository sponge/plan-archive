   Have you got the DOOM II GBA DM skills to pay the bills?
 
   Caryn 'Hellchick' Law and I have decided to throw down at this year's QuakeCon. We're bringing our 
      Gameboy Advances, DOOM II on the GBA, and link cables, and we're challenging QuakeCon gamers to take us 
      on in an old-school DOOM 2 deathmatch...but on the GBA. 
 
   We'll be bringing some swag to give away to anyone who can beat us (and you have to beat both of us) -- 
      DOOM t-shirts from id, Raven t-shirts, GBA games, whatever we can scrounge up between now and QuakeCon. 
 
   If you want to take us on, you'll need to bring two things: your own Gameboy Advance, and your own copy of 
      DOOM II for the GBA. We'll bring link cables to link up.
 
   When and where: we're not sure yet. As soon as we nail down our QuakeCon schedules, we'll announce when 
      and where you can show up to take us on. 
 
   Practice up, and we'll see you there.

   I saw Jewel this morning on the NBC Today show and she has completely switched her image to a Britney Spears pop star.
      I feel like she really sold out... ugh

   I put up a test verion of GL Black Crypt.  You can find it on the Black Crypt Website.

   Going to be putting out a simple test version of the GL port of Black Crypt in a few days.  Check out the Website.

   Just got a Toshiba PocketPC yesterday.  Can anyone recommend any good apps / games for it, as I'm fairly 
      new to the whole realm.

   Oh, and TomServo, stop rambling!  You are just making Paranoid Android more paranoid.  :)

   We are in the process of switching DNS entries for the SoF2 Master Server.  You may experience a disruption
      for a few days until the DNS changes propagate.  Here's a link to an explanation.

   *** ATTENTION MOD MAKERS ***

   Based on feedback we received at the mod maker round table sessions at QuakeCon, we created a private 
   forum for mod makers.  This forum is a place for all mod makers of all engines / games (not just Raven 
   games) to come and discuss any issues associated with mod making, such as programming, scripting, mapping,
   modeling, textures, sounds, etc.  This forum is only open to people actively involved in making content.  
   If you wish to join, create an account on our forums and then email me with your account name 
   and IÂ’ll give you access.  There is also a small website associated with this whole endeavor.  
   Again, this is for all people making mods for all games / en
