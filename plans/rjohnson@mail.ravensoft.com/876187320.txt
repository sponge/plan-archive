   There will be another patch to fix the patch (sounds like the intro credits
      to the Holy Grail) which will address:
      1.  The multiplayer crash bug
      2.  Save games from previous version loading in and giving you funny
          graphics.

   This will probably be available very shortly, and we are sorry for all of
      the inconviences that this has causes.  We will continue to address any
      future problems that may exist.

   Another release of the Rendition beta may be coming out tonight or early
      tomorrow.  This addresses some rendering glitches and problems where
      the game stops rendering, but continues to function.

   It was a great day!  Sorry about those Cowboy's, Scott, but you wanted a
      sloppy game :)

   Too painful to watch the Packers...
   Though if the Cowboys lose, it will be a good day

   The BETA version of the rendition port has been released.  You can download it from:
      http://www.users.wineasy.se/bjornt/files/vh2.zip
   You will also probably need new drivers:
      http://www.users.wineasy.se/bjornt/files/win95drv.zip
   Remember though, that both of these are still BETA versions.  You will need to upgrade
      your copy of Hexen 2 to V1.09, and the rendition version requires the original
      Hexen 2 CD in the drive prior to launching the program.

   With the patch out, I'll be able to start work on H2World on Tuesday
      (Monday, Steve Stringer is coming here to visit, probably wants to get
      some additional supplies for his sheep).  So with that, let's have a
      contest for the following areas:
         1. Client App Icon
         2. Server App Icon
         3. Better name than Hexen2World
         4. Changes to the background console image to reflect the new name

      Winners will receive, ummmm, their contribution included in the release
      and a hug from Chaos.

   *PATCH UPDATE* The file on Activision's WEST site was corrupt.  So if you
      have been getting a message about an invalid patch file (stops around
      94%), then download the patch from the EAST site, as this one does work.
      Sorry for any inconevience.

   Patch has been released!
      ftp://east.ftp.activision.com/activision/hexenII/Ph2v109.exe

   New command line parameter for the GL version:
      glh2 -scale2d

   The new version defaults to the non-scaled console / interface.  To put it
      back to the original way, use the above command.

   Official scripting source code and other utilities will be released very
      soon.

   Probably should have done this awhile ago, but finally added code to check
      and make sure a game was properly saved / loaded, as many people thought
      there were bugs in the saving process, but it was due to impartial saves
      because of no space available.

   I'll be going up north for the weekend, but I plan on diving into the
      quakeworld code to get familiar with it, and to start plans on making
      it into hexen2world.

9/25/97
   Non-scaled status bar and console will be include in the patch!

   Thanks for all the mail about H2W features.  I haven't had time yet to
      respond to any of them (working on the patch, oem version, gl updates,
      verite port (testing), mac port (info exchange), hcode/utils release),
      and trying to get over my cold / being sore from paintball, so I'm a
      little busy.   I should start on H2W early next week, so I'll probably
      start responding then.  Keep sending me any other ideas you have.

9/22/97
   If you can think of any simple features that are missing from quakeworld
      that you might want in hexen2world, now might be a good time to let me
      know (this does not include extern file support, as I don't have time to
      do that).

   Caught a cold, right before paintball tomorrow
