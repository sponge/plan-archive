   Have you got the DOOM II GBA DM skills to pay the bills?
 
   Caryn 'Hellchick' Law and I have decided to throw down at this year's QuakeCon. We're bringing our 
      Gameboy Advances, DOOM II on the GBA, and link cables, and we're challenging QuakeCon gamers to take us 
      on in an old-school DOOM 2 deathmatch...but on the GBA. 
 
   We'll be bringing some swag to give away to anyone who can beat us (and you have to beat both of us) -- 
      DOOM t-shirts from id, Raven t-shirts, GBA games, whatever we can scrounge up between now and QuakeCon. 
 
   If you want to take us on, you'll need to bring two things: your own Gameboy Advance, and your own copy of 
      DOOM II for the GBA. We'll bring link cables to link up.
 
   When and where: we're not sure yet. As soon as we nail down our QuakeCon schedules, we'll announce when 
      and where you can show up to take us on. 
 
   Practice up, and we'll see you there.

   I saw Jewel this morning on the NBC Today show and she has completely switched her image to a Britney Spears pop star.
      I feel like she really sold out... ugh

   I put up a test verion of GL Black Crypt.  You can find it on the Black Crypt Website.

4/11/2003
   Going to be putting out a simple test version of the GL port of Black Crypt in a few days.  Check out the Website.

   Just got a Toshiba PocketPC yesterday.  Can anyone recommend any good apps / games for it, as I'm fairly 
      new to the whole realm.

   Oh, and TomServo, stop rambling!  You are just making Paranoid Android more paranoid.  :)

   We are in the process of switching DNS entries for the SoF2 Master Server.  You may experience a disruption
      for a few days until the DNS changes propagate.  Here's a link to an explanation.

   *** ATTENTION MOD MAKERS ***

   Based on feedback we received at the mod maker round table sessions at QuakeCon, we created a private 
   forum for mod makers.  This forum is a place for all mod makers of all engines / games (not just Raven 
   games) to come and discuss any issues associated with mod making, such as programming, scripting, mapping,
   modeling, textures, sounds, etc.  This forum is only open to people actively involved in making content.  
   If you wish to join, create an account on our forums and then email me with your account name 
   and Ill give you access.  There is also a small website associated with this whole endeavor.  
   Again, this is for all people making mods for all games / engines.

   There's now a Black Crypt Website  I'll update with some news, screenshots, little tid bits
      about the game, etc.  Look for a release "soon"...

12/18/2002
   Well, after a few years of a break, I started to re-port Black Crypt (Raven's original game on the Amiga)
      over to the PC again rendering it with GL.  I'm hoping to have it mostly finished by the end of the 
      Holiday Season.  I was going to try to convince *someone* to create a little web site for it, so that I can
      put up progress shots, etc.  Here's an initial picture of its current state.
      Remember that it is still in a very rough state, which is why there are a lot of mixed up things.

   Just wanted to make a quick update in saying that there has been a recent flood of fake Quake4 movies
      and trailers.  Everything on the internet is fake and nothing Quake4 related has ever been released,
      except for the one piece of concept art released at the initial announcement of the project.

   In answer to the trivia question below, it was The Transformers: The Movie

12/3/2002
   So I was watching this movie last night and saw something interesting in the credits, and figured this would
   make a good trivia question.  Name the movie which had both Leonard Nimoy and Weird Al Yankovic listed in 
   the ending credits!  No cheating by using the internet!

11/26/2002
   For those Osbournes fans, SoF2 should make a very brief appearance on The Osbournes tonight on MTV.  
   Check your local listings, but the show should start at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT.

10/1/2002
   Who else was completely annoyed last night watching Monday Night Football and hearing 
      that one noise maker in the audience being blown constantly?  Argh!

9/18/2002
   Matt Morton, the producer for SoF2, has posted a list of some of the fixes/changes for the
      upcoming SoF2 patch.  This list does not include some new stuff that we are also adding.

5/23/2002
   As promised, you can now get the SoF2 MP SDK Here!
   We'll have a forum set up shortly for support, once I get the new server configured.

   The SDK includes game code, editors (radiant, fx, modeling, etc), tools (bsp, modeling, etc), documentation
      on various file formats, and some samples (skin files, map, etc).  The SDK is mainly MP specific, though
      there are some things which apply to the SP that are included.

   Enjoy!

   *** MASTER SERVER DOWNTIME ***

   We will be upgrading some internal hardware at Raven during the morning of Saturday,
      May 11th.  The master servers for Elite Force, Jedi Knight 2, and the SoF2 MP Test
      will be unavailable from around 9:00am Central Time to early early afternoon, given
      that everything goes smoothly.

   Bryan Dube, who is the other programmer on SoF2 MP, now has a finger account.  You
      may want to check out his latest .plan u
