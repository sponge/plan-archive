	Well, got back on late Sunday from a week down in Texas for QuakeCon.  I'm still trying to get caught up at work.  It was a blast meeting up with everyone again.

	Special thanks to Evil John and all of the volunteers who put together QuakeCon.  I can't even get my 4 computer router at home to not reset when I issue a tracert ( thanks LinkSys ), let alone image how one can piece together a 3000+ LAN in a matter of hours!

   Have you got the DOOM II GBA DM skills to pay the bills?
 
   Caryn 'Hellchick' Law and I have decided to throw down at this year's QuakeCon. We're bringing our 
      Gameboy Advances, DOOM II on the GBA, and link cables, and we're challenging QuakeCon gamers to take us 
      on in an old-school DOOM 2 deathmatch...but on the GBA. 
 
   We'll be bringing some swag to give away to anyone who can beat us (and you have to beat both of us) -- 
      DOOM t-shirts from id, Raven t-shirts, GBA games, whatever we can scrounge up between now and QuakeCon. 
 
   If you want to take us on, you'll need to bring two things: your own Gameboy Advance, and your own copy of 
      DOOM II for the GBA. We'll bring link cables to link up.
 
   When and where: we're not sure yet. As soon as we nail down our QuakeCon schedules, we'll announce when 
      and where you can show up to take us on. 
 
   Practice up, and we'll see you there.

   I saw Jewel this morning on the NBC Today show and she has completely switched her image to a Britney Spears pop star.
      I feel like she really sold out... ugh

   I put up a test verion of GL Black Crypt.  You can find it on the <a href="http://www.rickmus.com/BlackCrypt">Black Crypt Website</a>.

4/11/2003
   Going to be putting out a simple test version of the GL port of Black Crypt in a few days.  Check out the <a href="http://www.rickmus.com/BlackCrypt">Website</a>.

   Just got a Toshiba PocketPC yesterday.  Can anyone recommend any good apps / games for it, as I'm fairly 
      new to the whole realm.

   Oh, and TomServo, stop rambling!  You are just making Paranoid Android more paranoid.  :)

   We are in the process of switching DNS entries for the SoF2 Master Server.  You may experience a disruption

   *** ATTENTION MOD MAKERS ***

   Based on feedback we received at the mod maker round table sessions at QuakeCon, we created a private 
   forum for mod makers.  This forum is a place for all mod makers of all engines / games (not just Raven 
   games) to come and discuss any issues associated with mod making, such as programming, scripting, mapping,
   modeling, textures, sounds, etc.  This forum is only open to people actively involved in making content.  
   If you wish to join, create an account on our <a href="http://forums.ravensoft.com/ib/ikonboard.pl">forums</a> and then <a href="mailto:rjohnson@ravensoft.com">email me</a> with your account name 
   and I’ll give you access.  There is also a <a href="http://mods.ravensoft.com">small website</a> associated with this whole endeavor.  
   Again, this is for all people making mods for all games / engines.

   There's now a <a href="http://www.rickmus.com/BlackCrypt">Black Crypt Website</a>  I'll update with some news, screenshots, little tid bits
      about the game, etc.  Look for a release "soon"...

12/18/2002
   Well, after a few years of a break, I started to re-port Black Crypt (Raven's original game on the Amiga)
      over to the PC again rendering it with GL.  I'm hoping to have it mostly finished by the end of the 
      Holiday Season.  I was going to try to convince *someone* to create a little web site for it, so that I can
      put up progress shots, etc.  Here's an initial <a href="http://www.rickmus.com/bc/bc.jpg">picture</a> of its current state.
      Remember that it is still in a very rough state, which is why there are a lot of mixed up things.

12/7/2002
   Just wanted to make a quick update in saying that there has been a recent flood of fake Quake4 movies
      and trailers.  Everything on the internet is fake and nothing Quake4 related has ever been released,
      except for the one piece of concept art released at the initial announcement of the project.

   In answer to the trivia question below, it was The Transformers: The Movie

12/3/2002
   So I was watching this movie last night and saw something interesting in the credits, and figured this would
   make a good trivia question.  Name the movie which had both Leonard Nimoy and Weird Al Yankovic listed in 
   the ending credits!  No cheating by using the internet!

11/26/2002
   For those Osbournes fans, SoF2 should make a very brief appearance on The Osbournes tonight on MTV.  
   Check your local listings, but the show should start at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT.

10/1/2002
   Who else was completely annoyed last night watching Monday Night Football and hearing 
      that one noise maker in the audience being blown constantly?  Argh!

9/18/2002
   Matt Morton, the producer for SoF2, has <a href="http://forums.ravensoft.com/ib/ikonboard.pl?act=ST;f=1;t=10543">posted</a> a list of some of the fixes/changes for the
      upcoming SoF2 patch.  This list does not include some new stuff that we are also adding.

5/23/2002
   As promised, you can now get the SoF2 MP SDK <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?/planetsoldieroffortune/files/sof2mpsdk.msi">Here!</a>
   We'll have a forum set up shortly for support, once I get the new server configured.

   The SDK includes game code, editors (radiant, fx, modeling, etc), tools (bsp, modeling, etc), documentation
      on various file formats, and some samples (skin files, map, etc).  The SDK is mainly MP specific, though
      there are some things which apply to the SP that are included.

   Enjoy!

   *** MASTER SERVER DOWNTIME ***

   We will be upgrading some internal hardware at Raven during the morning of Saturday,
      May 11th.  The master servers for Elite Force, Jedi Knight 2, and the SoF2 MP Test
      will be unavailable from around 9:00am Central Time to early early afternoon, given
      that everything goes smoothly.

5/3/2002
   Bryan Dube, who is the other programmer on SoF2 MP, now has a finger account.  You
      may want to check out his latest .plan update, as that has a list of all of the
      items we've adjusted / changed / fixed, based upon the feedback we received from
      the public test of SoF2MP.

4/22/2002
   We've put together a <a href="http://sof2.ravensoft.com/sof2mptesthelp.htm">quick summary</a> of useful cvars / commands for server operators
      and clients.  This document includes information on how to change movement speed, changing weapon availability, 
      and various other items.

4/18/2002
   If you are playing SoF2 MP Test and can't connect to any servers because of an
      invalid game version, you are playing with leaked version.  You must download
      the official version that was released today!

4/15/2002
   Tax Day, yeah!

   We've been getting a lot of emails to the SoF2 MP test feedback account for people
      wishing to sign up to participate in the SoF2 MP Test this Thursday.  This test
      will be available to the general public.  You do NOT need to sign up for it.

4/11/2002
   Based upon <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/previews/april02/sof2/">this article</a>, I'm hereby announcing 
   <b>Rick Johnson's Quake 4</b>  hehe

   In all seriousness, I'm usually not one to try and get fame or take too much credit in this industry.  So
      I just wanted to make sure and let everyone know that the whole MP and SP portions of SoF2 are done as
      a team effort.  We all make various contributions to the project.

   SOF2 RMG MP came about as a "challenge" over Thanksgiving weekend.  We had never planned on putting it
      in MP, purely from a time point of view, but I had always felt that it would be something very cool.
      Bryan Dube and I both had nothing to do over Thanksgiving, so I came up with the foolish idea that we
      would try to get the core technology of the SP RMG over to MP.  So we worked on this over the four day 
      holiday, not telling anyone (didn't want to get their hopes up, expectations, etc).  We were able to
      get it mostly in and working by the end of that time and conducted our first test early the following
      week.

   I've been hosting a private beta test of portions of SoF2 MP for the last month.  We've had RMG games up to
      50 people.  One of the most fascinating things about the RMG is that when you first enter the map, you'll
      see it up on the automap, and your first reaction is, "There's no way this map will be fun".  But then,
      then it does.  It is interesting to watch how various tactics develop based upon each unique map.

   I wanted to publicly thank the beta testers who helped us find bugs, give game play feedback, etc.  They
      were a tremendous help in improving the overall quality of MP, as you'll soon see.

   "Due to the increased costs of running the EverQuest game service, and constantly 
    adding new and challenging content, we will be increasing our subscription rates

   Thank goodness they got one automatic thing working!  I always love paying more!
   So now I have to go home tonight, download the huge patch, just so that I can cancel 
   my account!  Who's with me???!!!

   Anyone else getting this spam email "Bill Jones for California Governor" ?  I've gotten 4 today!
      He's certainly not getting my vote!!!!

   Spam is getting bad enough, especially with the government really not doing anything about it.  And
      now I'm getting spam email for people running for government.  If he gets elected (if it is a legit
      thing and not some internet hoax), you really think he would do anything to limit spam.  Some one
      needs to do something about all of this junk!

   Just a little update - been really busy working on JK2 MP and SoF2 MP.  We've been tracking down some
      legacy Q3A bugs, including the famous "invisible player bug".  That was a nasty one to track down; 
      took 3-4 days of solid work looking over network code, gathering information, running tests, etc.

1/24/2002
   I’ve been waiting to do this announcement in order to get a few decent screen shots, but I seem to 
      have the artistic talent of taking nothing but boring shots, so I’ll do this without them for now.

   We’ve been busy working on the SoF2 MP and so I’ll announce a few features, which haven’t been 
      announced until now.  The first big one is that the Random Mission Generator will be included 
      with MP.  This includes both the dynamic terrain generation technology and the BSP instantiation 
      (buildings, walls, other pre-fab stuff).  MOD makers will be able to easily create their own 
      generation parameters in the external files, add in unique instances, etc.  There’re a few 
      other surprises in this area that I’ll hold off announcing.

   The next technology that we’ve added to MP is a flexible game-type creation system.  You create a 
      simple script which defines the entire parameters of the game type.  Maps, with a few minor 
      changes, can easily support new game types.  For example, we have CTF implement via this system, 
      as well as two other game types, all of which will ship with the game.  One interesting feature 
      that has been added is the ability to purchase weapons during each mission phase.  The designer 
      places “buy” areas inside the map, and while the player (on the right team) is inside this area, 
      you’ll be able to go to a menu to purchase weapons, ammo, armor, etc.  The script can then reward 
      money to the player based upon the various outcomes that are defined.

   Both of these two core technologies can be combined, as we do have randomly generated CTF going.  
      In all, this should add some unique flavor to SoF2 MP that hasn’t been seen before, as well 
      as make life a little easier for MOD makers.

   Non-Raven news.  A year ago, I worked on a GameBoy Color game in my spare time, just as a side project
      and to have a little fun.  I never finished it, and so I decided that I'll be placing the source
      code out for the public.  I'm not sure when I'll get around to doing this, as my spare time is in
      short supply.  I'll update my .plan file at some point in the future once I've put out all the files.


1/8/2002
   I've been following a few mailing lists of people doing some work with programmable
      logic devices (one person is attempting to make an updated version of the Commodore
      64).  I was thinking of just trying to fiddle around with doing something like this,
      only on a much simpler scale, as a hobby in a way.  But I'm not sure where to begin.  
      So if anyone out there has any experience with these sort of devices and would be 
      willing to point me in the right direction on what I would need to purchase to get going, 
      that would be most appreciated.

   Sometime shortly, I'll also have a pretty cool announcement about SoF2 MP.

   Well, I’m back from QuakeCon, still trying to catch up on my sleep.  Just wanted 
      to say Hi to everyone that I met – had a blast down there, especially announcing 
      Quake 4.  Met up with a bunch of people from Ritual, Nerve, and even George 
      Broussard himself.  I heard that he was giving away free copies of Max Payne - pretty cool!
      Also wanted to say thanks to id Software for putting on this event for their fans.

   I held two sessions on “What do you want in Quake 4” as well as attended the JK2 
      presentations and a group discussion with mod people.  It was interesting 
      listening to the mod people, their concerns and gripes.  Hopefully I’ll be 
      back next year to participate even more in these discussions to help shape Quake 4.

7/9/2001
   Well, unfortunately, the SoF 1.07 patch that was released on Friday had a crash bug
      in it.  You should download the <a href = "http://sof.ravensoft.com/download/sof107fBetaPatch.exe">1.07f Beta patch</a>.  You will need
      to re-install 1.06 first, then apply this patch.  From all of the reports that I've
      read on our message board, this clears up all issues.  Make sure that when you are in
      the main menu, that the version in the lower right says 1.07f

   There were several reasons why QA didn't catch this bug, even though it was blatant when
      the patch was released to the public.  It is one of those bugs which is difficult to find
      in QA, given that they don't have the dynamics of people on the internet nor the sheer
      amount of people.  I do apologize for this incident, and hopefully we'll find a better
      approach in the future, such as a limited beta release.

6/13/2001
   Wednesday the 13th!

   As you may have read, we will be releasing a patch for SoF which will be adding
      direct GameSpy support.  We've also addressed a few minor deathmatch issues.
      The patch is going through QA and should be out "soon".  Around that time, I will
      also release a new SDK for SoF which will contain the SoF Gold Game source.

   We were going to release pictures of Raven staff actually working on a demo
      of SoF2 for E3, but instead, I have this little anecdote for you.
   
   On our Cub Foods run, several members of the late night Raven Posse were 
      heading back, and Brian Raffel was talking about his fixation of doughnuts, 
      "You know, the great thing about doughnuts is that you can only have one 
      or two of them, before you start to get sick."  And so I ask, "Hey Brian, 
      how many did you buy?"  "Three...  I couldn't resist, they were only 
      $0.25 each", was his reply.
