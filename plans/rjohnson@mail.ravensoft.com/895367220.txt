   With the new QW released, Zoid will be sending me those changes
      to be incorporated into HW.  We'll then put out a new version
      of HW to test compatibility and stability.  After that, we'll
      release probably what will be the final version of HW.  Zoid
      also said he'll compile a few unix ports of the server
      (only those flavors which run on Intel), and so unix versions
      will be released along with that.

   Decided to talk a little about all of the lawsuits being filed
      against Microsoft.  I've come to the conclusion that the lawsuits
      are a waste of time, tax payer dollars, and ultimately will do
      more harm than good.

   What's the big deal with Microsoft including Internet Explorer 
      with its OS?  Although not on the same scale, it is not different
      than Microsoft including Word Pad, Paint, HyperTerminal, and
      the other built in games.  There are all commercial products 
      of these things, though with many more features.  Yet, no one is
      throwing a fuss over them.  Microsoft has included these products
      ever since Win 3.0.  But somehow, including Internet Explorer 
      is different.  And yes, I do know Microsoft signed some deal with
      the Justice Department, but that's not my point.

   Oh, one other thing about CGDC that I forgot.  A certain hardware
      company was using a statement by John Carmack to hype up its
      products.  A spokesman for the company was saying something like
      "That even John Carmack recommends our card for his Earth Quake 
      and Earth Quake 2 games."  hehe
