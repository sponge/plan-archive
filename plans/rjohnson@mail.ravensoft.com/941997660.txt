   So you're waiting for the SoF AVI?  Well, here's something to wet your appetitie.  This 
 Song was an impromptu recording by the actor that plays John Mullins in
      SoF.  This was just a little fun thing that Chia-Chin Lee had him record.  This isn't actually 
      going to be included in the game...  Enjoy!

 Please note that this song is intended for mature audiences.  Parental discretion is advised.

   The comments about playing it for a brief try were not directed towards the avault article at all.  
      The article as a whole is very fair, and actually is very favorable towards SoF.  The reviewer
      did play the OEM extensively and walked away not fully liking our difficulty settings.  That's fine, and
      this is already address for the final product.  What frustrates developers the most is when
      people dislike options without either trying it or just playing it "for a bit".  Most of the time,
      features will grow upon you.

   --------

   I hate it when people make assumptions about games prior to ever playing it or just giving it a brief 
      try.  Open up your minds, otherwise you'll be stuck with the same game play forever :)

   The guys respawn...  They spawn out of logical places where more enemies would naturally flow in.
      They also respawn based upon the amount of "noise" you are generating.  If you use louder weapons,
      you'll attract more attention to yourself.  Quieter weapons, you'll attract less attention, and you
      won't see as many people.

   Limited saves...  It does add very much to the realism.  People were skeptical here, but turned out it that
      it made you in the game more "mortal" and tightened up your senses.

   But, having said that, one option which did NOT make it into the OEM is a customizable difficulty setting,
      where you can control the number of saves (or unlimited), no respawning, AI difficulty, etc.  So if you
      don't like our defaults for the standard difficulties presented to you, you can always do your own custom
      settings.  This was always planned since day 1.  I'm a big fan of limited saves, but there will always be
      people with different tastes...

   ** Big SoF News **

   There is going to be a Linux port of both the client and server.  Unfortunately, because of the 
      lateness of this decision, it will not be ready by the time the game ships, but will be available 
      to download as soon as it is available (hopefully within a month of release).

   We have completed a major AVI and will be releasing it very soon.

   ---

   Little clarification, is that I guess the Linux version will be a separate retail product.

   Happy Halloween!

   Check out what the Avault had to say about their hands on experience with SoF at the Frag3.
      It is at the 1:00PM Time in the article.  Sounds
