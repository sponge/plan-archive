   Be aware, there is a <a href = "http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.eira.57344@mm.html">Virus</a> going around pretending to be a Quake4 demo.
   Of course there is no Quake4 demo!

   Well, I’m back from QuakeCon, still trying to catch up on my sleep.  Just wanted 
      to say Hi to everyone that I met – had a blast down there, especially announcing 
      Quake 4.  Met up with a bunch of people from Ritual, Nerve, and even George 
      Broussard himself.  I heard that he was giving away free copies of Max Payne - pretty cool!
      Also wanted to say thanks to id Software for putting on this event for their fans.

   I held two sessions on “What do you want in Quake 4” as well as attended the JK2 
      presentations and a group discussion with mod people.  It was interesting 
      listening to the mod people, their concerns and gripes.  Hopefully I’ll be 
      back next year to participate even more in these discussions to help shape Quake 4.

   Well, unfortunately, the SoF 1.07 patch that was released on Friday had a crash bug
      in it.  You should download the <a href = "http://sof.ravensoft.com/download/sof107fBetaPatch.exe">1.07f Beta patch</a>.  You will need
      to re-install 1.06 first, then apply this patch.  From all of the reports that I've
      read on our message board, this clears up all issues.  Make sure that when you are in
      the main menu, that the version in the lower right says 1.07f

   There were several reasons why QA didn't catch this bug, even though it was blatant when
      the patch was released to the public.  It is one of those bugs which is difficult to find
      in QA, given that they don't have the dynamics of people on the internet nor the sheer
      amount of people.  I do apologize for this incident, and hopefully we'll find a better
      approach in the future, such as a limited beta release.

   Wednesday the 13th!

   As you may have read, we will be releasing a patch for SoF which will be adding
      direct GameSpy support.  We've also addressed a few minor deathmatch issues.
      The patch is going through QA and should be out "soon".  Around that time, I will
      also release a new SDK for SoF which will contain the SoF Gold Game source.

   Some of our web sites, sof.ravensoft.com, eliteforce.ravensoft.com, 
      www2.ravensoft.com will be down for a short period of time as we are moving
      them over to a new web server.  Thank you, please drive through...

   We were going to release pictures of Raven staff actually working on a demo
      of SoF2 for E3, but instead, I have this little anecdote for you.
   
   On our Cub Foods run, several members of the late night Raven Posse were 
      heading back, and Brian Raffel was talking about his fixation of doughnuts, 
      "You know, the great thing about doughnuts is that you can only have one 
      or two of them, before you start to get sick."  And so I ask, "Hey Brian, 
      how many did you buy?"  "Three...  I couldn't resist, they were only 
      $0.25 each", was his reply.
