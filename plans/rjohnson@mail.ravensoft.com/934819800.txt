   Rental of Garner Park ... $25
   Catering of the company picnic ... $350
 Kim Lathrop, unknowingly getting locked up in the observation tower by park officials and having to 
      call the police to eventually use bolt cutters to set him free ..... priceless
   For everything else, there's Mastercard...

   Now that we have deathmatch initially up and running, tweaking it, adding various games, etc.
      I would like to ask people to email any common Quake2 deathmatch / network problems to
 sof-deathmatch@ravensoft.com.  This would
      include bugs, cheats, strange problems, etc., or even desired features.  Please include as 
      verbose of a description as possible.  Please note that this is not a guarantee that these
      items will be address or fixed, but if we can keep them in mind, we may be able to find solutions
      or workarounds.

   Networking in SoF vs Q2 has changed significantly.  Ghoul uses a network system where that everything
      is based off of sequences, not of frames.  So the client gets a much more smoother appearance
      of the sequences playing out.

   GenCon was a lot of fun this year.  SoF was a very big hit, along with Trek.  Check out the
