There so many exciting things going on these days around Monolith, every time I turn around
some new cool thing has been created its hard to keep up with all this magic brewing that's for sure.

We are all looking forward to "GRUNTZ" being released, if you have not tried the demo its worth checkin out, its crazy fun.

Speaking of crazy fun "SANITY" is looking fantastic, I guarantee this product will be a whole new 
gaming experience, everyone will be hearing more about this.
