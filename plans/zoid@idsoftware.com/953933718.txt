Feb 25th/2000

In September of 1996, I made a small modification to the popular id Software 
game Quake and called it ThreeWave Capture the Flag.  That simple
modification grew into the last three and a half years of working with 
id Software and the Quake community.  The job that id Software gave me
over this period has been very rewarding.  It has also been a lot of fun.
I have enjoyed watching the community grow.  I was also overwhelmed at 
having been able to work on a series of some of the most amazing games ever 
created.  But, like all good things, it must come to an end.

I feel that I have learned a lot in my time with id, but I find myself 
looking for new challenges. I have decided that in order to pursue them, 
I must leave my association with id Software.  Having done so, I plan 
on exploring new opportunities.

My contract with id terminates at the end of this month (Feb).  My 
zoid@idsoftware.com address will probably stop forwarding to my permanent
address shortly after that.  My permanent address is 
<a href="mailto:zoid@threewave.com">zoid@threewave.com</a> 
for people that wish to reach me.

I would like to thank id Software (and especially John Carmack) for giving 
me such great opportunities, and allowing me to work with all the talented
people there.  I am going to miss it.

In March, I will begin a new position at Retro Studios, 
<a href="http://www.retrostudios.com/">http://www.retrostudios.com/</a>.  
I look forward to joining the team there and working on some exciting new 
projects.

So long and thanks for all the captures.
