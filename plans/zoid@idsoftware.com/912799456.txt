As John Cash mentioned in his plan, 3.20 is the final patch for Quake2.  The
3.20 beta testing went very well so we have stamped it as official.  We
won't be doing another update on the Quake2 code base unless something major 
shows up (like a serious DoS attack or bug).

The Quake2 upgrade path has a bit bumpy (3.15's air control), but overall
the path was to solve two essential needs (a) address bugs/security issues
such as DoS (denial of service) attacks, and (b) provide new features.

I hope the mod makers out there are excited now that we've released the
new updated game code--including the Xatrix and Rogue game code as well.
It has been a long time coming, but we wanted to make sure that when we
re-released it, it wasn't going to change again a couple weeks later.
It's going to be good to see the new features added to all the existing mods
out there such as IP banning, flood protection and spectating.

I also was recently interviewed by TC over at 
<a href="http://www.dailydementia.com/">The Daily Dementia</a>.  It's an audio
interview that you need the <a href="http://www.real.com/">Real DooHickey</a>
(to quote Blue) in order to listen to.  I enjoyed doing the interview and
ended up talking about all sorts of stuff.

I've been really enjoy two very cool games lately.  SIN and HalfLife have been
a blast to play over the last week or so.  

SIN was a little bumpy out the gate but the new patch makes it a lot cleaner.  
You gotta wonder what those Ritual guys are doing in the wee hours of the 
morning to come up that new ParadoX level.  Though it should have really been 
called <a href="http://www.worldofescher.com/gallery/Relativity.html">Relativity</a> in honour of MC Escher's wonderful art.  
I enjoy running around as JC in deathmatch since he makes that corniest 
wisecracks and looks like a punk.  Most of the guns are bigger than he is!
Congratulations to the Ritual boys on putting out a kick-ass game.

Half Life has been a real joy to play as well.  The single game experience
is completely different than a game such as Q2 or SIN, but in a really
positive way.  The immersion is very effective in HL.  HL's visuals are
extremely well done, but they are beautiful in their accuracy as opposed to
their 'gee-wizz-bang' graphics you see in most FPS games.  HL's visuals
look real and everything is there because that's they way it would be.
A big round of applause for the Valve crew for putting out a great game.

I think both need a CTF multiplayer mode, tho.  :)

From <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com">Blue's News</a>:<br>

<blockquote>
"Today marks the two-year anniversary of the day the first-ever story about
Capture the Flag appeared anywhere, right here on Blue's News. I was on
a trip to Virginia and it really seems like the "old days," because I was
updating on a monochrome 486SX laptop, using a flaky 14.4 AOL connection,
and I can still remember the email from Zoid that had such a strong hook."
</blockquote>

I remember writing that email to Blue.  When I realized that CTF was going to
catch on (the sheer number of people fighting to get into my two little
twelve player servers was astounding), I wrote mail that would "sell"
the product, so to speak.  I knew I built something cool and I wanted tell
everyone about it.

I guess everyone heard about it by now.  :)

CTF has been an amazing project for me.  From my humble beginings on a little
NetQuake server running a little hack with floating keys to Quake2 CTF.
It's been fun building it all, and it's going to be a challenge to continue
the tradition of simple gameplay, but addictive design.

Speaking of Q2CTF, I've begun some layout plans for an addon level pak.
Players have been screaming for more "official" quality levels and I think
it's past due time for some to be made.  No time line yet, but I'm hoping
to get a new pak together soon for all your CTF fanatics out there.

Thanks to Blue for wishing me a Happy Anniversary and a special thanks to all
the players out there that enjoyed ThreeWave Capture the Flag and made it
what it is today.  It was your feedback and desire to play a game that
drove me to build it and continue to make it better.

"Zoid captured the BLUE flag!"  :)
