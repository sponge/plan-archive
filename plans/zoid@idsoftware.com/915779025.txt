A new release of Quake2 CTF is now available.  This and is an official 
release of the previous 1.09 beta that was made available earlier and
also includes three new maps.

What this adds is:

- Full timed competition mode
- Voted admins who can change maps/kick players
- Three new maps
- Full VWep support
- More server adminstrative functions such as sv_maplist, IP banning, etc.

The new maps are:

q2ctf6 - Borders Canyon
  Original map by Zoid in base style without side canyons.
q2ctf7 - Boxed In
  Based off a Rogue: Ground Zero dethmatch level of the same name.
  Original map by Jim Molinets, CTF version by Zoid.
  Warehouse style map with many paths and twisting cooridors.
q2ctf8 - The Hangar Scenario
  Original map by Mike "]BC]Casey" Goodhead.
  Large open map with large hangar rooms to fight in.

***NOTE:  The additional maps come in a pak1.pak that go into your CTF
directory.  If you already have a third party addon in your Quake2/CTF
directory, you will have to rename it to pak2.pak or a higher number since
the Quake2 CTF 1.50 installers will overwrite any existing pak1.pak (with
confirmation).
