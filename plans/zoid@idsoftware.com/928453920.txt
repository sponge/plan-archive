Recent changes I've been making:

- New vmsg and vmsg_team client to server and server to client command.  
This is the same as say and say_team, except it takes the name of a sound 
file to play along with the message.
- Major additions to the client menu system for new team messaging menus 
for pre-recorded model sayings.  The menu system stuffs vmsg commands to 
perform its work.
- Fixed it so that a player is only killed when switching teams, not 
to/from spectator mode.
- CTF team spawn points are in, team_CTF_redplayer and team_CTF_blueplayer.  
They are only used at game start, subsequent spawns are in deathmatch 
starts.  Plans to have team only bits on dm starts as well?
- Added two new system functions, Sys_DefaultCDPath() and 
Sys_DefaultBasePath().  These establish the default base and cd path 
directories.  Under Windows, they are both set to current dir by default.  
In Unix, they are set to argv[0]'s path and $HOME/.q3a/ 
respectively.  This allows storing the q3config.cfg in $HOME/.q3a/baseq3 
under Unix for per-user execution and settings.
- If a double signal fault occurs in Linux, exit immediately.
- stubs for Linux SMP.  
- Reworked the Linux sound drivers based on recommendations by the 4Front 
guys.  Added support for 48KHz output and reorganized the sound driver 
setup and initialization sequence.
- added NET_Sleep(msec) call in server code to allow proper CPU throttling.  
Wakes up on packet or stdin under Unix.
