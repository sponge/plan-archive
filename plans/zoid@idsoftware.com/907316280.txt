From Blue's News:



"Today marks the two-year anniversary of the day the first-ever story about
Capture the Flag appeared anywhere, right here on Blue's News. I was on
a trip to Virginia and it really seems like the "old days," because I was
updating on a monochrome 486SX laptop, using a flaky 14.4 AOL connection,
and I can still remember the email from Zoid that had such a strong hook."


I remember writing that email to Blue.  When I realized that CTF was going to
catch on (the sheer number of people fighting to get into my two little
twelve player servers was astounding), I wrote mail that would "sell"
the product, so to speak.  I knew I built something cool and I wanted tell
everyone about it.

I guess everyone heard about it by now.  :)

CTF has been an amazing project for me.  From my humble beginings on a little
NetQuake server running a little hack with floating keys to Quake2 CTF.
It's been fun building it all, and it's going to be a challenge to continue
the tradition of simple gameplay, but addictive design.

Speaking of Q2CTF, I've begun some layout plans for an addon level pak.
Players have been screaming for more "official" quality levels and I think
it's past due time for some to be made.  No time line yet, but I'm hoping
to get a new pak together soon for all your CTF fanatics out there.

Thanks to Blue for wishing me a Happy Anniversary and a special thanks to all
the players out there that enjoyed ThreeWave Capture the Flag and made it
what it is today.  It was your feedback and desire to play a game that
drove me to build it and continue to make it better.

"Zoid captured the BLUE flag!"  :)
