In an attempt to clean up some of my clutter, the following is for sale:

One seven story office building, located in beautiful downtown
Mesquite, Texas. This building includes office suite 666, the
historic suite where id Software developed hit titles such as
Quake and Quake II. For a nominal extra fee, the building can 
be autographed by the Rouge Entertainment staffer of your 
choice.
