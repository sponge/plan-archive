Thanks to all the people who've written in so far about Alice
ports. 

I would ask you to only request ports that you'll actually go
out and buy. We have a pretty good idea of what machines we'd like
to port to, but need to know whether the sales are going to be there
to justify the costs.

Thanks.

We'd like to pose this question:  What platforms would you 
like to possibly see Alice ported to?

Please send your thoughts to: aliceports@rogue-ent.com.

This is not a guarantee that Alice will come to any platform
other than Windows, but we would like to gauge people's interest.

Thanks.
