Plan:
November 18, 1998

Time for the semiannual plan update again?

A few items to talk about. First, the next update of
Radiant should rock your world. I swear I saw
something moving in there...

Second, to complement Pat's update of the other day, you 
might want to try running the Xatrix (Q2 MP1) maps under Rogue
deathmatch.  We don't incorporate the Xatrix weapons and 
powerups, but we do automatically replace them with Ground 
Zero toys. Try it out and you'll find spheres, proximity
mines, the ETF Rifle and the Plasma beam waiting for
you.

This is not a supported feature.

To run the Xatrix stuff under Ground Zero, copy their
pak0.pak file from \quake2\xatrix to \quake2\baseq2 and
rename it pak3.pak or some other unused number. Then
just run it like this:

quake2 +set game rogue +map xdm2

Enjoy...

BTW, the Star Wars Episode 1 trailer kicks ass.
