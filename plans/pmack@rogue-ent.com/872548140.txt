Plan:
The Quake RSA team web site is active, so if you're on the
team or interested in the effort, check it out. The address
is http://www2.rogue-ent.com/rc5/ and it's got the essentials
you need to know.

Also, there is new client software becoming available on the
main site (http://rc5.distributed.net/) that has cool new
features and gives you a 25-47% speed improvement on intel
machines. Go grab it...

We've fallen quite a bit in the standings, so crank those
machines back up. Also, tell your friends, convince your
co-workers, usurp those school machines!
