-[ Joey Liaw Leaves ]-

Apparently there are more young women (young being a maximum of  14
in this case) out in California.  Or maybe it's more Anime.  Actually, now
that I think about it, I'm sure it's both.

What am I talking about?  A good friend is leaving out midst, bringing about
the end of an era.  Joey Liaw, programmer on Anacrhonox for ION Storm, is
finally heading off to college after a one-year hiatus from the formal 
education thing.

He graced us (us meaning the Dallas area developers and friends lucky 
enough to have known him) with his complete lack of humor and amazing 
hardware-hoarding ways for an entire year.  Alas, I moved out to Dallas only
a little more than 6 months ago... but it's been an enlightening experience
being around and dealing with Joey.

He's quite a character, and a good friend.  I'm sure he'll do very well out
at Stanford, and lucky for me, my family lives out there so I can still 
harass him on visits.  I'm not convinced that he'll be able to leave the lure
of making video games, however, despite what he says over ION's website.  
We'll see.

Anyway, I suppose all good things must come to an end.  It's been wonderful
knowing you, Joey, and I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say that we'll
enjoy harassing you from afar, even if it's not quite as satisyfing.  Oh, yes,
and anytime you want to get shown how to really play DOOM, you know my number.

-[ Creative SoundBlaster Live! ]-

Got a few emails today from people asking if I've tested the quality and
performance of the SB Live! yet.  The answer is no - I don't have a card to
test with.  :)

If/When I do, I promise I'll post my thoughts and observations here...  And
I do know some stuff about their A3D emulation, but I want to hear it 
first-hand before saying anything...

-[ Linux Sin? ]-

Now that the demo's out, there's a strong possibility that we'll start 
work on the Linux Sin port soon.

I've already emailed those who responded to me earlier about doing the
Sin Linux port, but if there are any more of you out there, we're looking
for a volunteer to port Sin over to Linux.  And you must live in or near
Dallas.

Email me (onethumb@ritual.com) if you're interested.
