-[ Creative SoundBlaster Live! ]-

Got a few emails today from people asking if I've tested the quality and
performance of the SB Live! yet.  The answer is no - I don't have a card to
test with.  :)

If/When I do, I promise I'll post my thoughts and observations here...  And
I do know some stuff about their A3D emulation, but I want to hear it 
first-hand before saying anything...

-[ Linux Sin? ]-

Now that the demo's out, there's a strong possibility that we'll start 
work on the Linux Sin port soon.

I've already emailed those who responded to me earlier about doing the
Sin Linux port, but if there are any more of you out there, we're looking
for a volunteer to port Sin over to Linux.  And you must live in or near
Dallas.

Email me (onethumb@ritual.com) if you're interested.
