-[ Gamecenter? Are you awake? ]-

Gamecenter, C|Net's gaming news area, seems to have lost it's mind a bit.
While I totally agree they have a right to their own opinions, when they 
blatantly misrepresent the facts, I think that's stepping over the line.  How
are people supposed to vote their mind when the facts aren't even correct?

What do I mean?  Look at this:

[Q2]
In their Quake II "overrated" section, they say:

"And despire what John Romero said about making the single-player game more 
compelling, the ending in Quake II is a joke."

Since when did John Romero do Quake II?  I don't think so, Gamecenter.

[Dolby]
In their Dolby Pro-Logic "overrated" section, they say:

"Though Pro Logic sounds slightly better in real life than simple stereo, 3D
positional audio simply needs more than two speakers."

Are they absolutely insane?  Dolby Pro-Logic utilizes 5 speakers (though the
two rears are the same channel, meaning 4 channels).  It is not a two-speaker
solution.  Virtual Dolby is, but I don't think it's even out and I don't think
there are any computer products that support it.  Gamecenter:  DOLBY PRO-LOGIC
IS A MULTI-SPEAKER SURROUND SYSTEM.  It uses *3 more* speakers than your 
statement suggests.  The fact of the matter is, most 3d positional solutions
(including the excellent new A3D Vortex) utilize 2 speakers... luckily, it
looks like they mix 4-channel Dolby Prologic through it, so if you've got the
right gear, you can hear full surround in games like Jedi Knight and Unreal.

True, Pro-Logic is basically 4 channels encoded into 2 channels.  But the effect
of it post-processing (where it's split back into 4 channels) and played through
5 speakers blows away any 3d positional 2-speaker solution.  Playing Unreal in
surround mode is phenomenally more satisfying.  I highly recommend it.

For those that didn't know or haven't checked yet, there is a News section on
our new webpage that I periodically (whenever there's Ritual news or 
information) update...  

I'm in the process of putting up some pictures of a party Harry Miller threw
last weekend, and some Ritual Campfire Tales (including the infamous Dick 
stories) are up there as well...

So, um, go check it out.  And keep coming back for more.  If you want the
inside scoop on Sin, FAKK2, Ritual, or anything else, it's the place to be. :)

-[ More E3 Impressions ]-

Totally forgot to mention Heretic II, stupid me, it certainly wasn't anything
to do with the quality...  Heretic II looked incredible, with some great 
effects, great art, etc etc.  The 3rd person view was cool, and best of all,
they let you play it!  :)  It hasn't even been in developement for that long,
yet it was playable (I should mention that Daikatana was totally playable
too...  only Half-Life wasn't, for whatever reason).  Had some cool acrobatics
and such you could do with the staff your character was carrying...  I can't
wait to play this one.


-[ Utah ISP ]-

Looks like US West has DSL in Provo, Utah, so that's probably what we'll go
with.  Anyone know if US West is a good provider?  How long does it take
them to hook the line up?  Are there any other, better solutions I should
know about?

Thanks for the responses, apreciate them.

Alright, so it's a bit late, but I didn't want to think about the show for 
awhile... sue me.  :)

Q2-based games:

Anyway, I was blown away by the Duke Nukem video -- awesome stuff, great 
explosions, a little over-the-top on the lens flares, but very action, very
cool.

Half-Life looked very cool with all their pre-scripted animations...  Watching
as the guy jumped on a table, breaking the table, and squishing the head-crap
rocked.  I was pretty bummed to find out it was only a looping non-interactive
demo though...  It's far enough along in developement that playability shouldn't
be an issue (like it is for Duke), but alas, no playable demo at E3.

Daikatana's levels and artwork looked incredible.  Kudos to the team for making
very realistic settings, especially DaBug and Sverre (I saw more of their 
levels than anyone else's and they looked killer).

Anachronox is looking great, both from an innovation and a technology
standpoint.  Corinne's done some great stuff to keep framerates up and make
the lighting look really good.  Don't know how much more of the cool stuff I
can reveal though.  :)

Others:

Populous III looks great.  I can't wait to get my hands on this, the first
one was (and still is) one of my all time favorite games.  Didn't like 2 much
at all, but 3 does look good.

Ultima Ascension looks promising.  Wish it was a party adventure, but I can
understand from a technical standpoint why that's not so good.  Can't wait to
see this even farther along.

Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Zelda64) looks *GREAT*.  I was totally drooling over it.
Truly cannot wait for this one.

Metal Gear Solid looks killer.  I wish this wasn't a PSX game (I hate the 
visual quality on PSX), but it is going to rule.  Played this for awhile, 
totally cool.  Metal Gear is probably my favorite NES game of all time.  

Best:

Lego-Robot-thingy.  This was the coolest show-floor exhibit I saw, it looked
totally awesome to be able to build and then program various machines and
whatnot out of legos.  I'm stoked about this one.  

Slave Zero from Accolade.  Totally, without a doubt, chock-full of potential. 
You're this huge (80-foot or so) robot (not a clunky MechWarrior robot, a lean
mean anime-style robot) in an enormous city... Cars whizzing by and all sorts
of stuff.  And the controls are action-based, like Quakes, rather than 
MechWarrior.  Engagements are fast and furious.  It's in a third-person 
perspective.  You can stomp on cars and crush them, leap up to other streets 
criss-crossing in the air, fall off buildings down to street level, etc etc.
Soooo cool I can't even describe it.  The potential is enormous. 

Disclaimer:  I worked on this project before joining Ritual, but it was going
in a totally different direction.  I'm still rather biased, of course.  :)


-[ ISP in Utah? ]-

A good friend of mine is moving out to Provo, Utah soon, and I need to find
a good internet provider, preferrably with flat-rate ISDN access, that has 
coverage out there.
