-[ The 'lord is laid low ]-

It's amazing how people can get crazy ideas into their heads... like our
very own levelord, thinking he's a demigod.  Needless to say, a Jedi Master
such as myself has a much better handle on things....  

Poor levelord found Norton's wonderful page (www.deathmatch.org) and woefully
commented in his plan file about how he really missed seeing a certain
HIPDM1 strategy page.  

Being so in-tune with the Force, I knew instantly that our levelord had 
missed a crucial link on Norton's front page... a link that lead straight 
to Norton's own HIPDM1 strategy guide, the very guide levelord had been
searching for.  

demigod indeed.  :)

-[ Computer Literacy mentioned in New York Times ]-

Shameless plug or something, but my parents own Computer Literacy Books+Online,
and they just got a quick blurb in the NY Times (this isn't the first, but
it's the most recent)...  

If you are interested in computer or technical books, this is the place to 
shop for them.  Fast, simple, easy, great selection and great service (yes,
I'm biased :)

-[ Quake2 Problem continued ]-

Wow!  I got literally flooded with responses...  Not too many were helpful,
but tons and tons of people seem to have these same problems. 

Now, a lot of people emailed me about m_filter in GLQuake (got lots of email
from people upset that m_filter doesn't seem to work in Quake2), which I was
aware of.  I had tried it in Quake2, and it didn't make a bit of difference.
However, I popped into GLQuake, turned m_filter on, and boom!  Almost like
glass.  Very nice..  

...However!  I just talked to Mark and Gary and they let me know that that 
is not a fix...  It simply lags the game for about a half-frame while the
game averages the last mouse input with the current mouse input.  Bleh.  I 
don't know about you, but lagging the game sucks.  

So, the quest goes on.  Gary and Mark have a few ideas, I'll be sure to keep
everyone posted...  but I'm glad to see that it's not just me being stupid...

-[ Sin on Linux?  BeOS? ]- 

I've had a lot of people ask me online about Linux Sin, and a handful ask me
about BeOS Sin...  I think it's pretty safe to say that we'd love to see Sin
on as many platforms as we can, especially one as wide-spread and stable as
Linux, however, we simply don't have the time to port Sin and maintain it on
a lot of different platforms.  

However, I seem to remember a certain CTF author stepping in and helping id
maintain their Unix ports in the not-so-distant past.  If there were interested
people who wanted to take the time to port and maintain for other platforms,
drop me a line.  Ideally, it would be someone who lives in or around Dallas,
I'm thinking, but who knows?

Now, I'm not promising that such a thing will occur, but we're certainly not
adverse to such a situation...  We want to get as much Sin out there as we can!

-[ More Quake2 problem ]-

Hmm, been going over different theories with Jack Mathews of 3Dfx and 
Gary McTaggart, UberProgrammer at Ritual, and I think we can safely rule out
Voodoo/Voodoo2 as the culprit.

It appears to be solely input related...  It exists in GLQuake and Quake2, 
though it is not as bad in GLQuake for some reason, probably because the input
stuff was done differently, I'm guessing.

NT Quake2 works fine, totally smooth.  Win95 seems to be h0rked though.  
Gary reports that using an Assasin3D rather than a mouse fixed the problem
in Win95 for awhile when he used one, and that NT works great.  (Which, indeed,
it does :)

I'm probably going to try nuking my Logitech drivers to see if they are the
problem, but knowing Microsoft, it's probably somethign inherent to Win95.

*sigh*

Anyway, if anyone else has any suggestions, comments, success stories, or 
whatnot, still drop me a line...  I'm very interested to figure out how
to resolve this in Win95.

-[ Weird Quake2 problem ]-

Have a strange Quake2 problem on my Voodoo2 card...  When I use my mouse
to spin around, it spins very smoothly, and very fast.  This is a Good 
Thing(tm).  However, as soon as I try to stafe and turn at the same time,
it starts to get jerky... Even though framerates may be as high as 70fps,
I'm still getting jerky turning...  It really *really* sucks.  

It's not a swapinterval problem or anything, I've played with all the known
variables both environmental and in the game.  I'm afraid it might be 
something terribly stupid, but I can't figure it out.

It's almost definitely something with the Voodoo2 card or something with 
my mouse drivers or something input related.  So of course, I fiddled with
my mouse drivers and all that, but to no avail.  

I'm stumped.

If anyone else has seen this or, better yet, knows the solution to my 
problem, please drop me a line.

Thanks!

-[ Tom's Birthday! ]-

Guess who's birthday it is today?  That's right, Paradox has aged one more 
year (ok, one more day, but it sure feels like a year, doesn't it Tom? :)

I'm sure he'd love some fan mail wishing him a wonderful day, so fire up
those email clients....  :)

-[ Format Change ]-

Thought I'd try a little bit of a format change that's easier to read in 
web browsers...  I'll still keep my lines to 80 chars or less for those of
you reading my plans in "real" finger clients...


-[ Finger Server Fixed ]-

Anyway, I think we've fixed the problem with our finger server...  Cross your
fingers...  



-----------------------
All kinda good stuff...

 o  First and foremost, DOOM fans should rejoice to hear that you can indeed
    purchase Hell To Pay and Perditions Gate, two 32-level DOOM add-ons done
    by some of the most talented gamers around.  Contributors include folks 
    responsible for levels in Master Levels and Final DOOM, and believe me,
    this stuff is top notch!

    Why now, you ask?  I know the add-ons were done and finished a couple years
    ago, but got snowballed or something over at WizardWorks or something... 
    I think it had something to do with GT's purchase of WizardWorks (at which
    time, amazingly enough, WizardWorks suddenly carried a whole bunch of
    junk titles...  GT trash, you might say).  I guess the add-ons just got
    buried in the mess.  :(

    Anyway, you can purchase them through WizardWork's online site now, and
    I can't even begin to tell you how cool they are.  Ultra-high quality DOOM
    stuff here... TOTAL Conversions, new weapons, new monsters, new levels, 
    everything.  All top-notch, done by people like Avatar, wendigo, and 
    Paradox.  For $30, it's a total steal for 64 new levels, new monsters
    and new weapons.  ($14.99 each)
 
    Oh, and no, I had nothing to do with it, so I'm not trying to line my own
    pockets.  I just like to see quality hard-work pay off for those who 
    put their blood, sweat and tears into products like these.

    If I had the time or energy, I'd love to promote these even more.  Anyone
    feel like whipping up some banners or something to help
