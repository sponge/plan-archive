-[ Sinday, Bloody Sinday IRC Party ]-

Sinday is 2 minutes away (in my time zone), the demo will be released later 
today (no, NOT in 2 minutes :), but there are ALREADY 300 people in #sin
hanging out having a party!

How cool is that?

Come join in the fun!   irc.3dnet.net   <---  server

-[ Planet Hollywood is a go! ]-

49 people have responded that they're coming, so I went over to Planet
Hollywood just now and got us a reservation for 55.   Should be fun.  :)

But that also means that people just deciding to come over to Planet 
Hollywood from CPL will need to wait for tables - and it's bound to be a long
wait.  Only those who emailed me in advance have reservations, so remember
that.

See ya'll there!  (Ack, now I'm talking like Charlie  )

-[ Lunch Thing ]-

Woo, looks like we'll have a good group going to Planet Hollywood (just got
3 of people emailing me in the last 45 minutes... what are you crazy people
doing up at 3:30 in the morning?!?!).

I'm going to be giving Planet Hollywood a specific number of people coming, 
so if you don't email me, you're going to have to fend for yourself and
wait a looooong time for a table and stuff...  

Just planning on tagging along is probably a Bad Thing(tm) is what I'm trying
to say.  :)

-[ Spontaneous CPL Lunch Thing ]-

Oh a whim, I've decided to see if I can create, totally last minute, a fun,
boisterous gathering of Quake fiends and fanatics for lunch this Friday
at Planet Hollywood.

For those who don't know, the event formerly-known-as-QuakeCon is happening
this weekend, and so lots of Quake fans will be in town.  

Planet Hollywood is about 2 miles (maybe less?) from the Infomart, near
Downtown Dallas.  It's a fun place, and some of you may remember the huge
gathering we managed at E3 last year in Atlanta.

Well, I want to do it again.  Almost-totally spontaneously, even.  I'm very
busy at work with the Sin demo, but I do have to eat and this may be my only
chance to really hang out with everyone from CPL.

So, noonish at Planet Hollywood (near McKinney and North Lamar, in the West
End Marketplace), be there.  I can't give rides or anything like that, so
if you want to come, you have to get there on your own.  

Oh yes, and if you're coming, email me and let me know how many people I
should make reservations for.  

Wonder if this'll even work?  Wonder if I can convince any other Ritual folks
to come?  Oh well, guess we'll find out.

-[ Sound Cards Part Two ]-

One on-the-ball reader of my .plan file sent in a link to an $89 Turtle 
Beach Montego A3D!!  That's a total steal, since it's already at least
as good (and I'm guessing better than) Creative Lab's new SoundBlaster
Live! card.   Thanks Brad!!

(It even says it has a "S/PDIF expander port" but that sounds like
I have to plug something in to get S/PDIF... I'll do a little more
digging.. S/PDIF stands for Sony/Phillips Digital InterFace, BTW.
It means I can run pure digital to my receiver.  Yummy.)

Update 6:49pm :  Just checked my Montego, there is indeed a "jack" for adding
on a S/PDIF card.  No idea how I get one, anyone from Turtle Beach reading
this?  I *really* want one of those.  It makes the card absolutely perfect.

Update (con't): Also, just discovered that the signal-to-noise ratio is 
better than 92dB (A weighted).  Yum.


I apologize in advance for the long URL, but I thought folks might be
interested...

$89 Montego A3D!

Also had some people ask me if the Diamond MonsterSound (and M80) cards 
are the same thing.  The answer is no.  Those boards are actually
DSPs running A3D 1.0.  The new cards actually have Aureal hardware,
capable of A3D 2.0 and lots more features in hardware.  They rule 
over anything I've heard announced from any other card-makers, and
they're available now.  There is a reason Dell and Compaq are
including them with lots of their new computers - they're cheap
and they rock.

For more information, you might want to check A3D's website... They're
very open with information about the cards, who's supporting them, and
developement info.

-[ Sound Cards ]-

I've seen some recent news posts on web pages about the new Creative Labs 
cards, and thought I'd share my 2 cents.  As most people who read this 
plan are no doubt aware, I'm very into audio quality, especially when it
comes to surround and multi-channel formats.

Having said that, I have to tout the ultimate in PC audio - the new Aureal A3D
Vortex chipset boards.  I have 3 of them for testing and profiling, and
I just love them.  Aureal has done an amazing job, and they remain at least
one step ahead of Creative.  

The Turtle Beach Montego is the most readily available A3D Vortex board, and
it lists for $129.  I'm fairly sure you could find it cheaper, perhaps even
at the $99 price point, but this is a total steal...  It's a PCI audio card
(can you say 2-3fps more in Quake/Quake2?  I thought you could) that maintains
compatibility with real-mode DOS apps (DOOM, baybee!!), it does 64-voice 
wavetable (and stores the samples in system RAM rather than expensive on-board
RAM), and it's crystal clear.  I'm not sure what their signal-to-noise ratio
is, but it certainly sounds better even than the AWE64 Gold.  

But the best part about it is the incredible 3D sound features.  Aureal's
positional audio is spectacular, and it's available right now.  

Jedi Knight and Unreal literally come alive with gunfire and sounds coming from
behind, caves in Unreal echoing eerily, and a myriad of other ultra-immersive
effects.  It's stunning what the difference sounds like.  And there are many
other games both available now and in the works that are equally stunning. 

I have to wonder why it's taken Creative so long to get with the program.  With
their Soundblaster line, they've led the PC audio pack for the last few years,
but they seem to have missed the boat with PCI audio cards and positional
audio.

Oh, yes, it's also awesome to see Aureal so eager and anxious to help 
developers get support in their games...  They remind me a lot of 3Dfx in that
regard.  We need more companies like this.

If only I could get my hands on a Vortex board with a S/PDIF output, I would
be one more step closer to aural heaven....
