-[ Sin Release on Day XX? ]-

The flood of rumors and whatnot has increased a ton in the last two days. I'm
getting flooded with ICQ and mail asking about Sin's release, so here's an
update.

Q:  Are we done yet?
A:  Nope, not quite yet.  We're in heavy bug-and-play testing.  

Q:  Are you going to be done soon?
A:  We certainly hope so.  It's getting close.

Q:  When's the release date?
A:  We don't have one.  "When it's done."

Q:  How about a good guess?
A:  Sorry, but software developement isn't an exact science.  We could be
    sure it was going to go gold in a matter of minutes, only to uncover a
    bug that puts us back another two days.  When we finish, you'll know.

Please don't email me or anyone else on the team asking about anything
covered here, we need all the time we can get just to finish up.  Lots of 
"When will it be done" email doesn't help, since we have no answer to give.

Sites like EBWorld and AVault have no idea what they're talking about with
their release dates, since we don't either.  :)

We really appreciate all of our fans and their growing excitement as we get
close.  You guys make it all worth it.


-[ SinEd and Sin tools ]-

The Node has the Sin editing tools up for public consumption.  Note that 
these versions of the tools are for editing and playing with the demo only.
The full version tools should be included on the full CD, and posted on our
website.

-[ Digitally Challenged ]-

My 3rd episode of "Digitally Challenged" is up, and it's sorta controversial.
Go read it and see what you think.

-[ Hockey ]-

It's the greatest game ever.  You know when players are paid to be on the
team simply to punch people, you have a good game.  But when the refs aren't
even allowed to break fights up until they're over, you know you have a great
game.  

Jim:  Probert ROCKS!!!


-[ ddt ]-

Sorry Dave, you got the 2nd to last good one.  


-[ Garbage Concert ]-

Part of the Ritual Tribe took a small break the other night to go party at
the Garbage concert here in Dallas.  Great fun was had by all, but alas, we
weren't able to find a Ritual fan who could get us backstage.  Awesome concert
though, Garbage ROCKS!!

-[ Elogica Sin server? ]-

We're trying to debug some problems people are seeing with the 2nd demo and
came across a server that seems to exhibit one of the particular problems...

Unfortunately, I have no idea who they are.  :)  They're in Brazil, and the
server name is "Elogica"...  If anyone has any leads as to how I can get
in contact with them and talk about what settings and stuff they're using,
I'd really appreciate it.
