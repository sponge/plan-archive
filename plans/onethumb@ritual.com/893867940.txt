one step further"...  here's the address, straight from Fox:

Fox Consumer Relations
PO Box 900
Beverly Hills, CA

Kudos go out to Geoff for the info.

-[ International No-DIVX Day is here! ]-

Welcome one and all to No DIVX Day.  For those of you who don't know, DIVX
is a competing format to Open DVD.  It uses a pay-per-view model (the disc
is encrypted and you must pay for every time you want to view the disc).  
I'm about to talk for a few paragraphs about why DIVX sucks hardcore, but for 
those of you who already know and want to do something about it, the most
important thing you could do right now is to write letters to the hold-out 
studios - Fox and Disney.



Here's how:

Mail Disney by going to:  http://www.disney.com/Mail/DisneyPictures/

Mail Disney

Mail Fox by emailng them at:  feedback@tcfhe.com

Mail Fox

Apparently they have shut down their laser@tcfhe.com address, but you may
want to try that.  In the event that they shut down feedback@tcfhe as well,
give these phone numbers a shot:

1-800-350-4FOX
(310) 369-3900
(310) 369-3319 (Fax)

Be sure to let them know that you're participating in International No-DIVX Day
and that you are only a small portion of a very concerned consumer based.  Be
polite, but forceful.  (Cussing them out will probably not get the desired 
effect  :)  Stress that you wish to view their incredible movies in an open
format that makes everyone comfortable - retailers, consumers, and studios 
alike.  



Now, on to why DIVX is so horrible...  First and foremost would be the price..
Let's face it, you can run down to Blockbuster and rent DVDs for $2-3.  And
if your local Blockbuster doesn't do this yet, they will.  They just announced
a national roll-out, so it's coming soon folks.  So, you can amble on into
your local Blockbuster and rent your favorite film for $2-3.  Cool, huh?  Yes
it is...  But DIVX and it's supporters want you to pay $5...  Yet they insist
that their format is a Good Thing(tm) and everyone will love it.  Yeah, right.

Bottom line:  DIVX discs will cost you more.  DIVX players will cost you more.
Are there ANY additional features that account for this cost?  Nope.  The
quality of the video is supposed to be identical.  However, DIVX will not
support additional languages, and additional movie-goodies that are very common
on DVD...  These include:  behind-the-scenes stills, director commentary, 
movie trailers, etc etc.  All the frills go bye-bye, and you still pay more.
How sad.

Now, this is very good for the studios... very good for Circuit City... but
very bad for retailers and consumers.  Consumers pay more, retailers are shut
out of the loop, and both lose.  Your local vidoe rental place is into 
renting you
