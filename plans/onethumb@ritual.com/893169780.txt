  o  Just say NO to DIVX!!  I'm stoked to see The Tech Zone stand up to 
     this corporate idiocy...  DIVX threatens to fracture the DVD market,
     destroy the image that's already been built, and cost consumers more
     money.  It totally sucks, and it's something that I'm very passionate
     about.  Thank goodness I'm not alone.  I gladly join my comrades at
     Voodoo Extreme,Redwood's, Blue's in my boycot of this terrible consumer
     rip-off strategy.

     Oh, and in case you're wondering, yes, Circuit City is behind this.  I've
     returned gear there and made sure the management knew why after learning
     of DIVX.  I hope it makes a difference.  I urge everyone else to do the
     same.

     Want to learn more?  There's a NO DIVX DAY scheduled for April 28th,
     the brainchild of the Tech Zone.  Here's the details:

  o  Hey, any CyberCafe/LAN game places looking for an area to open up in
     Dallas?  SlamSite or any others?  There's a totally prime location 
     down here in downtown... *Lots* of foot traffic, right near Planet 
     Hollywood, a sizable arcade, a movie theater, a mall, etc..  And there
     will be a big stadium being built not too far away in the near future,
     increasing traffic even more.  A prime location just went up for lease
     a few days ago, and I started thinking about how great it would be
     for a cybercafe/lan gaming location...  Drop me a line if you're 
     interested and want to know where it is...


  o  Had a great time yesterday hanging out in 3DNet's #sin chatting with
     a bunch of fans...  Spontaneously decided to give away a Sin t-shirt and
     one lucky soul managed to score himself a signed copy of Sin (when it's
     done of course)...  I have a hunch these won't be isolated events, so 
     if you dig Sin (and thus Sin stuff), you might want to poke your head
     in #sin once in awhile...

  o  I'm desperately looking for a MPEG encoder that can do 10fps.  I liked
     Xing, but it's lowest is 23fps and I want to do 10fps.

     Preferrably, I want an encoder that does video conversion (AVI, MOV, FLI,
     etc) and still sequential images (JPG, BMP, TGA, etc)... but any and
     all recommendations are appreciated.

     This can be Win95, NT, DOS, Linux, Be, or any other sane OS.  Software
     solutions only, unless you feel like shipping me a hardware board (I'd
     love you forever :)

     Thanks in advance!

  o  Ritual's new IRC server on 3DNet is now up and active.  We hang out on
     #sin periodically (more if our fans start hanging there!) to chat, answer
     questions, and ask for suggestions...  So cruise on over if you dig 
     talking with the folks behind the games...

     "Ritual.3dnet.net" is our server, and you can get on any of the others
     (including id's, Monolith's, Stomped's, and PlanetQuake's) by using 
     "irc.3dnet.net"

  o  Just finished a great new book by one of my favorite authors, Raymond E.
     Feist.  It's called Shards of a Broken Crown and is, of course, incredibly
     detailed and immersive.  He's created a wonderful world with a rich 
     history, deep characters, and I just love the entire series.  :)

  o  Anyone out there into DBS (DSS or DISH), D-VHS, and Dolby Digital gear?  I 
     just read about RCA's new Dolby Digital-capable DSS receiver, which was
     very exciting... but what I really want is a DBS receiver that either has
     a built-in D-VHS deck or a digital out (FireWire?) that a D-VHS deck 
     supports which also does Dolby Digital.  I know JVC has a combo 
     receiver/deck, and the deck portion is DD-capable... but does that mean
     that JVC's receiver is Dolby Digital-ready, just waiting for DISH to 
     start offering programming?  If so, they just got theirselves a customer,
     but I need to know for sure....

  o  Oh baby, Sin DM is fun.  :)  I've been seeing more Sin DM in the evenings
     here than DOOM, Quake, or Quake2...  that's always a good sign...  

     As Joe mentioned, the Sniper Rifle is just awesome.  People have already
     found all sorts of good places to snipe from...  as a result, everyone is
     getting used to throwing a few rockets towards those areas "just in case"

     Lots of hard work going on, Charlie and Tom are racking up the hours at
     the office at a phenomenal rate (Hence the stealthy  pictures on display 
     over at www.ritualistic.com...)  Everyone's been working hard and burning 
     the midnight oil and Sin's looking that much better as a result...

     (I'll certainly try to get more pictures of sleeping tribesmen for you
     all to enjoy... or laugh at, whichever you prefer :)
 
  o  My car got broken into last weekend.  I park in a garage in which is 
     housed not only a police sub-station, but also some FBI folks.  You'd 
     think I might be marginally safe....

     But no.  *sigh*  Luckily, they didn't get any of my stereo except my
     faceplate (oh, they tried... crowbar marks everywhere, bent dash, etc, 
     but a '67 Mustang isn't built like other cars, I guess :).  However,
     they did take my CD collection.  Yes, basically every CD I own is now
     in the hands of some loser thief.  100 CDs gone.  Bleh.  Sucks to be me.

     Added:  The CDs were in one of those soft cases so I could easily bring
             them to work, the car, or home...  very convienent for me and
             for the thief.  :(

     Does anyone out there know much about car stereos?  Can I get a 
     replacement faceplate?  or are they coded in such a way that I can't 
     get a new one that works with my deck?  Man, that would suck if so. 


  o  New bakery opened down the street.  Oh man, I love it.  It's a lot like
     all the bakeries you find in California, so it's like coming home again.
     Fresh bread of all kinds -  yummy!

 
  o  RBR apparently wants to actually follow through with their challenge...
     Poor guys have no idea the kind of beating they're in for... Alas, the
     Ritual team has been slaving away all weekend, so we may not be up to
     it this weekend (we need a break, I think!), but soon we'll administer 
     bead-downs in good measure....

  o  Ok, ok, so I did have time to pull an April Fool's day joke.  :)

     Well, actually, I should say we had time to pull an April Fool's day joke
     since everyone here at the office helped out and contributed... It was
     Tom's original idea for something else entirely, giggle
