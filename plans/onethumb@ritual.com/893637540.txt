BAM!  SMACK! POW!  A Redwood beatdown.

That's right, I smacked poor Red down today, reclaiming Ritual's rightful crown
to Sin...  The final score when I hopped out was 30 to 3.  Poor Red.  :)

He insists it was because he kept falling off and killing himself, but I just
say "That's part of the game, man."

Just hanging at the office right now, Redwood and I will probably go over to
id or do something fun today.... 

Hmm, maybe I should smack JoeSke around a bit more in Starcraft...  it's
very obvious that his Jedi training isn't coming along as fast as it should...

He needs to be punished.  Only through discipline can one attain true control
over the Dark Side of the Force.

Redwood's staying with me for the weekend and he got a big taste of Sin today
while he was hanging at the offices...

Little did we know that he's a closet Sin deathmatch champion...  On his first
game of Sin, he smacked Langsuyar, giggler, and myself down...  and we make
the freaking game!   :)

Anyway, we're heading out to eat some Thai and have some fun, so don't expect
any Redwood news updates until Monday or so.  :)
