-[ Sin Rockets ]-

Saw over on Ritualistic and Processed News that people have discovered some
cool stuff with our rockets  (yes, we knew about this, it's not a bug).

All I have to say is - keep digging, there are some other cool things (related)
that you can do, too.  :)

-[ Pre-Order Sin? ]-

I've gotten a lot of requests from people wanting to know where they can 
pre-order Sin...  So yesterday I asked people to find me the best prices for
buying Sin online, and I got a bunch of good ones.  I've posted both the lowest
priced (without shipping, non idea what their shipping costs are) and the lowest
that has FREE shipping... I have no idea how good either of these places are,
but I'm hoping they're reputable.  Here they are:

Sin for $34.90(US)!!  (Note that shipping is additional): 

http://www.buycomp.com:80/bc/noframes/product.asp?mscssid=9J41P0276HSH2MR800CLJA7DX9W2BPB8&sku=317022&ad=100001

$44.30 Sin! (with Free Shipping!)

-[ Pre-Order at Electronics Boutique ]-

If you pre-order your copy at EB, they're giving out cool Sin Mini-Strategy 
Guides (which can only be had through EB).  I'm not sure what EB's price is on
the game, but I'm sure it's competitive and you get the cool mini-guide along
with it.  

Hope that helps people know where to pre-order the game.  Please don't send mail
asking when it will be done - software developement isn't an exact science.

I've split up the Sin Demo into multiple parts for easy download.  In addition,
our FTP server supports resume - so if your FTP client does too (Like GetRight
and many others), I'm sure you'll find it's even easier to grab.

Thanks go out to the hundreds (!!) of people who emailed me file splitting
solutions.  You guys are the greatest!   (I ended up using WinRAR SFX, thanks
for the help and suggestions!)

-[ Cheapest Sin? ]-

I know a lot of online sites are selling Sin (no, it's not out yet, they're
just taking pre-orders... calm down  :)...  I'm wondering if anyone 
knows where the cheapest Sin can be pre-ordered?  Email me if you find some
great prices...

-[ Ritual's B-Day! ]-

Wow!  Ritual's been around for 2 years, today... and I've been privledged 
enough to be a part of it for a hair over a quarter of that...  And it's
been just barely 1.5 years since I met all the then-Hipsters at the HipHouse.
Whew!  Memories!

Thanks go out to everyone at Ritual for being such a talented team, and 
special thanks to those who helped me get to where I am today... You know
who you are!

Here's to many more years of Ritual coolness!!
