  o  Ritual's new IRC server on 3DNet is now up and active.  We hang out on
     #sin periodically (more if our fans start hanging there!) to chat, answer
     questions, and ask for suggestions...  So cruise on over if you dig 
     talking with the folks behind the games...

     "Ritual.3dnet.net" is our server, and you can get on any of the others
     (including id's, Monolith's, Stomped's, and PlanetQuake's) by using 
     "irc.3dnet.net"

  o  Just finished a great new book by one of my favorite authors, Raymond E.
     Feist.  It's called Shards of a Broken Crown and is, of course, incredibly
     detailed and immersive.  He's created a wonderful world with a rich 
     history, deep characters, and I just love the entire series.  :)

  o  Anyone out there into DBS (DSS or DISH), D-VHS, and Dolby Digital gear?  I 
     just read about RCA's new Dolby Digital-capable DSS receiver, which was
     very exciting... but what I really want is a DBS receiver that either has
     a built-in D-VHS deck or a digital out (FireWire?) that a D-VHS deck 
     supports which also does Dolby Digital.  I know JVC has a combo 
     receiver/deck, and the deck portion is DD-capable... but does that mean
     that JVC's receiver is Dolby Digital-ready, just waiting for DISH to 
     start offering programming?  If so, they just got theirselves a customer,
     but I need to know for sure....

  o  Oh baby, Sin DM is fun.  :)  I've been seeing more Sin DM in the evenings
     here than DOOM, Quake, or Quake2...  that's always a good sign...  

     As Joe mentioned, the Sniper Rifle is just awesome.  People have already
     found all sorts of good places to snipe from...  as a result, everyone is
     getting used to throwing a few rockets towards those areas "just in case"

     Lots of hard work going on, Charlie and Tom are racking up the hours at
     the office at a phenomenal rate (Hence the stealthy  pictures on display 
     over at www.ritualistic.com...)  Eve
