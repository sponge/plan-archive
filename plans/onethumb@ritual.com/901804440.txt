-[ Deathmatch Maxclients ]-

I've noticed a lot of servers are playing with maxclients set as high as 32.
This is probably a Bad Idea(tm).

SinCity is probably best with 2-8 people, and SinDM6 is probably best with 
4-16.  And 16 means a pretty full game on SinDM6.  

Overcrowded SinCity can be especially bad, since you can see the whole level
and drawing 32 players is just insane.  :)

Both levels rule, though, I just thought I'd give the server admins a few
pointers...

-[ More Rush Stuff ]-

Make sure you set your 3Dfx video renderer options to "Fullscreen: YES" on
the video options menu if you are trying to get Sin to work on Voodoo Rush.


-[ New READMEs ]-

Updated our README to include some more tips & tricks, information about 
dedicated servers, etc etc....

Readme


Also created a "Hardcorps Version" which is intended for "experts" in the
first-person shooter genre who just want to see what's new or different
with Sin, but don't want to deal with pages of installation and menu option
stuff they're already familiar with.

Are you Hardcorps?


-[ Common Problems Page ]-

I'm planning on putting up a webpage listing common problems and known bugs
soon.  Just hang tight, lots of stuff to do.  

Check Ritual's news page for more information as I get around to it.

-[ Sin Video Issues ]-

Some people have reported (most with Rush cards) that their screen just goes
grey and doesn't start the game...  Or that it gives them a glide error and
dumps them out...  Here's the solution:

Either run Sin from a command-line prompt, or edit the menu item in your 
Programs menu and use this command-line:

"sin +set vid_ref soft"

(without quotes) 

Sorry for the inconvenience, we didn't test on Rush, assuming that it was
going to function just like Voodoo/Voodoo2.  Other cards/setups may have
exhibited this problem as well.

You can then set up your settings properly using the Video config mode, and
the settings will be saved to your player profile for later use.

-[ Hardcorps Classified Update ]-

While writing and polishing the README that came long with the demo, I tried
to think of (with lots of excellent suggestions from the rest of the team) 
things that were new (looting the dead) or even more important (strafing, 
good aim) in Sin than other FPSes, and incorporate that into the Hardcorps:
Classified section of the README so that people would understand how the
new elements work.

Unfortunately, I totally spaced on 2 biggies, which I apologize for.  I'll
add some sections to the README tomorrow so that everyone can read them, 
but here they are in short-and-sweet format so you can get cracking on them
until I have time to write something a bit more clever:

Sniper Rifle 
To zoom in, simply hit "0" (or the key you've re-bound to be the sniper key)
again once the weapon is out.  To zoom out, hit it again.  Etc.


Weapons Getting Shot Out Of Hands 
You can shoot weapons out of people's hands, and they can shoot weapons
out of your hands.  Both in single player and in deathmatch.  I noticed that
Geoff Keighley mentioned this in his editorial.  You can simply pick up
your weapon again and begin using it...  What's cool about this is that
in deathmatch you have a fighting chance with the magnum against heavily-armed
opponents still... It's quite a rush to shoot a rocket launcher out of 
someone's hands and then use it to finish them off.  :)


I'll try to have something written up in the README later today, so hang
tight.  

Oh, and if you HAVEN'T yet read the Hardcorps: Classified section of the
README, I highly recommend it -- your Sin game and understanding of the
features will drastically improve.

-[ Remembering Sin ]-

Man, I still remember when Tom Mustaine (Paradox) took me and a handful of 
other fanatics over to the Ritual offices last year and showed us the
preliminary helicopter stuff - complete with a scripted brush helicopter
he had made!

Awesome to see those things mature and come to fruition, even when no-one 
else has done them before.



-[ Response ]-

The response has been wonderful from all of you, we're all pumped up to finish
the final version of the game.  You guys all rule!  Thanks for all the
constructive feedback about bugs and gameplay issues...  

Please don't be upset if I can't respond to everyone who emails me, I've gotten
hundreds and hundreds today alone.  I read them all - but we do have a game
to complete.  :)

-[ Sin Demo is OUT! ]-

We had a fiasco with our FTP server for awhile -- too many rabid fans kept
hitting it!  I think it's under control now, and lightning fast.

If you want the demo, or to read the README (which contains lots of tips,
tricks, and goodies as well as technical information and whatnot), head
on over to the Ritual Outpost.

Ritual Outpost


Thanks go out to everyone who was very supportive and turned out in huge
numbers on IRC to cheer us on.  That was incredibly cool.

-[ IRC Impersonators ]-

I hate them.  Especially when they then don't believe that I'm the real
deal.  (Hi Phelon!)

-[ Sin IRC Party! ]-

Wow!  500 people and growing FAST!

Scourge Done Slick almost rivals Star Wars.

-[ Planet Hollywood is a go! ]-

49 people have responded that they're coming, so I went over to Planet
Hollywood just now and got us a reservation for 55.   Should be fun.  :)

But that also means that people just deciding to come over to Planet 
Hollywood from CPL will need to wait for tables - and it's bound to be a long
wait.  Only those who emailed me in advance have reservations, so remember
that.

See ya'll there!  (Ack, now I'm talking like Charlie  )

-[ Lunch Thing ]-

Woo, looks like we'll have a good group going to Planet Hollywood (just got
3 of people emailing me in the last 45 minutes... what are you crazy people
doing up at 3:30 in the morning?!?!).

I'm going to be giving Planet Hollywood a specific number of people coming, 
so if you don't email me, you're going to have to fend for yourself and
wait a looooong time for a table and stuff...  

Just planning on tagging along is probably a Bad Thing(tm) is what I'm trying
to say.  :)

-[ Spontaneous CPL Lunch Thing ]-

Oh a whim, I've decided to see if I can create, totally last minute, a fun,
boisterous gathering of Quake fiends and fanatics for lunch this Friday
at Planet Hollywood.

For those who don't know, the event formerly-known-as-QuakeCon is happening
this weekend, and so lots of Quake fans will be in town.  

Planet Hollywood is about 2 miles (maybe less?) from the Infomart, near
Downtown Dallas.  It's a fun place, and some of you may remember the huge
gathering we managed at E3 last year in Atlanta.

Well, I want to do it again.  Almost-totally spontaneously, even.  I'm very
busy at work with the Sin demo, but I do have to eat and this may be my only
chance to really hang out with everyone from CPL.

So, noonish at Planet Hollywood (near McKinney and North Lamar, in the West
End Marketplace), be there.  I can't give rides or anything like that, so
if you want to come, you have to get there on your own.  

Oh yes, and if you're coming, email me and let me know how many people I
should make reservations for.  

Wonder if this'll even work?  Wonder if I can convince any other Ritual folks
to come?  Oh well, guess we'll find out.
