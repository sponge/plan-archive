-[ Outlook experts? ]-

Any Outlook '98 experts out there?  I have a couple thousand messages I want
to filter through (bug reports :)...  I want to seperate them into seperate
folders based on what type of bug they are, fairly simple, but I can't seem
to find a way to make Outlook apply filters to existing mail, only incoming 
messages...  Is this possible?  And if so, how?


-[ Exchange experts? ]-

Any MS Exchange 5.5 experts out there?   I want to set up an auto-responder
on our info@ritual.com email to explain the current status of the demo,
of the full game, etc etc.  However, there doesn't seem to be an easy, simple
option to do that.  :(

This is probably a Bad Idea(tm).

SinCity is probably best with 2-8 people, and SinDM6 is probably best with 
4-16.  And 16 means a pretty full game on SinDM6.
