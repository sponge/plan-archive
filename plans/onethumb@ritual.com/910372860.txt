-[ Make Money While Sinning! ]-

Wanna make $500 just for being a killer Sin player?  I'm going to be running
a quicky little 64 (or thereabouts) Sin tournament this weekend in Fort Worth,
Texas.  The winner takes home $500, I've been told.

We'll be playing the full version, they'll be 4 player free-for-alls until
the last two or so matches (this is very laid-back, not heavy competition
at all, so we'll work out the details as we go), when we'll go for just
one-on-one.  

Not sure who else from Ritual will be there, but I love to talk with and
hang out with our fans (I'm still a fan, really, myself), so come on by.

-[ Other Sin Issues ]-

Please please please make sure you're running Sin from the Start Menu rather
than from the auto-loader when you put the CD in the drive.  I'm not sure why,
but starting it from the CD totally breaks a lot of things, including saving
games and apparently introduces major speed and loading time issues.  Bleh.

- Updated:  12:14pm

I've verified that using the auto-loader plays the game ENTIRELY off the CD.
This is a Bad Thing(tm).  It results in VERY slow performance, and no saved
games, among other things.  I'm amazed that it actually works.  

Unfortunately, since this is hard-burned on the CD, there's nothing we can
do to change it.  Activision reports that they have fixed the problem and
future CDs won't have this problem.


PLEASE READ:

Note that the game itself isn't broken --  Just make sure you're playing it
off your hard-drive rather than the CD.  Everything should get drastically
faster and better.  :)

-[ Sin Sound Issues ]-

I'm getting reports that Sin runs great on everyone's machine EXCEPT for 
people with SoundBlaster PCI cards (PCI64, PCI128, and Live!).  

It turns out that the culprit is the EAX drivers for the PCI cards, and 
installing non-EAX drivers or toggling EAX off in the control panel should
fix the problem.

Note that you may also have to change the 3D Sound option (which is meant
for Aureal A3D cards) to off in Sin as well.

More information can be found at our website, www.ritual.com, and I'll 
update there if I find any more definitive answers.

Also, if anyone has successfully fiddled with their drivers and Sin and gotten
them to work properly, I'd appreciate an email that details exactly what
changes and settings you used.  I hate to hear about people not able to
play the game.

-[ Gold is Good ]-

That's right folks, we're Gold.  It should start showing up on store shelves
soon.  It's been an awesome ride working with the Tribe here at Ritual.  We
had a wonderful time making the game, hopefully you guys (and gals!) will 
enjoy playing it just as much.


-[ Wieder Rolls on Outta Here ]-

If you hadn't heard, Charlie Wiederhold is no longer with Ritual.  He stuck
it out to the very end of Sin and then headed off to join the Duke team over 
at 3DRealms.

I'm sure I speak for the rest of the team when I say that it was a pleasure 
to work with Charlie...  He's certainly one of the nicest people I've ever
met, let alone worked with.  And in a few days, you'll all get to see just
how talented he is -- he did some phenomenal things in Sin.

Before all the rumor pages go bonkers, Charlie left on wonderful terms.  He
finished the project with the rest of us, and then headed off to work on 
another one he's very excited about. 

Good luck Charlie, can't wait to see what you do with Duke!
