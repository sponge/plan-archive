-[ File Splitter Util? ]-

I've been looking for a way to simply and easily provide the ability for our
fans to download our demo in easy-to-swallow bite-sized chunks rather than
this large 34meg file...  

However, it seems that no good util exist, or I'm just stupid.  :)

I could use RAR, but many people don't have it.  I'd love to create a SFX
multi-part archive, but I'm not seeing any way to do that, either... 

Even just .ZIP would be awesome, but I don't want to have it split only at 
1.44meg boundaries (I can't seem to find a way to specifiy an archive size).

Does anyone know of any utilities that do either of these?

Thanks much!
