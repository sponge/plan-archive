Now JoeSke's Jedi training begins in earnest.  After his 20-to-6 loss last 
night to my mighty Jedi skills (on a Sin DM map with no health even!), his
ego has been laid low.  Now is the time for rebuilding...

Greets go out to Jack Mathews... not sure if I have three plan updates in
me today, but I'll give it my best shot...  :)

My Jedi Mastery is complete, but alas, Jedi-in-training JoeSke is failing his
tests, one-by-one.  With his defeat in Starcraft, and now Tic-Tac-Toe, his
defeat is nearly complete.  Tonight the final test begins - that of Sin.

Occasionally it is necessary to complete break the will of Jedi-trainees.  It
appears that JoeSke is just such a case.  Only be realizing how weak his skills
really are can he truly have the burning desire to learn and improve.  

I can only hope this is the case.

-[ Redwood loses his crown ]-

BAM!  SMACK! POW!  A Redwood beatdown.

That's right, I smacked poor Red down today, reclaiming Ritual's rightful crown
to Sin...  The final score when I hopped out was 30 to 3.  Poor Red.  :)

He insists it was because he kept falling off and killing himself, but I just
say "That's part of the game, man."  



his puny Terran encampment (I cannot call it a base with a clear conscience)
and went on to win the day....

Maybe he'll come crawling back when his bruises and welts have healed a bit...
