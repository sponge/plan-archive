-[ Sin Scripting Demo ]-

Well, we sorta stepped out on a limb with this Sin Scripting Demo we released,
we certainly hope you all dug it.  But I'm curious how everyone felt about
it -- was it a good thing?  Is it valuable for those of you waiting to create
Sin stuff?  Does it adequately start to show you all how to create stuff?
Does it help for companies like Ritual to release this sort of stuff in
advance?  I certainly hope so, but I'd really love to hear what everyone
thought of it.  Most game companies seem to release lots of action-packed
movies and whatnot (and we're no exception), but I think it's important that
we try to help those of you who extend the lifetime of these games as well, and
truly make cool magic happen.  

Also, I'm wondering what everyone thought of the multiple format video release.
I know in the past, I've been pissed when I couldn't download a better version
of a video (say, when I'm on a T1) or a smaller version (when I'm on a 
modem) and always wished someone would give me a choice.  Well, I figured
I'd give it a shot and give you all a choice this time.  If you liked it,
we'll see about doing it in the future as well.  Just let me know.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, check out the Ritual Outpost

-[ SinEd ]-

Along with this scripting release, I suppose it's appropriate to remind 
everyone that SinEd will be included, free of charge, on the Sin CD.  Since
the scripting language is in text format, and you'll be equipped with the
editor right out of the box, there shouldn't be anything stopping mod makers
from creating amazing environments to show off.


-[ AMD K6-2 3DNow! ]-

I've gotten some email wondering what's up with Sin and AMD's 3DNow! stuff.
I can tell you that we have a couple of boxes here, and we're actively working
with AMD on including support.  No promises of course, but it's looking good.
