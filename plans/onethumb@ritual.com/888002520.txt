All kinda good stuff...
-----------------------

 o  First and foremost, DOOM fans should rejoice to hear that you can indeed
    purchase Hell To Pay and Perditions Gate, two 32-level DOOM add-ons done
    by some of the most talented gamers around.  Contributors include folks 
    responsible for levels in Master Levels and Final DOOM, and believe me,
    this stuff is top notch!

    Why now, you ask?  I know the add-ons were done and finished a couple years
    ago, but got snowballed or something over at WizardWorks or something... 
    I think it had something to do with GT's purchase of WizardWorks (at which
    time, amazingly enough, WizardWorks suddenly carried a whole bunch of
    junk titles...  GT trash, you might say).  I guess the add-ons just got
    buried in the mess.  :(

    Anyway, you can purchase them through WizardWork's online site now, and
    I can't even begin to tell you how cool they are.  Ultra-high quality DOOM
    stuff here... TOTAL Conversions, new weapons, new monsters, new levels, 
    everything.  All top-notch, done by people like Avatar, wendigo, and 
    Paradox.  For $30, it's a total steal for 64 new levels, new monsters
    and new weapons.  ($14.99 each)
 
    Oh, and no, I had nothing to do with it, so I'm not trying to line my own
    pockets.  I just like to see quality hard-work pay off for those who 
    put their blood, sweat and tears into products like these.

    If I had the time or energy, I'd love to promote these even more.  Anyone
    feel like whipping up some banners or something to help this cause?  

 o  Secondly, Happy Birthday to Zoid!  As I found out yesterday, Zoid is even
    cooler than I thought he was... he shares my birthday!  (So this is a little
    late, but since there wasn't much mention of it on the net yesterday, 
    I thought I'd throw a little limelight his way... as if he's not getting
    enough from his stellar Q2 CTF pack).  How cool is it to release a
    professional, polished id product on your birthday? That takes the cake.

 o  Lastly, but perhaps most important, WHAT THE HECK IS UP WITH GAMESLICE?!?

    For those of you just joining us, GameSlice put up a lengthy 8 page preveiw
    of Sin.  Very exciting, full of details and exclusive screenshots and AVIs.
    There are a few things here and there sorta out of whack, but in all, it's
    a pretty good piece.

    Then, yesterday, they threw up an editorial apparently bent on slamming
    Ritual for not showing enough, perhaps because we didn't send them a demo.
    Here is the quoted text (without permission):

                    If you've read our recent Sin feature, you
                    know the game is still scheduled for the
                    Spring, but I sure can't see it arriving
                    anytime soon.  As many of you have
                    commented in response to our article, it's
                    rather strange Ritual isn't talking about
                    specific elements of the game (including
                    weapons or levels) just a few months
                    before release.  Although secrecy may be
                    part of the reason for this holdback, we
                    agree that it doesn't seem to fit that Sin is
                    being kept so quiet.  I wouldn't be surprised
                    to see this game slip into the fall,
                    considering the fact Ritual wasn't even able
                    to show us the game for our feature.

    Now, perhaps GameSlice is a little miffed that we didn't actually send
    them a physical copy of the game...  However, I think there are a few
    things they (and everyone else) should bear in mind:

    1.  This is the team that had a demo ready for E3 mere weeks after 
	beginning the project.  This was a hands-on demo complete with colored
	lighting, two maps that drew repeated oohs and aahhs, and even a pair
	of functional, fun weapons.  If, in just a few short weeks, they could
	prepare something like that, don't you think it's possible that they
	might be able to get a game shipped somewhere close to it's intended
	release date?

    2.  Quake II just barely shipped.  Which means, we just barely got our
	code drop.  Which means things are in a state of flux as we transition
	over.  We have the whole kit and kaboodle working on id's original
        Quake engine along with our pile of mods, but everything hasn't been
        transitioned over yet to the new codebase.

    3.  Ritual has been saying "Spring of 1998" since the inception of the
        project.  Half-Life, on the other hand, was stating November of 1997,
        and Unreal was slated to arrive before Quake (then a few moths after
	Quake, then before Quake II, etc).  Now I'm not slamming either game,
	they both look excellent and I am a gamer above all else.  And I would
	sincerely wish a developer like Epic would work on the product and get
	it right rather than shipping it in an early state.  That is a Good
	Thing(tm), but my point is that so far, Ritual hasn't wavered on 
	their release date.  And we don't intend to.

    4.  We want Sin to really grab our player's imaginations and to be truly
	immersive and intriguing.  I believe (as does the rest of the company,
	I think) that giving away too much information about the product 
	detracts from this.  First of all, what would happen if we announced
	that we were going to have a anti-gravity weapon in Sin, and then later
	removed it?  Some of our fans would feel let down.  Secondly, the 
	feeling of awe as you walk into some new environment you had no idea
	was even possible is priceless -- and we want to give our players that
	type of experience.  Spoiling it by telling everyone about all of our
	levels is just suicidal, I think.  The same thing goes for the weapons.
	When you play Sin and pick up various weapons, I want the player's mind
	to be clean and open to the impact of those particular weapons. 

    5.  "wasn't even able to show us the game for our feature" is a little
	harsh, don't you think?  While we are in the middle of merging the
	new code drop from id, that doesn't mean we aren't able to show 
	the game running.  People who have visited various conventions 
	including QuakeCon '97 and the Frag have seen Sin in action.
	They have seen levels with vastly different artwork and architecture. 
	They've seen cool goodies like hopping into a vehicle and running
	people over.  They've seen various weapons.  They've seen portions of
	the world be destroyed.  In short, they've seen Sin running.  And
	that was months ago.  Even then, the overwhelming response was 
	excitement.  So to imply that we're so far away as to be un-demoable
	is ludicrous.  A far better reason is that we just don't want any
	outside copies of Sin.  While I'd never accuse GameSlice of leaking 
	copies of games, it's fairly common for a leaked copy of an unreleased
	game to originate from the press.  The policy here at Ritual has
	always been "nothing leaves the office."  This is nothing new.

So, while Sin will ship "when it's done," as always, don't be too surprised
when you see it on store shelves months before the leaves are turning yellow 
and orange.  :)

Me and the new Job
------------------

Well, here I am.  I still can't believe I'm working for one of the  hottest
game companies around.  It's almost like a dream....

About 3 weeks ago, I hopped in my blue 1967 Mustang and drove nearly 2000 
miles, leaving behind sunny beaches for the dubious weather in Dallas Texas.
Although, come to think of it, I hear California is getting rained out the
last few weeks... so I guess I'm better off.  :)

Anyway, a lot of people have asked me what it's like working for Ritual...
I have to tell you, it's incredible.  The amount of creativity here is
staggering.  It's no wonder Sin is getting all sorts of great press... it's
because everyone here is putting their heart and soul into it -- and it shows.

Better still, the creative gods here are very open-minded.  They actually
listen to me, the newbie, and what I have to say regarding everything from
gameplay to UI.  It's wonderful, I already feel like I'm a part of this living
breathing machine.

Actually, I guess it's more like a tribe... the whole tribal theme has been
sprouting up among our press releases, but that's really what it's like over
here...  We all get together around a virtual campfire (amber glow of a 
21" monitor, perhaps?) and start talking, arguing, and chatting.  Eventually
our tribal leader, Joe, writes everything down in his pile of skins, and we
move on.  Very open, and everyone is given a chance to speak up.  I'm having
a blast, since I love to talk about anything gaming related.  As of yet, no
spears or coconuts have been thrown at my head, either  :)


-----------------
The new bungaloes
-----------------

I expect the digital camera back from Kodak in a number of days, but I thought
I'd briefly explain our new offices and then go into greater detail with 
pictures later...

We have a long hallway that runs the length of our new space, but it's not
straight, but rather at an angle so that all the rooms are not just normal
square boring rooms.  Very subtle, but cool nonetheless.

Also, we have these cool fader lights that look almost like point lights in 
Quake... they're trippy to play with and watch the shadows change when you're 
walking through them and stuff... ok, so maybe
