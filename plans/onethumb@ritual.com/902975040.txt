I've split up the Sin Demo into multiple parts for easy download.  In addition,
our FTP server supports resume - so if your FTP client does too (Like GetRight
and many others), I'm sure you'll find it's even easier to grab.

Thanks go out to the hundreds (!!) of people who emailed me file splitting
solutions.  You guys are the greatest!   (I ended up using WinRAR SFX, thanks
for the help and suggestions!)

-[ Cheapest Sin? ]-

I know a lot of online sites are selling Sin (no, it's not out yet, they're
just taking pre-orders... calm down  :)...  I'm wondering if anyone 
knows where the cheapest Sin can be pre-ordered?  Email me if you find some
great prices...

Wow!  Ritual's been around for 2 years, today... and I've been privledged 
enough to be a part of it for a hair over a quarter of that...  And it's
been just barely 1.5 years since I met all the then-Hipsters at the HipHouse.
Whew!  Memories!

Thanks go out to everyone at Ritual for being such a talented team, and 
special thanks to those who helped me get to where I am today... You know
who you are!

Here's to many more years of Ritual coolness!!
