-[ More Quake2 problem ]-

Hmm, been going over different theories with Jack Mathews of 3Dfx and 
Gary McTaggart, UberProgrammer at Ritual, and I think we can safely rule out
Voodoo/Voodoo2 as the culprit.

It appears to be solely input related...  It exists in GLQuake and Quake2, 
though it is not as bad in GLQuake for some reason, probably because the input
stuff was done differently, I'm guessing.

NT Quake2 works fine, totally smooth.  Win95 seems to be h0rked though.  
Gary reports that using an Assasin3D rather than a mouse fixed the problem
in Win95 for awhile when he used one, and that NT works great.  (Which, indeed,
it does :)

I'm probably going to try nuking my Logitech drivers to see if they are the
problem, but knowing Microsoft, it's probably somethign inherent to Win95.

*sigh*

Anyway, if anyone else has any suggestions, comments, success stories, or 
whatnot, still drop me a line...  I'm very interested to figure out how
to resolve this in Win95.

-[ Weird Quake2 problem ]-

Have a strange Quake2 problem on my Voodoo2 card...  When I use my mouse
to spin around, it spins very smoothly, and very fast.  This is a Good 
Thing(tm).  However, as soon as I try to stafe and turn at the same time,
it starts to get jerky... Even though framerates may be as high as 70fps,
I'm still getting jerky turning...  It really *really* sucks.  

It's not a swapinterval problem or anything, I've played with all the known
variables both environmental and in the game.  I'm afraid it might be 
something terribly stupid, but I can't figure it out.

It's almost definitely something with the Voodoo2 card or something with 
my mouse drivers or something input related.  So of course, I fiddled with
my mouse drivers and all that, but to no avail.  

I'm stumped.

If anyone else has seen this or, better yet, knows the solution to my 
problem, please drop me a line.

Thanks!

-[ Tom's Birthday! ]-

Guess who's birthday it is today?  That's right, Paradox has aged one more 
year (ok, one more day, but it sure feels like a year, doesn't it Tom? :)

I'm sure he'd love some fan mail wishing him a wonderful day, so fire up
those email clients....  :)

-[ Format Change ]-

Thought I'd try a little bit of a format change that's easier to read in 
web browsers...  I'll still keep my lines to 80 chars or less for those of
you reading my plans in "real" finger clients...


-[ Finger Server Fixed ]-

Anyway, I think we've fixed the problem with our finger server...  Cross your
fingers...

  o  Just say NO to DIVX!!  I'm stoked to see The Tech Zone stand up to 
     this corporate idiocy...  DIVX threatens to fracture the DVD market,
     destroy the image that's already been built, and cost consumers more
     money.  It totally sucks, and it's something that I'm very passionate
     about.  Thank goodness I'm not alone.  I gladly join my comrades at
     Voodoo Extreme,Redwood's, Blue's in my boycot of this terrible consumer
     rip-off strategy.

     Oh, and in case you're wondering, yes, Circuit City is behind this.  I've
     returned gear there and made sure the management knew why after learning
     of DIVX.  I hope it makes a difference.  I urge everyone else to do the
     same.

     Want to learn more?  There's a NO DIVX DAY scheduled for April 29th,
     the brainchild of the Tech Zone.  Here's the details:

  o  Hey, any CyberCafe/LAN game places looking for an area to open up in
     Dallas?  SlamSite or any others?  There's a totally prime location 
     down here in downtown... *Lots* of foot traffic, right near Planet 
     Hollywood, a sizable arcade, a movie theater, a mall, etc..  And there
     will be a big stadium being built not too far away in the near future,
     increasing traffic even more.  A prime location just went up for lease
     a few days ago, and I started thinking about how great it would be
     for a cybercafe/lan gaming location...  Drop me a line if you're 
     interested and want to know where it is...


  o  Had a great time yesterday hanging out in 3DNet's #sin chatting with
     a bunch of fans...  Spontaneously decided to give away a Sin t-shirt and
     one lucky soul managed to score himself a signed copy of Sin (when it's
     done of course)...  I have a hunch these won't be isolated events, so 
     if you dig Sin (and thus Sin stuff), you might want to poke your head
     in #sin once in awhile...

  o  I'm desperately looking for a MPEG encoder that can do 10fps.  I liked
     Xing, but it's lowest is 23fps and I want to do 10fps.

     Preferrably, I want an encoder that does video conversion (AVI, MOV, FLI,
     etc) and still sequential images (JPG, BMP, TGA, etc)... but any and
     all recommendations are appreciated.

     This can be Win95, NT, DOS, Linux, Be, or any other sane OS.  Software
     solutions only, unless you feel like shipping me a hardware board (I'd
     love you forever :)

     Thanks in advance!

  o  Ritual's new IRC server on 3DNet is now up and active.  We hang out on
     #sin periodically (more if our fans start hanging there!) to chat, answer
     questions, and ask for suggestions...  So cruise on over if you dig 
     talking with the folks behind the games...

     "Ritual.3dnet.net" is our server, and you can get on any of the others
     (including id's, Monolith's, Stomped's, and PlanetQuake's) by using 
     "irc.3dnet.net"

  o  Just finished a great new book by one of my favorite authors, Raymond E.
     Feist.  It's called Shards of a Broken Crown and is, of course, incredibly
     detailed and immersive.  He's created a wonderful world with a rich 
     history, deep characters, and I just love the entire series.  :)

  o  Anyone out there into DBS (DSS or DISH), D-VHS, and Dolby Digital gear?  I 
     just read about RCA's new Dolby Digital-capable DSS receiver, which was
     very exciting... but what I really want is a DBS receiver that either has
     a built-in D-VHS deck or a digital out (FireWire?) that a D-VHS deck 
     supports which also does Dolby Digital.  I know JVC has a combo 
     receiver/deck, and the deck portion is DD-capable... but does that mean
     that JVC's receiver is Dolby Digital-ready, just waiting for DISH to 
     start offering programming?  If so, they just got theirselves a customer,
     but I need to know for sure....
