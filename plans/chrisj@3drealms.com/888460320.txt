This is my plan and my plan alone.  Basically just my thoughts, rants, opinions, life, and sometime there's even actual information!  
Stay tuned dear viewer...

If infinite rednecks fired infinite shotguns at an infinite number of road signs, they'd eventually create all the great literary works of the world in braille.

Wow... 8 minutes past midnight.  Delerium is setting in and I think I can see through time.  I must do this more often.

First and foremost:  Congratulations to Doug Wolf.  He's leaving ION Storm for much MUCH greener pastures in California at Digital Domain.  One of those things that really says "You've arrived."  It was definitely an honor to have worked with you at ION Doug.  I look forward to seeing your work on the 'other' screens now. :)  Just kinda cool to think I'm gonna see a guy's name ion the credits for feature films sometime and actually be able to say I know the guy and talk to him alot.  (Remember:  you DID say you'd keep in touch :)

Here's an interesting tidbit of info:
>> Subject: Back to the Future II: Spooky
>If you remember the movie "Back to the Future II" you will recall that
>Biff goes to the future and steals a Sports Almanac, where in turn he goes
>back to the past to give it to young Biff.  As we all know Young Biff was
>able to become very wealthy by betting on games where he already knew the
>final score.
>
>In an obscure line you hear young Biff say "Florida is going to win the
>World Series in 1997, yeah right."
>
>This movie came out in 1987, ten years before the Marlins did actually
>win the world series.  And what's really weird is ... Florida didn't
>even have a baseball team in 1987.  The Marlins are only 5 years old.
Spooky, huh?

Sorry, had to get that outta my system.  Next time should be something tangible and not tinged with delirium.

This way to the egress.
