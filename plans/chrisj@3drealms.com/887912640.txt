This is my plan and my plan alone.  Basically just my thoughts, rants, opinions, life, and sometime there's even actual information!  
Stay tuned dear viewer...

Ah... gloomy days.  Coupled with the fact that I've listened to the entirety of The Wall yesterday and today while getting into the groove should make all my models and animations particularly depressed.  I think one of them actually committed suicide in the middle of "Goodbye Blue Sky", but I might be mistaken... :)

So down to business, then.  Things are simply rolling along pretty well, couple of things have come up and been taken care of.  Let's just say that after talking at length with Kiwi (and Nick too, when he's coherent *grin*), and bouncing ideas back and forth off of each other, I have a greater respect for what these code monkeys do all the time. :)  Couple of tricks seem to be coming out of all of this on both sides.  You're gonna get a kick out of it I think.

Mike and I have been plugging away at animations and such, again bouncing ideas off of each other.  As a result, I find myself having (or just wanting mostly) to change and or redo a couple of things, but for the better, so I can live with it, at least until my seven-day waiting period is up. :)  

Brian, who I occasionally have to smack around with the baseball bat of reality, has been just tearing it up with the weapons models and anims.  Once you pound it into his head that a rock isn't necessarily the type of weapon we're looking for, he's good to go. :)  Seriously, he's taken some of these weapons and done some stuff to them that is actually different than I had envisioned them by simply looking at the model.  Tres Cool.


Finally, another conversation, this one with my father last weekend. (Yes I'm 25, and I still speak to my folks, it ain't a crime!)

DAD:  I hate when people talk about winning the lottery and it not changing them much.  If I won the lottery, I'd become the most annoying son-of-a-bitch you've ever seen.

ME:  So you're saying it wouldn't change you much, then?

DAD:  I guess so.

What can I say?  I come from excellent genetic stock. :)

Hmmm. Enough for now.

"Yea verily... and the artist doth come in early to worketh on his animationseths... and it is good..."

Been bopping around for a little while tweaking some on the model/anims I've been working on.  Figure when these are done it'll be almost and about done.  Couple of geometry changes that I hadn't noticed but some other quick-eyed people (i.e. who hadn't been satring at it constantly for a while) noticed.  So that looks good to go.

It never ceases to amaze me how the very small changes can help change something so drastically, and ultimately for the better.

Checked out the Mysteries of the Sith demo.  Very cool.  Pretty fun... methinks the AI needs to be tweaked a tad though... nothing worse than leaping into a fray between incoming heathen Stormtroopers and your own rebel forces (yes, they fight alongside you... tres cool) and finding yourself wailing like a banshee, dying because one of your comrades decided shooting you was an acceptable way to get to them.  Friendly fire isn't. 

Music I'm listening to:  Whatever Brian's been playing.

Music Brian's playing:  my CDs... (um... does anyone else find this odd?)

See you on the Dark Side
