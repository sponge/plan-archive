This is my plan and my plan alone.  Basically just my thoughts, rants, opinions, life, and sometime there's even actual information!

Oh Christ.  Heard and started thinking about Kiwi's driver's license problems, and started thinking about it, and well crap, I might have a problem during E3 as well.  You see my 26th birthday is on the 27th, meaning that my license expires while I am in Atlanta.  Just freaking wonderful.  Man I really hope they don't give me any grief over it, because I haven't had a good let-you-hair-down-or-shave-it-all-off time in a LOOONG time, and I really planeed on attempting to catch up whilst in Atlanta.  Don't make me angry... you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.   (So if you're there, bring me presents to help appease me. ;)

Went and saw that Godzilla flick today, finally.  I really didn't see the big deal against it.  I mean yeah, okay, the dialogue is cheese.  The plot, what there was, was cheese.   But this is (and read carefully) A GODZILLA MOVIE.  Plot and anything that really resembles realism gets shot down just by that.  Add to that that it IS a Roland Emmerich movie (good guy, but ID4, etc taints him a tad) and you know it's going to be kinda heavy handed.  This isn't a change your life type of flick.  It's a shut-off-the-brain-and-enjoy-the-ride type of flick.  View it that way, and you'll have a good time.

Favorite after movie quote: "So what were the French Secret Service doing there exactly?  Where they there to tell everyone exactly when was the right time to surrender? 'Ze zituation is hopeless.  We must zurrender and align ourzelves with ze lizard.  Pass the bagettes.' "

One problem I had was some of the CGI stuff wasnt' quite right.  Mostly stuff I noticed and picked up on, and it didn't seem too terribly bad, so it was my nit-picking I guess.

What was the deal with giving half of the cast to Simpson's cast members?  I mean they did a good job and all, but sheesh.  Did they sign a contract with Matt Groening to get time off or something?  

Who knew New York cabs could go through so damn much and still be so drivable??  Now THAT'S a GM ad.

Finally:  one note to the writers:  Um the Siskel and Ebert jokes wore thin in like 5 minutes.  Thanks for beating us over the head with it, and making sure we all got the joke by doing the thumbs up/thumbs down at the end.  Really.  It made it oh so much more enjoyable.  Bleagh.  :/

(But hey, after that I still enjoyed it...  but then again I only paid matinee price too...)

See you at E3.  Stop by, say hi.

And to think we were touting the addictiveness and fun of Worms 2 way back when...

That X-Files finale was something else.  Even helped to take the mind off of more painful stuff that has happened as of late.  A fantastic way to segue into the movie.  "Mulder's going rogue." Heheh

It's amazing how cathartic work can become when life really screws you over.  It can really take your mind off of the bullshit of life.  

Oh and one more thing.  This one goes out to all the people that try to tell me that software piracy is victimless and non-violent retalliation against the man... :)
