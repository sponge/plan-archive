Welp, got back from my 3 day vacation stuff... everything was taken care of, and I'm glad to say I was neither killed, nor did I do it.  (Confused yet?  Good. Now you know how I feel all the time...)

News At Work Dept.:  Well, been doing dome more work on the weapon models.  Got some help in getting them done in time for everything too.  Thank GOD for Voin's help... thought I was gonna be buried in them all alone! :)  Now I'm going back and adding carried versions of the weapons (helps keep the poly count low AND adds details to the carried weapons, so there's more depth than just texture mapping alone...

Free Plug Dept.:  NewTek!  Lightwave! A God-send!

Gotta Learn Something New Dept.:  Gotta learn HTML stuph... or else download a cheap-ass editor... either way this text stuff has to go!

Special Thanks to:  all the people who wished me birthday greets and gifts (especially my girlfriend... the Gargoyles are just too cool and on my desk!)

Personal Note Dept.:  

To John Romero:  be nice to the Keyboards and computers... quit bashing them... there's probably some group out there that will turn you in for peripheral abuse...

To John Romero, Pt. II:  already know about the random respawn thing... came back from my trip, my car had respawned randomly away from where I left it... then it respawned again (attached to a tow truck) in front of my house, and the bastards...er...kind gentlemen who "found" it respawned in a 10'x10' cell.  Neat huh?

Hot Damn Tamale, Charlie!

Today is my 25th birthday!  Get all sorts of loot!  My insurance rates drop dramatically!  All in all a good day... EXCEPT...

Celebrated a little too much last night at some various places specializing in elixirs of alcoholic bliss.  This morning, was woken up 30 minutes later than I was supposed to be at work.  Yeah... safe to say that I was lucky enough to have life smack me upside the head with the baseball bat of reality.  So if there are any models that look a bit skewed coming out of me today, we all know why. :)

HANG-O-VER (n) 1. Life's way of saying "don't have fun next time!"

Anyway I hope everyone had a good and safe Memorial Day Weekend.

More news as things progress... (and they're progressing at an exponential rate...)
Vertigo's CD Rotation of the week:
					Sugar, "Copper Blue"
					Foo Fighters, "Foo Fighters"
					Primus, "Sailing the Seas of Cheese"
					Cake, "Fashion Nugget"
					Various Artists, "Saturday Morning"
