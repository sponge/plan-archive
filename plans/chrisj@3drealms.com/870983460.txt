What is it about Texas that driving in rain turns everyone on the road into collective village idiots?  No one, not ONE person knows what driving in rain is about.  Hint: it's about a little extra caution on the roads, NOT STOPPING ON THE BLOODY FREEWAY!!!  I swear, you'd think that people had never seen rain before and either a)were afraid that the gods were sending down a plague that everyone should fear, or b)decided they needed to examine each and every freaking raindrop to please their curiosity.  Either way, Texas drivers suck in rain.  And don't even think about facing a bunch of them when there's ice on the road (and I've lived here my whole bleeding life!).

Spawn the movie blows large chunks of goo.  Big time.  The soundtrack is better, though.  Spawn can be best summed up as: Gratuitous cape effects.  The Mind's Eye does Hell.  Very cool Violator stuff.  Rest is crap.  and I was looking forward to it too.  Ah well.

Now working on Anachronox full time.  Very cool.

More later.

Ow,  Brain hurts.  A lot.

Basically this is from a variety of reasons.  The main one is being best man for a friend of mine's wedding.  What a pain in the ass THIS is.  Sure it'll all be worth it for a variety of reasons... namely the drinkage and the...er...view, but it's a pain in the ass until it happens.  Luckily it will ALL be over tonight.

Finest movie title I've seen in a long time: "The Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell."  Saw this one in the rental setup of Hastings of all places.  The box said 'In the fine tradition of Jurassic Park and Carnosaur'... uh-huh.  Yeah.  Sure.  Whatever.

(Tie for second place for Movie Title Kudos: 'Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death', and 'Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-rama'.  Y'know I think Joe Bob Briggs must be smiling huge shit-eating grins about now.  Thank god for Cable and straight-to-video.  The drive-in movie ethic is alive and well thanks to these inventions of American ingenuity...)

In no particular order I'd like to say hi to Chris Garzuzi, Michel A. Saleh, Paul DuBois, and Paul Nielsen, who all took the time and drop a line saying they recognized the fine (if slightly confusing) writing of T.S. Eliot's 'The Wasteland'.  (Okay Michel was wrong, but there was mention of Neil Gaiman's Sandman, so you get Half-Credit)  To see the entire epic, jump to http://www.lexmark.com/data/poem/eliot01.html

Having a wonderful time.  Wish you were here.
