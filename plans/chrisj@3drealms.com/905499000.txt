Interesting things are afoot, o children of the shootable polygon...

Question for those of you using 3D Studio MAX  out there.  I've heard of some interesting backward compatibility (incompatability?) problems going between 3D Studio MAX 1.x and MAX R2.x... has anyone run into these problems?  Same for Character Studio 1.x and 2.x.  (For what it's worth I'm looking at this primarily from an animating standpoint, not modeling, if that will help in some of your assessments...)  

I'd LOVE to find out from Kinetix themselves, but as there is absolutely no email support that I can find for them, and phone support is a whopping $65 a pop, just for some simple information, I thought I'd check and see what you kids had to say out there.  Thanks in advance (though I'll probably thank you again anyways).

Traffic tickets suck.  Traffic tickets that you forget about suck worse.  Results of the traffic tickets you forget about suck the worst.

Support bacteria. They're the only culture some people have.
