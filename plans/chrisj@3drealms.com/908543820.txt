This is my plan and my plan alone.  It doesn't necessarily reflect the thoughts and/or viewsof my employers.  And even if it did, I doubt they'd admit it.

Whoever stated that matter can not be created, never had a sinus infection.  I think in the past 24 hours or so I have single-handedly created about 30 pounds of tranlucent brown goo and blown it out of my head.

Either that, or the part of my brain that does long division has been rejected my body and I blew THAT out of my head.

Either way, it's pretty nasty.  I don't recommend it.
