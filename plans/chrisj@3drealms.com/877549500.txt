Well, er...um...yeah... okay then.

Very cool stuff showing up in Anachronox now.  The new Boots has seen the engine (and been seen in the engine even), and is by far a marked improvement.  Jay and Lee are to be commended.  Some more of the monsters/NPC's/main characters have been in the engine in one fashion or another and also are looking good.  Said it before and I'll say it again: this is undoubtedly THE company to be at for a whole slew of reasons...

I suppose you read in Tom's .plan about Drunken Monkey doing some music for Anachronox.  This is extremely double-fudge-a-licious for me, simply because the lead singer, Tony Diaz (or if you prefer, Antonio Diaz, Jr.)happens to be a decently old friend of mine.  I used to run sound for some gigs he had way back when, when he was front man for Deep Domain (but he got out of that somewhat crappy band, so don't hold it against him) at which point he was assimilated by a band called Uncle Pete's Parade (I think that was the name) and lo and behold they became Big Mouth Buzz.  A couple of name changes (and one member change) later and you have Drunken Monkey.  Very cool band indeed.  If you want to hear some stuff of theirs they are playing this Friday the 24th and Club Clearview in Dallas at 10:00 pm, and headlining a show on the 29th (I believe) at Club Dada, also in Deep Ellum.  (If you can't tell, I talked to Tony last night).  Very cool stuff, and as Tony mentioned, anyone's welcome.

and so it goes...

Yeah, whatever.

Okay okay okay... the whole Jesus thing was a joke... I am not ultra religious... or even pseudo religious, I guess... it was a joke, nothing less, nothing more.  Stop trying to read things into it.

Also, in the new issue of PCGamer there is an add in the back for pre-ordering Daikatana.  Yow.  How's THAT for planning ahead on their part?  Sheesh!

Oh yeah... PhrogMan has gone ahead, above and beyond and over the top, and added mailing lists for Anachronox, Doppleganger, and Dominion.  Phreeeeeow!  head on over to http://daikatana.warzone.com to get the skinny on it.

...and I had no idea that my car had become such the subject of speculation... :)

Hung out in #ionstorm on pseudo last night during StormFront.  Kinda cool.  Sparsely populated (where are you people?) but cool none the less.  Shouts out to Sandmoose and PhantoM especially.

PCGamer (http://www.pcgamer.com) has a very cool Anachronox preview up on their site.  Extremely good stuff.  Lots of good information, so check it out.

Mailing list for Daikatana news run by the Daikatana shrine (on WarZone).  just send a little email thingy to Majordomo@warzone.com and in the body type 'subscribe daikatana' (no quotes, all lowercase) and your set.  Neat huh?  (Note, due to confusion; this is a mailing list ran by and for people who are fans of Ion Storm and waiting for the game.  There is no real official sponsorship of the thing... although a few of us are on it seeing what you kids have to say...*grin*)

As far as Anachronox goes, still animating and skinning away, and texturing, and building and rebuilding and all of that.  Eidos came by for a little peek yesterday.  We're all moving on and doing some major leaps-and-bounds type stuff.  Very cool to be a part of this team, not to mention this company.

Jesus saves sinners... and redeems them for valuable prizes!

Laters for you.
