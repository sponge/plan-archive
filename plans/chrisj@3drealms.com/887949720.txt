Wow... 8 minutes past midnight.  Delerium is setting in and I think I can see through time.  I must do this more often.

First and foremost:  Congratulations to Doug Wolf.  He's leaving ION Storm for much MUCH greener pastures in California at Digital Domain.  One of those things that really says "You've arrived."  It was definitely an honor to have worked with you at ION Doug.  I look forward to seeing your work on the 'other' screens now. :)  Just kinda cool to think I'm gonna see a guy's name ion the credits for feature films sometime and actually be able to say I know the guy and talk to him alot.  (Remember:  you DID say you'd keep in touch :)

Here's an interesting tidbit of info:
>> Subject: Back to the Future II: Spooky
>If you remember the movie "Back to the Future II" you will recall that
>Biff goes to the future and steals a Sports Almanac, where in turn he goes
>back to the past to give it to young Biff.  As we all know Young Biff was

>In an obscure line you hear young Biff say "Florida is going to win the
>World Series in 1997, yeah right."
>
>This movie came out in 1987, ten years before the Marlins did actually
>win the world series.  And what's really weird is ... Florida didn't
>even have a baseball team in 1987.  The Marlins are only 5 years old.
Spooky, huh?

Sorry, had to get that outta my system.  Next time should be something tangible and not tinged with delirium.

This way to the egress.

Ah... gloomy days.  Coupled with the fact that I've listened to the entirety of The Wall yesterday and today while getting into the groove should make all my models and animations particularly depressed.  I think one of them actually committed suicide in the middle of "Goodbye Blue Sky", but I might be mistaken... :)

So down to business, then.  Things are simply rolling along pretty well, couple of things have come up and been taken care of.  Let's just say that after talking at length with Kiwi (and Nick too, when he's coherent *grin*), and bouncing ideas back and forth off of each other, I have a greater respect for what these code monkeys do all the time. :)  Couple of tricks seem to be coming out of all of this on both sides.  You're gonna get a kick out of it I think.

Mike and I have been plugging away at animations and such, again bouncing ideas off of each other.  As a result, I find myself having (or just wanting mostly) to change and or redo a couple of things, but for the better, so I can live with it, at least until my seven-day waiting period is up. :)  

Brian, who I occasionally have to smack around with the baseball bat of reality, has been just tearing it up with the weapons models and anims.  Once you pound it into his head that a rock isn't necessarily the type of weapon we're looking for, he's good to go. :)  Seriously, he's taken some of these weapons and done some stuff to them that is actually different than I had envisioned them by simply looking at the model.  Tres Cool.


Finally, another conversation, this one with my father last weekend. (Yes I'm 25, and I still speak to my folks, it ain't a crime!)

DAD:  I hate when people talk about winning the lottery and it not changing them much.  If I won the lottery, I'd become the most annoying son-of-a-bitch you've ever seen.

ME:  So you're saying it wouldn't change you much, then?

DAD:  I guess so.

What can I say?  I come from excellent genetic stock. :)

Hmmm. Enough for now.
