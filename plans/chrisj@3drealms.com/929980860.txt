Congratulations to the Stars on telling every writer who said Dallas didn't deserve Lord Stanley's Cup to piss off and bringing it home to Dallas for the first of hopefully MANY times to come.

Note to Lindy Ruff:  quit whining.  It's not like yours is the first Buffalo team to lose a championship to a Dallas team.  You're just upholding a tradition at this point.  ;)

Another unrelated non-Duke thing: this came up this weekend between a friend and I (from film studies at UNT), and as we were unable to find a really dead-set answer, I'm hoping someone else could help.  Conerning copyright law, if a book/manuscript/poem/whatever was written by a person who is now deceased, and the work has been in the public eye for a while, what is the law concerning using it as a source for a script or something of that nature, the licensing of the material, etc?  (I'm talking about authors such as George Orwell, or even going back to Edgar Allan Poe or H. G. Wells)  It's just bugging me art this point, and I wante a definitive answer, if it's available.
