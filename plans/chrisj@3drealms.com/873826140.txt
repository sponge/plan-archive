Hot Damn Tamale, Charlie...  Doug, Lee, Jay Hosfelt and I just cranked out a bejeezus load of models for Anachronox this past week.  This thing will rock.  Nuff said.  The more I see these things the more I see the power of the vision Tom has had for this game... or is the correct term epic?  I like that one better.

FF7:  Looks tres cool.  Very nice.  Check it out.  Nuff said again.

To Eric Smith and Marc Pearson:  You guys rock.  These were the only two who knew about Tom Lehrer.  The man was a genius on many levels.   (Not only with sick songs and such...)

Outta here for the weekend, gotta rest up for the massive amount of animation, which still isn't much when you figure we have done roughly...oh... 1/10th (or less) of the actual creature models for the damn thing.  Like I said.  This thing will rock.  

Oh and one more thing... I envy all the people who will be at ECTS this weekend...  There's gonna be great stuff out there.  Wish I could go.  Ah well, maybe next year.

Laters for you.

(Oh yeah... Dawg, Xerxes, Gama', etc... drop a line sometime...)

First off, Happy Birthday Tom Hall (yesterday) and all of that stuff.  His is by no means the first birthday here in the office, just the first one (at least that I've seen) that was awarded both cake AND ice cream.  Ah, the advantages of being the designer.

Secondly, we have an 'official' Lead Artist guy, and that would be Lee Perry.  So now, all of the general shit that the artists take will be directed full force to him, and then divided amongst the rest of us.  Unfortunately, now that Lee is officially 'The Man', me and the other 'oppressed brothas and sistas' on Team Anachronox will fight the power and the oppression that he represents.  Power to the People!!  

(Sorry... kinda been having fun catching all the Shaft movies, etc.  Great watching.  Really great with liberal amounts of alcoholic bliss trown in for good measure.)

Looks like FF7 hit the shelves today.  Should be cool to see it in action.  

Oh yeah one more thing...  if ANYone can tell me where/who this is from I will be duly impressed.  (Yes, I already know it... I want to know if you know it.)

"...Fracture my spine,
And swear that you're mine, 
As we dance to the Masochism Tango."

Laters for you.
