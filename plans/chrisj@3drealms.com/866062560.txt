Nose to the Grindstone Dept.:  Okay this may have been the "Stuff at Work Dept." oh-so-recently, but it's time to knuckle down for E3.  And speaking of getting the game togeher (nice segue, huh?), I have to say that Kee is abso-freaking-lutely the man.  We now have the ability to transfer models directly into the game with no problem directly out of Lightwave.  It is absolutely beautiful to see this happen, especially to watch it increase our productivity.  And now he's working on making DaiKatana GL compliant (see the Daily Informant for more details at our Website).  

Nose to the Grindstone Dept., Part II:  The animations are just beautiful, at least what I've seen of them... got to play DaiKatana with some of the monsters in and it's almost spooky to watch some of it; who would have thought the smoothness was possible from looking at its predecessor?  If the other Quake-Engine Games are making the mammoth improvments that all facets of this company are making, the game-player segment of the populous is in for a very fun upcoming year, indeed...

Amazing View Dept.:  FINALLY got to go and see the space we will be moving into yesterday.  Wow.  Spooge-Fest extreme.  Not only is this company going to be (if it isn't already) the premier game making skunkworks in the industry, but the permanent facilities will give new meaning to the term "Awe-Inspiring."

Lunch-time Fun Dept.:  Unfortunately, there wasn't nearly as much fun at lunch today as there was yesterday (see Voin's plan for details... hehe).  Damn.  Looks like we'll have to start bringing Russ along all the time so he can start the catastrophe chain-reaction...

And so until next time (which will probably be after the next time I manage to get some sleep...),

Fightin' Against the Man Dept.:  Well, this was a fun weekend... Got a message from the lovely Texas Department of Public Safety saying they were going to suspend my license and plates for a ticket that I got two years ago and that I had to do this and this and that to get it cleared or else I would have to pay them a reinstatement fee and my insurance rates would jump.  I got it cleared up, but I now have an idea what drives people to join militias...

(And of course, I probably now have an FBI tail after saying THAT... sheesh)

Stuff at Work Dept.:  Anyways, it looks like some heads are definitely going to turn at E3.  Got the models done (and in the right hands too) for the weapons, and continue to work on the ones for the final product.  The levels are beautiful... I can't say anything else.  Visually exciting, foreboding, sometimes claustrophobic, and beautiful all at the same time... it's really a sight to behold.  (Those screenshots WILL be up someday... promise!) :)  I just wish I was attending E3 so I could see the gazes we get when we unveil the little bugger.  Am starting to see my weapons WITH the skins on them too... Wow... actually make my stuff look great!!  (I think our skin/texture artists could make a Super Soaker look foreboding... but we may have to wait a while to justify that claim.)

Unsolicited Movie Review Dept.:  Well, you aren't going to see a movie review here until Men In Black.  Nyah.  'Nuf said.

Soda Pop Wars Dept.:  I gotta go with Dr. Pepper.  So ha.
