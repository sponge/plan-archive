Last night a friend of mine got the Mac Version of Quake (well, the free CompUSA disk, anyhoo).  I gotta say the guys at Lion (or is that "The Artisits Formerly Known as Lion"?) did a nice job on the port it looks like.  Seems to run pretty smooth even on a low end PowerPC Macintosh, which he has, although the resolution and detail levels both had to be cut to the lowest to get a really decent framerate... freak ought to get a faster computer... or maybe even a PC. (The horror!  The horror!)  He's been complaining a good long time about the lack of any good games for the Mac in a while.  Now I hope this will quell the griping, if only for a little bit.  (Oh yeah... as far as controls... the one button mouse thing COULD very well be a detriment... just a thought.)

Air Force One:  decent movie.. great acting.  Completely cheeseball ending.  What happened?  Did the writers just realize "hey... we have ABSOLUTELY no idea how to end this thing...um... let's use some totally crappy movie convention shit, and throw in a stunt that would snap a person's spine in 47 different places."  (Afterwards, I saw there was a novelization of this movie already (which movie doesn't have one?) but I figured the last chapter would consist solely of "Epilogue: Lots of visual crap that no one would believe, shot with all the grace of a water- buffalo in heat.  Good guys win."  If you can accept that go see it.  The acting is great.  It's the effects that... well... you know...

Anachronox:  Rocks.  And will rock.  For now check out Squishy's Anachronox Cantina [http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/8007/ (a nod to Sandmoose perhaps?), The Bricks [http://games.nextlevel.net/bricks/index.htm], and Anachronews [http://www.anachronews.com] (in no discernible order, of course.).  And no, I'm not plugging any one site or anything like that, but somehow, these guys get ahold of info on the game, and are pretty decently designed as well.  No free plugs here... er... until I get paid an 'advertising fee', of course.

"Booze.  It's what's for dinner."

Laters for you.

What is it about Texas that driving in rain turns everyone on the road into collective village idiots?  No one, not ONE person knows what driving in rain is about.  Hint: it's about a little extra caution on the roads, NOT STOPPING ON THE BLOODY FREEWAY!!!  I swear, you'd think that people had never seen rain before and either a)were afraid that the gods were sending down a plague that everyone should fear, or b)decided they needed to examine each and every freaking raindrop to please their curiosity.  Either way, Texas drivers suck in rain.  And don't even think about facing a bunch of them when there's ice on the road (and I've lived here my whole bleeding life!).

Spawn the movie blows large chunks of goo.  Big time.  The soundtrack is better, though.  Spawn can be best summed up as: Gratuitous cape effects.  The Mind's Eye does Hell.  Very cool Violator stuff.  Rest is crap.  and I was looking forward to it too.  Ah well.

Now working on Anachronox full time.  Very cool.

More later.

Ow,  Brain hurts.  A lot.

Basically this is from a variety of reasons.  The main one is being best man for a friend of mine's wedding.  What a pain in the ass THIS is.  Sure it'll all be worth it for a variety of reasons... namely the drinkage and the...er...view, but it's a pain in the ass until it happens.  Luckily it will ALL be over tonight.

Finest movie title I've seen in a long time: "The Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell."  Saw this one in the rental setup of Hastings of all places.  The box said 'In the fine tradition of Jurassic Park and Carnosaur'... uh-huh.  Yeah.  Sure.  Whatever.

(Tie for second place for Movie Title Kudos: 'Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death', and 'Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-rama'.  Y'know I think Joe Bob Briggs must be smiling huge shit-eating grins about now.  Thank god for Cable and straight-to-video.  The drive-in movie ethic is alive and well thanks to these inventions of American ingenuity...)

In no particular order I'd like to say hi to Chris Garzuzi, Michel A. Saleh, Paul DuBois, and Paul Nielsen, who all took the time and drop a line saying they recognized the fine (if slightly confusing) writing of T.S. Eliot's 'The Wasteland'.  (Okay Michel was wrong, but there was mention of Neil Gaiman's Sandman, so you get Half-Credit)  To see the entire epic, jump to http://www.lexmark.com/data/poem/eliot01.html

Having a wonderful time.  Wish you were here.
