Project:  Lots of stuff.  I'm all over the place; I'm like the wind.

This is my plan and my plan alone.  It doesn't necessarily reflect the thoughts and/or viewsof my employers.  And even if it did, I doubt they'd admit it.

Wow.  It's amazing what one can accomplish when one actually gets up at 7:00 in the AM, works out, and actually takes care o' bidness...

Just wanted to say farewell to Chris Day from the 3D Portal stuff, and good luck down at UT.  Do it for the Yad. ;)

Anyone out there use Rhino3d?  I keep hearing some interesting things about this tool, but was wondering what kind of reviews there were from people using it for real-time game-type stuff.  Any insight would be quite welcome.

Truly amazingly cool stuff going on around these parts, and on all fronts too.  Oh, and if you get a chance to check out this months PCGames, they have many really choice words about all of our stuff.  Tres cool.

Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
