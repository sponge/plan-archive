Don't take Life too seriously... no one gets out alive anyways.

Oh and if anyone out there can tell me what movie the song "Everything Right is Wrong Again" By They Might Be Giants is in it would be greatly appreciated.  (It's in the closing credits as best I can tell... that's all I saw of the movie actually, but the fact that a TMBG song of any type was in a movie struck me dumbfounded.  And now it's driving me crazy.)

Sorry.  No news or interesting things about the game or Animating for now.  Stay Tuned dear viewer...
