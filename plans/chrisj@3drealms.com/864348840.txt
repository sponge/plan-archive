Yes Jeff... I am bigger than you... that's why my callsign is "Vertigo."  It's all a height thing.  Duh. :)

Getting some real-time/low-poly models for Daikatana up for the game.  Pretty sweet if I do say so myself.  Deanna and I both are doing these (albeit she started on them before I did), and I gotta say I couldn't be in better company.  Also hats off to the Mad Samoan for the little tips and tricks.  Keeping the poly-count **WAY** low and wouldn't have been able to be getting them out like that without his tips...

Open letter to Todd Porter:  IT WAS NOT ME WHO RIPPED THE BIG GREEN STANKY CLOUD O' FLATULENCE!!!  Jim was right:  he who smelt it dealt it.  :)

Started Playing _Redneck Rampage_ (Interplay).  Fun game, although I haven't notice it using the Build engine as well as it possibly could... yet.  But it does my native Texan heart proud to see any game that refers to an AK-47 as a "Huntin' Rifle"...

Although my personal opinion of games that are out now is that _Interstate 76_ just rocks balls... (of course, it too is set in Texas...)

And remember kids:  Jesus Saves Sinners - and redeems them for valuable prizes!!

Week number two...

Finally got myself up and running full speed now.  Looking forward to being a contributing member of society.

Have to say the meshes and textures are looking better and better... this here Daikatana game is definitely gonna be something to behold.  

Free plug department: (These are my own opinions/plugs, and not officially supported by ION Storm, except as noted, so nyah.)
Go see "Eye on Ion" at http://ciholding.com/ion/
This place shows promise of being a really good ION Storm information page (especially if one of the blanket sites like Planetquake, Stomped, or Telefragged picks it up...) plus the guy who runs it is a damn fine individual to boot. Also Sandmoose's Daikatana Cabana at Stomped is a nice spot as well.

Personal note department: Started looking for a new car (seven days to my birthday for those of you who wish to buy one for me). :)  Looking at the Dodge Dakota Sport, Ford Explorer Sport, Avenger ES... of course I'd LOVE to have a Plymouth Prowler, but that's just me.

					    Sugar, "File Under: Easy Listening"
					    Moby, "Rare"
 					    Squirrel Nut Zippers, "Hot"
					    Cake, "Fashion Nugget"
					    Pink Floyd, "Pulse"

Forgot to add this little two cents in yesterday...

I've cleared 193,000 miles on my little blue Prelude and was thinking "Hey, Chris... you could REALLY use a new car..."

Well as my 25th birthday is on May 27th (only 11 shopping days, kids!) I will be accepting gifts and cars to celebrate.  Please send all of your warmly-thought-of gifts to me care of ION Storm... 

Seriously though... Just want to thank every one for making my initiation here at the Storm only SLIGHTLY abusive and extremely well meaning...
