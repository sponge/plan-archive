Week number two...

Finally got myself up and running full speed now.  Looking forward to being a contributing member of society.

Have to say the meshes and textures are looking better and better... this here Daikatana game is definitely gonna be something to behold.  

Free plug department: (These are my own opinions/plugs, and not officially supported by ION Storm, except as noted, so nyah.)
Go see "Eye on Ion" at http://ciholding.com/ion/
This place shows promise of being a really good ION Storm information page (especially if one of the blanket sites like Planetquake, Stomped, or Telefragged picks it up...) plus the guy who runs it is a damn fine individual to boot. Also Sandmoose's Daikatana Cabana at Stomped is a nice spot as well.

Personal note department: Started looking for a new car (seven days to my birthday for those of you who wish to buy one for me). :)  Looking at the Dodge Dakota Sport, Ford Explorer Sport, Avenger ES... of course I'd LOVE to have a Plymouth Prowler, but that's just me.

Vertigo's CD Rotation this week:  Sugar, "File Under: Easy Listening"
(AKA Music to Make Mayhem By)     Moby, "Rare"
 					    Squirrel Nut Zippers, "Hot"
					    Cake, "Fashion Nugget"
					    Pink Floyd, "Pulse"

Forgot to add this little two cents in yesterday...

I've cleared 193,000 miles on my little blue Prelude and was thinking "Hey, Chris... you could REALLY use a new car..."

Well as my 25th birthday is on May 27th (only 11 shopping days, kids!) I will be accepting gifts and cars to celebrate.  Please send all of your warmly-thought-of gifts to me care of ION Storm... 

Seriously though... Just want to thank every one for making my initiation here at the Storm only SLIGHTLY abusive and extremely well meaning...
