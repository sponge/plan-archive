Forgot to add this little two cents in yesterday...

I've cleared 193,000 miles on my little blue Prelude and was thinking "Hey, Chris... you could REALLY use a new car..."

Well as my 25th birthday is on May 27th (only 11 shopping days, kids!) I will be accepting gifts and cars to celebrate.  Please send all of your warmly-thought-of gifts to me care of ION Storm... 

Seriously though... Just want to thank every one for making my initiation here at the Storm only SLIGHTLY abusive and well-meaning...

....the day started looking like crap, but it's gonna be a good day to go to Six Flags after all...

Wow.  First week into my history here at the Storm.  Still surprised that I got the chance to come on board during the gearing up for E3, but damn I'm glad they did.  What a great job this is... if you have the means, I highly suggest getting one yourself.  Getting up to speed on the in-house software and stuff, getting my first assignments for modeling (presumably in DaiKatana) soon afterwards...

Well, the ball war that Squirrel was talking about has definitely escalated, and there is definitely some in-fighting among the artist factions here...  Russell seems to be the main aggressor, but I think he'll be getting his ass kicked pretty handily here pretty soon... it happens to him in Deathmatch, why not in the great amazing ball war as well?  :)

Seriously though, everybody has been extremely cool about helping me out so far, and I look forward to helping put some kickass visuals in the games...

Personal Haiku (a la Jeff Wand):

Deathmatching at work
Getting my ass kicked never
Paid off so damn well.

(eh... I tried)
