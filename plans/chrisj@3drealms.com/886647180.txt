Conversation with a friend:

Me: =+About to sneeze+=
Friend:  Look at the light!  Stare at the light!
Me: =+SNEEZE!+=
Friend: If you had stared at the light, you wouldn't have sneezed
Me:  No, I would've sneezed, but would have suffered such intense retina burns, I wouldn't remeber sneezing.

(Sometimes, one's friends need a little smackage upside the head, methinks.)

Looking at the Gamespot UK stuff on the New Breed of "Quake Killers" (Geez, I'm sick of that term... why not try something like.. I don't know... 3d Shooters perhaps?), and there's an intersting little blurb called 'Where's the Killing Joke?'

http://www.gamespot.co.uk/news/1998/01/300.html

Interesting little read, talking about how humor has all but left the id games of late, and wondering why...  Um... intersting premise, although I think they go just a tad overboard inferring id may be just programmers devoid of humor and "Darlings."  A bit heavy-handed on GSUK's part, I'd say, but oh well.  (Nice little blurb on Duke in there too, by the way. :)

Back to the fun...
