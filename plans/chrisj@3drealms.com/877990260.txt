DAMN YOU DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME...

Okay then.

Drunken Monkey was a good show.  I HIGHLY recommend making it out to the show on the 29th at Club Dada if you're in Dallas this Wednesday.  They're headlining, the only band there, so the snooty fuckheads that came to see their friend's rich-bitch mama's-boy band won't fuck it up for everyone.  Okay then.

Wow.  45 cents.  What a bargain.

Overheard at dinner out Saturday night: "You kicked the seeing-eye dog in the head?  You Asshole!  Now I can just see this poor blind man, with a seeing-eye dog, which in turn has a little seeing-eye dog... maybe a chihuahua."

Well, er...um...yeah... okay then.

Very cool stuff showing up in Anachronox now.  The new Boots has seen the engine (and been seen in the engine even), and is by far a marked improvement.  Jay and Lee are to be commended.  Some more of the monsters/NPC's/main characters have been in the engine in one fashion or another and also are looking good.  Said it before and I'll say it again: this is undoubtedly THE company to be at for a whole slew of reasons...

I suppose you read in Tom's .plan about Drunken Monkey doing some music for Anachronox.  This is extremely double-fudge-a-licious for me, simply because the lead singer, Tony Diaz (or if you prefer, Antonio Diaz, Jr.)happens to be a decently old friend of mine.  I used to run sound for some gigs he had way back when, when he was front man for Deep Domain (but he got out of that somewhat crappy band, so don't hold it against him) at which point he was assimilated by a band called Uncle Pete's Parade (I think that was the name) and lo and behold they became Big Mouth Buzz.  A couple of name changes (and one member change) later and you have Drunken Monkey.  Very cool band indeed.  If you want to hear some stuff of theirs they are playing this Friday the 24th and Club Clearview in Dallas at 10:00 pm, and headlining a show on the 29th (I believe) at Club Dada, also in Deep Ellum.  (If you can't tell, I talked to Tony last night).  Very cool stuff, and as Tony mentioned, anyone's welcome.

and so it goes...

Yeah, whatever.
