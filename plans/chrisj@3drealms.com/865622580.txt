D'oh!  I wish I had known earlier in the week that our little DaiKatana hero wasn't ambidextrous... converting the models to right-handed from left-handed (you read right kids... HANDS!!! ooh ahh!) Also, have gotten more of the concept art for the other weapons that I've been working on along with Voin... these things get better and better.  Yowza.  This will not be something that disappoints.  At all.

Wish I had gotten to go to the magical-musical-alcoholic-bliss-shindig last night (I promise I'll be at the next one, Will... I promise!).  Heard it was a good time had by all.  People meeting everyone, and everyone just basking in the good nature and fun that is the Dallas Gaming Community (well... most of the time.)  

And it looks like Polish got the skinny on another weapon out while he came to visit, too.  Check out QuakeMania for details (http://www.quakemania.com)

While you're at it, check out http://www.quakemania.com/ion/ too... Zep's _Eye on Ion_ has moved there and looks to show a bit more promise with his newfound host.  Also check out http://ionstorm.stomped.com (Sandmoose's Daikatan Cabana)... these are both (as far as I've seen) the best sources for the Storm-Related news out there... aside from our own Daily Informant, of course. :)

Hokay Dokay... Looks like it's time to make the plan a tiny bit more informative (I know I know... "Why start now?" ask the throngs of those seeking information, well, because I'm tired and have no real insane-or even loosely eccentric-thoughts within my little brainpan... so...)

News From Work Dept.:  Finally saw what Voin was talking about.  The Crossbow is very cool indeed when used in combat.  Like seeing guys roaming about looking like pin-cushions.  And when they gib, can you imagine pieces of the enemy, already on sticks just ripe for barbecue?  Yum!  Can't help thinking what Quake would have been like with this .  Think about it...

Seems like the work we're getting done increases exponentially.  E3 Weapons models are done (except for some mild tweaking if need be).  Some of the carried models are extremely sweet.  The animated creatures are just beautiful too. And Will's music... GAWD!  I've never been this impressed with a working team in my life... seriously.  This game is gonna rock... not only at E3, but massively as a final product too... 

Personal Bitch and Moan Dept.:  Not really a bitch or moan, but, has anyone else noticed that a lot of the architecture in Hexen II seems to be awfully flat/boxy?  I mean don't get me wrong, I think the game is absolutely beautiful, but I hope that the screenshots we've seen that show squared columns in the Roman-style architecture get changed to something more rounded... and that the doorways get more of an arched shape in some areas as well.. it kinda detracts from some of the other beautiful looking scenery in that game... but then again, that's just a personal opinion...
