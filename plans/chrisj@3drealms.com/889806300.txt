Stay tuned dear viewer...

Got this in the mail first thing today...

"It's Friday the 13th.  There's also gonna be a lunar eclipse, AND a full
moon.  Kind of a triple whammy.  Do you know where your insanity is?"

Don't know if this be the truth as far as all three happening, but I do know my insanity's been with me for a while now and we're very comfortable together the three of us, thank you very much. :)

ANYways, Lots of stuff been going on here.  Models and animations are getting to their proper places and such.  Chris' work on Cannibal is just amazing.  Undoubtedly one of the best in-house tools I've seen.  This thing has taken all new directions, and as a result, should make all of the game creatures and such extremely more dynamic.  What the hell does that mean you ask?  Not telling.  So nyah.  You'll see.

In a fit of lunacy earlier this week I brought a couple of Mystery Science Theater 3000s to the office.  Gonna have to watch sometime soonish....  "Mitchell!  Even his name says 'Uh... is that a beer?"

Never judge a man till you have walked a mile in his shoes, 'cuz by then, he's a mile away, you've got his shoes, and you can say whatever the hell you want to.

reality.sys corrupted. universe halted. reboot (y/n)?

(Side note to Lithium:  It wasn't Cool Moe Dee that did Funky Cold Medina.  It was Tone Loc.  God, being old enough to have been coherent in the late 70s to mid 80s can really be a pain. :)

If infinite rednecks fired infinite shotguns at an infinite number of road signs, they'd eventually create all the great literary works of the world in braille.
