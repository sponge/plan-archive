Fightin' Against the Man Dept.:  Well, this was a fun weekend... Got a message from the lovely Texas Department of Public Safety saying they were going to suspend my license and plates for a ticket that I got two years ago and that I had to do this and this and that to get it cleared or else I would have to pay them a reinstatement fee and my insurance rates would jump.  I got it cleared up, but I now have an idea what drives people to join militias...

(And of course, I probably now have an FBI tail after saying THAT... sheesh)

Stuff at Work Dept.:  Anyways, it looks like some heads are definitely going to turn at E3.  Got the models done (and in the right hands too) for the weapons, and continue to work on the ones for the final product.  The levels are beautiful... I can't say anything else.  Visually exciting, foreboding, sometimes claustrophobic, and beautiful all at the same time... it's really a sight to behold.  (Those screenshots WILL be up someday... promise!) :)  I just wish I was attending E3 so I could see the gazes we get when we unveil the little bugger.  Am starting to see my weapons WITH the skins on them too... Wow... actually make my stuff look great!!  (I think our skin/texture artists could make a Super Soaker look foreboding... but we may have to wait a while to justify that claim.)

Unsolicited Movie Review Dept.:  Well, you aren't going to see a movie review here until Men In Black.  Nyah.  'Nuf said.

Soda Pop Wars Dept.:  I gotta go with Dr. Pepper.  So ha.

D'oh!  I wish I had known earlier in the week that our little DaiKatana hero wasn't ambidextrous... converting the models to right-handed from left-handed (you read right kids... HANDS!!! ooh ahh!) Also, have gotten more of the concept art for the other weapons that I've been working on along with Voin... these things get better and better.  Yowza.  This will not be something that disappoints.  At all.

Wish I had gotten to go to the magical-musical-alcoholic-bliss-shindig last night (I promise I'll be at the next one, Will... I promise!).  Heard it was a good time had by all.  People meeting everyone, and everyone just basking in the good nature and fun that is the Dallas Gaming Community (well... most of the time.)  

And it looks like Polish got the skinny on another weapon out while he came to visit, too.  Check out QuakeMania for details (http://www.quakemania.com)

While you're at it, check out http://www.quakemania.com/ion/ too... Zep's _Eye on Ion_ has moved there and looks to show a bit more promise with his newfound host.  Also check out http://ionstorm.stomped.com (Sandmoose's Daikatan Cabana)... these are both (as far as I've seen) the best sources for the Storm-Related news out there... aside from our own Daily Informant, of course. :)
