Just finished listening to the most recent StormFront, with the Andy brothers (Chang and Collins...no relation) and I gotta say... to the best of my knowledge there was no acid dropped or other illicit drugs taken before their turn on the show.  That's their usual thing.  Frightening, eh?

To Adam Coyne (hank of "hank and dweomer"... yknow... QuakeFinger?), Michael Caudill, Jeff Hanna, Todd K. Shaw, and Matthew Behunin:  you guys are the shit.  Thanks for the info on the song being in "Ed and His Dead Mother" (which I have seen parts of, but never enough to piece it all together.).  Although two of you scare me for actually being able to come up with knowledge that TMBG had a song in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie.  Not only that you knew that (GOD! I hope you actually didn't watch that) or that the band stooped to that movie's level.  Ah well.  you two know who you are.  I shant let the world know your pain... :)

Don't take Life too seriously... no one gets out alive anyways.

Oh and if anyone out there can tell me what movie the song "Everything Right is Wrong Again" By They Might Be Giants is in it would be greatly appreciated.  (It's in the closing credits as best I can tell... that's all I saw of the movie actually, but the fact that a TMBG song of any type was in a movie struck me dumbfounded.  And now it's driving me crazy.)

Sorry.  No news or interesting things about the game or Animating for now.  Stay Tuned dear viewer...
