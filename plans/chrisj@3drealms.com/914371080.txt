Project:  Lots of stuff. All of it cool.  You'll see.

This is my plan and my plan alone.  It doesn't necessarily reflect the thoughts and/or viewsof my employers.  And even if it did, I doubt they'd admit it.

Okay.  This is ridiculous.

This summer, people who came to Texas for the various gaming things were spontaneously combusting among the colonies of crickets involving themselves in hostile takeovers of large buildings.  Now, we're reaching high temperatures in the 20s... maybe... with wind chills of like -9 F (Last week it was in the mid to high 60s).  Insane.  Absolutely insane.  

The one good thing about this is that it finally (and not a moment too soon) feels like the holidays should.  So I just wanted to take the time and wish everyone a Merry Christmas, Happy Hannukah, or Other Secular Winter Holiday, as well as a good New Year, especially to the developers and the true gamers out there.  I think it'll be a good one in general and for games and gamers as well.

Have a good one kids.  We'll see you on the other side.
