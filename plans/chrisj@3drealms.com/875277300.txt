Marv Albert: heh.

Well if you haven't noticed go over to the ol' WebPage (www.ionstorm.com) click on the 'Games' section and then see what a magnificent job Noel's done with that bad boy.  Very cool stuff.  The only link in there that works is Daikatana, but it is some sweetness to see.  (click on the two models at the top of two of the three heroes, and the chaingunner at the bottom... how's THAT for a skinned model?  Our skin artist rocks balls. Nuff said.)

Got to sit in on Tom's chat-o-rama on MSN the other night.  Very cool.  Extremely good questions from everyone out there (yes Noel... even the chocolate body lotion question... heh).  You guys rock too.

Still animating like a banshee... ran into snags here and there, but other than small tweaks everyones stuff is looking real nice here on Anachronox.  (Jeez.  "looking real nice"... Christ I sound like something out of Sling Blade all of a sudden... Deliverance maybe.   Gotta stop that.)

Laters for you.

Just finished listening to the most recent StormFront, with the Andy brothers (Chang and Collins...no relation) and I gotta say... to the best of my knowledge there was no acid dropped or other illicit drugs taken before their turn on the show.  That's their usual thing.  Frightening, eh?

To Adam Coyne (hank of "hank and dweomer"... yknow... QuakeFinger?), Michael Caudill, Jeff Hanna, Todd K. Shaw, and Matthew Behunin:  you guys are the shit.  Thanks for the info on the song being in "Ed and His Dead Mother" (which I have seen parts of, but never enough to piece it all together.).  Although two of you scare me for actually being able to come up with knowledge that TMBG had a song in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie.  Not only that you knew that (GOD! I hope you actually didn't watch that) or that the band stooped to that movie's level.  Ah well.  you two know who you are.  I shant let the world know your pain... :)
