Hearing a song you know translated into Greek is a strangely mind-expanding, and ultimately a frightening experience.

I would like to FINALLY take the time and thank the people who have written and mentioned a) how impressed they were with the E3 version of Duke, and more importantly, b) the support the mojority have expressed on the engine change.  Yes, this is very belated, but it's meant all the same.  Thank you all.

Concerning the topic du jour of late, opinion and rumour --  I will admit that yes I like these things.  They're entertaining as hell.  It's not only interesting to hear and see what people have to say about us events as they happen (and in retrospect), but it's definitely a good thing to be kept on your toes as well.  People see through the utter bullshit that is PR... at least much of the time it's bovine excrement at least.  It's interesting to see people take hold of that, work through the layers of misdirection and surmise their own opinions.  In effect, rendering the PR machines incapable of doing their jobs effectively.  After all the difference between Public Relations and Propaganda in many cases are negligible (yes I was once a PR student as well as everything else I studied).

It amazes me that opinions can drive people to be so worried about their image and if the "camera is getting their best side" that they would be willing to drive away people who are opinionated... even when the opinionated ones are also doing them a service.

Opinions are a good thing.  They open new avenues of thought and keep your feet firmly planted on terra firma.  If you are willing to listen.  Otherwise, you sit there firmly entrenched in your own image of yourself, oblivious to what is really going on.

That having been said, I find myself compelled to mention that I place a higher value on hard fact.  I get the hard news first (CNN is always a good thing, and for FPS gaming, I find Blue, Voodoo Extreme and Scary indespensible).  It's a good thing to do.  The facts give you a solid grounding on which to understand (and form your own) opinions.  After all rumour and opinions grow from what is reported, or at least percieved, as fact.

Oh yeah, Duke is going well also.  E3 was definitely catharctic.  The subsequent fallout also tells me we're on the right track.  And so the work continues...

Mmmmm.  Overly sarcastic, cynical gaming news with no graphics or redeeming social value.  Fun stuff.

>>Link removed<<

Sorry, had to remove it as some people decided I was the one that wrote the freaking page, simply because I'm overly sarcastic by nature.  Bloody hell.  If you want the link email me and I'll be happy to give it to you.  But I'd hate to be possibly blamed at any turn for hurting the sensibilities of some overly sensitive self-absorbed people, even if I'm just providing a freaking web address, so the address is removed from the plan.  Jeez.

And for the record, I don't consider myself "overworked" at all.  I actually kinda enjoy this gig. ;)

Screw it.  Here it is.  Last time I bow down to the man.
