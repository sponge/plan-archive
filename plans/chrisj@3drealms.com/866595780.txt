Though I Walk Through the Valley of E3 Dept.:  Just got off of an interesting little hour or so of IRC on #ionstorm on EFNet, where me and the Mad Somoan (and to a lesser degree, Voin and Seb) were accosted by a throng of ravenous DaiKatana-wanters... hopefully we answered what we could, should be able to give a little more info after the big 4 day weekend party known as E3.  

E3 readiness Dept.:  Burning the cd now.  Should be ready for everyone to peruse and looks good.  I'm not going to let an ego or condescending remarks get in the way of anything: see for yourself, if you're going of course.  And personally I look forward to hearing words of wisdom and encouragement from you when you do... let me know what you think, in general, or specifically.  (My specific piece in the demo is the weapon models, both held and in the game--not the skins, if you're wondering)  Note: we're already tweaking and changing some things, so we may be ahead of you on your suggestions, but keep em coming.  If I can, I'll try and answer whoever writes me... it may take time, but I'll do my best...

Note to PhantoM (Deutschlander): Yes I know I misspelled them... I got lazy.  If it happens again, then I was lazy again... what can I say? :)

Looks like I'm not going to E3... no one ponied up the cash for me (not like I really expected it, but a guy can dream can't he?)... but I (and practically the whole crew I think) will be at QuakeCon 97 with bells on.  (They'll be the last thing you hear before you go gib... or before you gib me (I ain't THAT great...yet.) 

Welp that's about it.  Gonna go play a DM against the guys... letting loose the steam as it were...

Oh, and for those of you who want to know, when Voin(Peter) saw Mikiko in the game for the first time at my computer, his exact words were, "Dude... she's HOT dude!"  (I think he needs out more often...)

So until next time kids...

Ignoring Sleep and Fire Alarms Dept.:  Well, the whole group has been in high gear for a while now, working all weekend on DaiKatana, as well as preview snippets of Doppleganger and Anachronox (Side note: I'm thinking of designiong a game and calling it 'Gotterdamerung', just to keep with the unpronounceable-game-title trend we seem to have set for ourselves... *insert smart ass grin here*).  Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of view) I had to be out of town this weekend, so I missed the push.  Really wanted to, though... ah well.

The Game Itself Dept.:  Looks good.  I'm gonna can the ego and say just that.  Looks good... okay... DAMN good.  How's that?  

Wishes, Dreams and Aspirations Dept.:  Wish I was going to E3... if anyone has about 600 bucks they can loan me for plane tickets and food, I already have a place to stay and passes into the place, and in return I'll give you half of my freebies, an autographed picture, a subscription to the Rush Limbaugh Newletter (cuz no one else would want the damn thing), and Voin.  In fact I may just give him away for the helluvit. :)  Heh.

Seriously though, I do wish I was goin, but alas and alack, I am not... prolly for the best, I can see myself doing something REALLY stupid and getting the Richard Jewell ramrod treatment.  Ah well.

Justice Exists Outside Ito's Courtroom Dept.:  for those of you not in touch with reality, Tim McVeigh got the death penalty.  Good.  I think he should be tied to a support structure on a building, with explosives chained to him (just enough to bring down the building and maim him), and then the survivors and victims families should stone him as he climbs from the rubble of the building... but that's just me.

Well, that's it for now.  If anything happens right before E3, or at/to the office during E3, guess I'll throw it up here.  Look for E3 updates on Blue's News, Sandmoose's Daikatana Cabana, Zep's Eye on Ion, and Redwood's Quake Page, among others.  And until then...

"Hail Eris! All hail Discordia!"

Nose to the Grindstone Dept.:  Okay this may have been the "Stuff at Work Dept." oh-so-recently, but it's time to knuckle down for E3.  And speaking of getting the game togeher (nice segue, huh?), I have to say that Kee is abso-freaking-lutely the man.  We now have the ability to transfer models directly into the game with no problem directly out of Lightwave.  It is absolutely beautiful to see this happen, especially to watch it increase our productivity.  And now he's working on making DaiKatana GL compliant (see the Daily Informant for more details at our Website).  

Nose to the Grindstone Dept., Part II:  The animations are just beautiful, at least what I've seen of them... got to play DaiKatana with some of the monsters in and it's almost spooky to watch some of it; who would have thought the smoothness was possible from looking at its predecessor?  If the other Quake-Engine Games are making the mammoth improvments that all facets of this company are making, the game-player segment of the populous is in for a very fun upcoming year, indeed...

Amazing View Dept.:  FINALLY got to go and see the space we will be moving into yesterday.  Wow.  Spooge-Fest extreme.  Not only is this company going to be (if it isn't already) the premier game making skunkworks in the industry, but the permanent facilities will give new meaning to the term "Awe-Inspiring."

Lunch-time Fun Dept.:  Unfortunately, there wasn't nearly as much fun at lunch today as there was yesterday (see Voin's plan for details... hehe).  Damn.  Looks like we'll have to start bringing Russ along all the time so he can start the catastrophe chain-reaction...

And so until next time (which will probably be after the next time I manage to get some sleep...),
