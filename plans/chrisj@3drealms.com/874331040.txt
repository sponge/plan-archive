Wow... amazing how serene and peaceful it is here early in the morn'.  Too bad the flesh aint exactly up to getting here this early.  Ah well.

FF7:  Extremely cool.  Lots of good stuff.  Just been hitting it here and there just to get a good look at it and play around with it.  Unfortunately, "here and there" has become "here and all the freaking time" at some points.  Very addictive.  I can understand the opening results in Japan for sales (3 MILLION?? Jesus-H.-Christ-in-a-Birchbark-canoe-with-a-sidecar...)

This animation thing is pretty groovy... feeling up to speed and all on Lightwave bones... very nice stuff in many ways... extremely versatile, although rigidity seems to be a small problem in some places.  Anchor anchor anchor.   Ah well...

Public Service Announcement:  Knowing that a healthy amount of the people in the Quake and gaming communities (can't help but seperate the two, althought they kinda go hand in hand... but it just seems so... completely separate at some times.) are younger peoples... college students (like me, not-so-many moons ago), high schoolers, down to early teens and then some I feel I have to tell you some helpful advice... DO NOT GO FUCKING UP YOUR CREDIT RATING!!!  Not no how.  When they offer you that no annual fee credit card for the first year APR of 6.9%, tear it up, shove it in an envelope, and attach a note saying that you would like the companies to shove it up their asses at no fee to them.  These things are pure unadulterated evil.  Trust me on this one.  Trying to get financing on a car or (anything for that matter) that you NEED becomes an exercise in masochistic futility.  It aint worth it.  

(Needless to say, the little Prelude died at 200,683 miles on the odometer.  Pain in the ass ain't it?)

Ah well.  Hope you "Mark and 'member."

Laters for you.

To Charles E. Johnson:  Happy Birthday Dad.  Growing up watching you cuss out stuff that didn't work made me who I am today.  Thanks.  :)

Hot Damn Tamale, Charlie...  Doug, Lee, Jay Hosfelt and I just cranked out a bejeezus load of models for Anachronox this past week.  This thing will rock.  Nuff said.  The more I see these things the more I see the power of the vision Tom has had for this game... or is the correct term epic?  I like that one better.

FF7:  Looks tres cool.  Very nice.  Check it out.  Nuff said again.

To Eric Smith and Marc Pearson:  You guys rock.  These were the only two who knew about Tom Lehrer.  The man was a genius on many levels.   (Not only with sick songs and such...)

Outta here for the weekend, gotta rest up for the massive amount of animation, which still isn't much when you figure we have done roughly...oh... 1/10th (or less) of the actual creature models for the damn thing.  Like I said.  This thing will rock.  

Oh and one more thing... I envy all the people who will be at ECTS this weekend...  There's gonna be great stuff out there.  Wish I could go.  Ah well, maybe next year.

Laters for you.

(Oh yeah... Dawg, Xerxes, Gama', etc... drop a line sometime...)
