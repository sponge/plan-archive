Okay okay okay... the whole Jesus thing was a joke... I am not ultra religious... or even pseudo religious, I guess... it was a joke, nothing less, nothing more.  Stop trying to read things into it.

Also, in the new issue of PCGamer there is an add in the back for pre-ordering Daikatana.  Yow.  How's THAT for planning ahead on their part?  Sheesh!

...and I had no idea that my car had become such the subject of speculation... :)

Hung out in #ionstorm on pseudo last night during StormFront.  Kinda cool.  Sparsely populated (where are you people?) but cool none the less.  Shouts out to Sandmoose and PhantoM especially.

PCGamer (http://www.pcgamer.com) has a very cool Anachronox preview up on their site.  Extremely good stuff.  Lots of good information, so check it out.

Mailing list for Daikatana news run by the Daikatana shrine (on WarZone).  just send a little email thingy to Majordomo@warzone.com and in the body type 'subscribe daikatana' (no quotes, all lowercase) and your set.  Neat huh?  (Note, due to confusion; this is a mailing list ran by and for people who are fans of Ion Storm and waiting for the game.  There is no real official sponsorship of the thing... although a few of us are on it seeing what you kids have to say...*grin*)

As far as Anachronox goes, still animating and skinning away, and texturing, and building and rebuilding and all of that.  Eidos came by for a little peek yesterday.  We're all moving on and doing some major leaps-and-bounds type stuff.  Very cool to be a part of this team, not to mention this company.

Jesus saves sinners... and redeems them for valuable prizes!

Laters for you.

Marv Albert: heh.

Well if you haven't noticed go over to the ol' WebPage (www.ionstorm.com) click on the 'Games' section and then see what a magnificent job Noel's done with that bad boy.  Very cool stuff.  The only link in there that works is Daikatana, but it is some sweetness to see.  (click on the two models at the top of two of the three heroes, and the chaingunner at the bottom... how's THAT for a skinned model?  Our skin artist rocks balls. Nuff said.)

Got to sit in on Tom's chat-o-rama on MSN the other night.  Very cool.  Extremely good questions from everyone out there (yes Noel... even the chocolate body lotion question... heh).  You guys rock too.

Still animating like a banshee... ran into snags here and there, but other than small tweaks everyones stuff is looking real nice here on Anachronox.  (Jeez.  "looking real nice"... Christ I sound like something out of Sling Blade all of a sudden... Deliverance maybe.   Gotta stop that.)
