And to think we were touting the addictiveness and fun of Worms 2 way back when...

That X-Files finale was something else.  Even helped to take the mind off of more painful stuff that has happened as of late.  A fantastic way to segue into the movie.  "Mulder's going rogue." Heheh

It's amazing how cathartic work can become when life really screws you over.  It can really take your mind off of the bullshit of life.  

Oh and one more thing.  This one goes out to all the people that try to tell me that software piracy is victimless and non-violent retalliation against the man... :)
