This is my plan and my plan alone.  Basically just my thoughts, rants, opinions, life, and sometime there's even actual information!  
Stay tuned dear viewer...

Small update on my plan from 2/3... got this from a friend of mine... just had to share it (thanks Toby!):

"Who told you to look at the
light?  You only do that during near-death experiences."

Hee.  (Although think that's actually 'Go towards the light'...)

Anyways, been working away and gotten a boatload of stuff done in the past two or four days.  Very cool indeed.  I think you guys are really gonna like this alot.  

One other thing (at least for now, may have more to say a little later, who knows):  do any of you X-Philes know what the subtitle of the Stephen King-written episode (this coming Sunday's) was going to be?  Evidently Fox axed it, because of it being some Spanish slang for sex or something, and also doubles as the doll's name in the episode (although the name is never spoken in the script from what reports say).  Just wondering, I'd get a kick to know what it actually is.

See you on the flipside.

Conversation with a friend:

Me: =+About to sneeze+=
Friend:  Look at the light!  Stare at the light!
Me: =+SNEEZE!+=
Friend: If you had stared at the light, you wouldn't have sneezed
Me:  No, I would've sneezed, but would have suffered such intense retina burns, I wouldn't remeber sneezing.

(Sometimes, one's friends need a little smackage upside the head, methinks.)

More later
