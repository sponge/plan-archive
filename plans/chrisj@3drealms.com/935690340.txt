I'm not sure how to react to the Ottawa Sun article.  I mean, to read it, how poorly it's written, the inaccuracies throughout it, the horrible excuse for journalism it is... I don't know whether to laugh uncontrollably or cry at the state of mainstream journalism.

The funny thing is that on sCary's messageboards someone who emailed the editor of this...ahem...newspaper posted the reply he received from the editor.  Basically the response was that the article was from a sister newspaper (in Toronto) and it was their intention to print a summary of it; checking the accuracy of the "facts" presented wasn't their job.  (no, unfortunately, I'm not kidding)  Er... hi.  Mr Editor, that WOULD be your job; well, yours and the editor of the paper from where the story originated.  

The term "editor" has never been more undeserved.

So the article itself uses a single EXTREMELY biased source and no follow-up to find out facts or an opposing view.  Real good reporting here kids.  This makes the Enquirer look like U.S News and World Report.  Probably one of the most disgusting bits of tripe ever to see newsprint.

How interesting.  It would seem the Ottawa Sun, in their infinite....er... wisdom pulled the article.  I wonder why that was?
