First off, Happy Birthday Tom Hall (yesterday) and all of that stuff.  His is by no means the first birthday here in the office, just the first one (at least that I've seen) that was awarded both cake AND ice cream.  Ah, the advantages of being the designer.

Secondly, we have an 'official' Lead Artist guy, and that would be Lee Perry.  So now, all of the general shit that the artists take will be directed full force to him, and then divided amongst the rest of us.  Unfortunately, now that Lee is officially 'The Man', me and the other 'oppressed brothas and sistas' on Team Anachronox will fight the power and the oppression that he represents.  Power to the People!!  

(Sorry... kinda been having fun catching all the Shaft movies, etc.  Great watching.  Really great with liberal amounts of alcoholic bliss trown in for good measure.)

Looks like FF7 hit the shelves today.  Should be cool to see it in action.  

Oh yeah one more thing...  if ANYone can tell me where/who this is from I will be duly impressed.  (Yes, I already know it... I want to know if you know it.)

"...Fracture my spine,
And swear that you're mine, 
As we dance to the Masochism Tango."

Laters for you.

Last night a friend of mine got the Mac Version of Quake (well, the free CompUSA disk, anyhoo).  I gotta say the guys at Lion (or is that "The Artisits Formerly Known as Lion"?) did a nice job on the port it looks like.  Seems to run pretty smooth even on a low end PowerPC Macintosh, which he has, although the resolution and detail levels both had to be cut to the lowest to get a really decent framerate... freak ought to get a faster computer... or maybe even a PC. (The horror!  The horror!)  He's been complaining a good long time about the lack of any good games for the Mac in a while.  Now I hope this will quell the griping, if only for a little bit.  (Oh yeah... as far as controls... the one button mouse thing COULD very well be a detriment... just a thought.)

Air Force One:  decent movie.. great acting.  Completely cheeseball ending.  What happened?  Did the writers just realize "hey... we have ABSOLUTELY no idea how to end this thing...um... let's use some totally crappy movie convention shit, and throw in a stunt that would snap a person's spine in 47 different places."  (Afterwards, I saw there was a novelization of this movie already (which movie doesn't have one?) but I figured the last chapter would consist solely of "Epilogue: Lots of visual crap that no one would believe, shot with all the grace of a water- buffalo in heat.  Good guys win."  If you can accept that go see it.  The acting is great.  It's the effects that... well... you know...

Anachronox:  Rocks.  And will rock.  For now check out Squishy's Anachronox Cantina [http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/8007/ (a nod to Sandmoose perhaps?), The Bricks [http://games.nextlevel.net/bricks/index.htm], and Anachronews [http://www.anachronews.com] (in no discernible order, of course.).  And no, I'm not plugging any one site or anything like that, but somehow, these guys get ahold of info on the game, and are pretty decently designed as well.  No free plugs here... er... until I get paid an 'advertising fee', of course.

"Booze.  It's what's for dinner."

Laters for you.
