I had to share this little poem...
==A Presidential Poem==

I got all excited, made a giant mess,
It was my misfortune, it landed on her dress.
Man I thought I was careful, and pointed far away,
But she caught a dressful of Flyin' D.N.A,
 
She was so damn playful, such a little tease,
I used to laugh at the rug burn, on her chubby knees.
She tried her best to escape it, but couldn't get away,
I bit my lip and fired, Flyin' D.N.A.,

I thought it was our secret, but she let it slip,
Monica went blabbin', right to Linda Tripp.
She taped it on her recorder, and she just pressed play,
And the world got an earful, of Flyin' D.N.A.,
 
When the dress gets tested, by the F.B.I.,
My only option is to just deny.
But before you impeach me, here's what's in store,
Your new El' Presedente', will be that putz Al Gore.

Thanks to the guilty party who passed it my way (you know who you are)...

Wow.  It's amazing what one can accomplish when one actually gets up at 7:00 in the AM, works out, and actually takes care o' bidness...

Just wanted to say farewell to Chris Day from the 3D Portal stuff, and good luck down at UT.  Do it for the Yad. ;)

Anyone out there use Rhino3d?  I keep hearing some interesting things about this tool, but was wondering what kind of reviews there were from people using it for real-time game-type stuff.  Any insight would be quite welcome.

Truly amazingly cool stuff going on around these parts, and on all fronts too.  Oh, and if you get a chance to check out this months PCGames, they have many really choice words about all of our stuff.  Tres cool.

Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
