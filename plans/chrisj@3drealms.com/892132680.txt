This is my plan and my plan alone.  Basically just my thoughts, rants, opinions, life, and sometime there's even actual information!

Okay, first off, on a lark, I checked out the new Information Society CD "Don't Be Afraid", mainly because I happened to catch sight of it mentioned on Jay Hosfelt's .plan, and I kinda trust his musical tastes (I need to get Emergency Broadcast Network, tho...).  Anyways, this is an excellent CD (Double actually.. one is a data cd type thingy).  Very Front242/Kraftwerk-y in places... only a couple of bad bits in the music, pretty cool.  

(Okay, I promise... no more CD stuff in here.  Too many people do it already, and I don't know if anyone is all THAT worried about musical tastes, as long as we kick ass on the games... right?)

Things are looking remarkably good on some of the stuff here...  Mike's got some great stuff going on with his anim's... as do I (said with all due modesty), and Brian's doing some great work as well...

Oh, and before I sign off, to the person who sent me an email, asking how I could "in good consciense [sic] help in the production of such a politically incorrect game" as Duke Forever, I answer thusly:

1) It's a game...

2)  Political correctness is way overrated, and should be used only by politicians (why else is it called 'political' correctness?), and then only in small doses.  I'm as much against racism, sexism, and other -isms as humanly possible, but stratifying a class of products to meet the various sensitivities of everyone out there makes the products ultimately stagnant, humorless, and a bore.  

Also, I see political correctness as being much more divisive than equalizing.  Instead of everyone being fellow countrymen, or whatever, it tries to reclassify as sects within the larger grouping of countrymen.  And this makes differences far more visible than anything I can imagine, rendering anything resembling a color/gender/class-blind society completely unattainable.  I know plenty of "people of color (typed while stifling a gag reflex)" that do not refer to themselves with "PC" labels, and actually threaten me with bodily harm if I do it. :)  Hell, I'd have to be Anglo-Germanic-American... and that ain't happening. (Plus it makes it a real bitch to know who to root for during War documentaries.  See?  That's a joke. Poked at myself.  Deal with it.)

3)  It amazes me that people who are militant about getting other people to compromise to fit _their_ oh-so-righteous (and extremely narrow) view of the world, are so unwilling to look at the flipside of the coin and do the same for other people/views.  I have little patience for hypocrites (having worked under them in many guises before coming here), and hopefully this retort will be the last I will feel I need to deal with them for quite a while.

/rant off

Oh yeah... Bunso... the Rev rocks... :)

Alright.  Off the bat, this has nothing to do with the game, or anything else for that matter...

I'm listening to the MC 900 Foot Jesus CD "Hell with the Lid Off", and was wondering if anyone who knows the song 'Born With Monkey Asses' knows who the lady who is ranting in the song, where she is, and what the situation is.  My own personal opinion is it's a patient at an asylum or something (because she's spouting off some odd-ass crap), but I may be wrong.  If anyone can tell me for sure what this is, I'd love to know.

Thanks.

Real news later.  Maybe.  Who knows.

Go away now. :)
