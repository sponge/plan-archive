First: congratulation to the ION Storm Four-man Quake Bobsled Relay Squad (or whatever it is called) that's going to QuakeCon (Voin, Shadow, Squirrel, Indigo)... everyone else, get some gauze to help your soon-to-be-cracked squirrels.

Not go off on a rant here...

Have been hard-core car shopping as of late, and ran into a bit of a problem...

I'm a big guy.  I stand 6'6" tall.  I have extremely broad shoulders.  Huge freaking frame.  Take a look at my picture on the Ion Storm home page.  See that big-ass melon of a head?  Add a body that is proportionate to it, and you get the picture.  

What is it about car companies that make them say, "Hey.  Any car that's fun to drive and/or gets good gas mileage requires an individual to be short.  (no offense to the short poeple with fun or economical cars... some of whom are my bosses *insert smart-assed grin here*) Noooo... I'm stuck driving a large boat (fine for water skiing, not for driving), an SUV (not bad until you figure how far from work I live, and the gas mileage that they get), or a truck (er... no).  A couple of alternatives, but nothing that just creams my twinkie, if you get what I'm getting at.

Think I'll start a class-action suit... something about body-frame-size-discrimination or something lawyers would love to spout off... should be fun.  Heh.

Speaking of class-action suits... the one du jour is Stewardesses vs. the Tobacco industry.  Okay.  The tobacco industry is pretty lousy on the whole, but what next?  Midget bowlers v/ the tobacco industry.  Ostrich farmers v. Tobacco industry.  Geez.  And people wonder why the legal system is so backlogged.

Final note:  Brian Hook's rant is right.  Whiny high-schoolers from suburbia: shut up.  When you pay income tax, have to deal wit house payments, and life is more than why-oh-why did Soundgarden break up and what's on Buffy the Vampire Slayer this week, then you can bitch to me.  Until then...

Not much in the way of news, so...

Public Service Announcement Dept.: Zep's has moved!  Just got a message from him on ICQ that he moved, so...

Eye on Ion's new page address is: http://www.elitegames/com/ion/

Let's just hope that's the end of his moving for a while... I'm sick of seeing his ugly mug in a Ryder van all the time... :)

Back From E3, Now The Fun Begins Dept.:  E3 went well.  (Wish I hgad gone... *insert sigh here*) Lots of good reviews even with an early version as what we showed for DaiKatana.  We now know what is expected, how to surpass it, and are ready to kick some major ass.  It5 can happen; it will happen.  Thanks to the people who have mailed in some suggestions etc etc etc, I look forward to hearing from everyone who wnats to drop a line, and as always, I'll TRY to drop you a line right back.  Rest assured, the final product will open your eyes, your mind, and most importantly, will steer the genre into the direction it needs to head-- substance.  

Especially impressed with the word on the other quake-Engine games out there... especially Half-life.  Wow!  The word on the street (as well as from the mouths of reviewers who I personally know) really liked this.  The Sierra .MOV with the little snippets of Half-Life in it were nice too.  Maybe more room is to be made at the table...

This one's short but sweet... Peter/Voin is threatening to try and destroy us all... time to slap him down (if possible).  

Congrats to Thresh on his fine new automobile also.  Saw the demo of the game (two words: download it.), and it is one helluva impressive piece of play... wish I knew what he was doing... still figuring it out.  Yow.

Though I Walk Through the Valley of E3 Dept.:  Just got off of an interesting little hour or so of IRC on #ionstorm on EFNet, where me and the Mad Somoan (and to a lesser degree, Voin and Seb) were accosted by a throng of ravenous DaiKatana-wanters... hopefully we answered what we could, should be able to give a little more info after the big 4 day weekend party known as E3.  

E3 readiness Dept.:  Burning the cd now.  Should be ready for everyone to peruse and looks good.  I'm not going to let an ego or condescending remarks get in the way of anything: see for yourself, if you're going of course.  And personally I look forward to hearing words of wisdom and encouragement from you when you do... let me know what you think, in general, or specifically.  (My specific piece in the demo is the weapon models, both held and in the game--not the skins, if you're wondering)  Note: we're already tweaking and changing some things, so we may be ahead of you on your suggestions, but keep em coming.  If I can, I'll try and answer whoever writes me... it may take time, but I'll do my best...

Note to PhantoM (Deutschlander): Yes I know I misspelled them... I got lazy.  If it happens again, then I was lazy again... what can I say? :)

Looks like I'm not going to E3... no one ponied up the cash for me (not like I really expected it, but a guy can dream can't he?)... but I (and practically the whole crew I think) will be at QuakeCon 97 with bells on.  (They'll be the last thing you hear before you go gib... or before you gib me (I ain't THAT great...yet.) 

Welp that's about it.  Gonna go play a DM against the guys... letting loose the steam as it were...

Oh, and for those of you who want to know, when Voin(Peter) saw Mikiko in the game for the first time at my computer, his exact words were, "Dude... she's HOT dude!"  (I think he needs out more often...)

So until next time kids...
