Actually I'm getting a bigger kick out of SiN deathmatch than I originally thought I would.  Scaling the fences and such is a nice touch.  First time I sqaw someone do that, I thought they found a really interesting way to jump.  Very cool idea.  Congrats on getting the demo out.

I suddenly feel really good about Duke.

Got a chance to checkout some interesting goings-on at the CPL thingy off and on, around work and such.  Didn't quite have the same feel as QuakeCon 97 did though.  Different vibe or something.  'Twas extremely cool being able to catch some of the folks I met at E3 again, and show them around with what little time (and in some case, cooperation) I had, but what we were able to do was pretty cool.  May have to do it on your turf sometime guys... but when I do I get to bitch about what a cesspool of almost-humanity your town is then.  (Oh Jason: still didn't get any Guinness shoved down my gullet.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it! :)

Oh... Blue... I still owe you that Macanudo.

Also finally got to meet the creative mind behind TargetQuake, Avatar.  Cool guy.  Good luck at the art school.  Hope to see more stuff for you and know your getting paid for it someday. :)  (It is extremely cool.  If you have Quake still installed, drop by avatar.telefragged.com and check it out... other stuff he has there is quite good as well).

Speaking of the CPL thingy, I got quite a few mails concerning my use of Lightwave... specifically in relation to a seminar of sorts put on by Paul Steed at the CPL thingy, in which he claimed Lightwave "sucks".  I have no problem with his opinion on this or much of anything else quite frankly, I just wanted to point out in one fell swoop that Lightwave seems to do the job just fine here (and evidently through all of ION Storm as well)... good enough to get rave mentions on the art that I and everyone else had done prior to E3.  I could go on for hours saying how I think Max sucks, or 3DS4 sucks, or whatever if I wanted to (for the record 3DS4 isn't bad, I abhor Max), and I doubt that would matter either.  Chaos is absolutely enamored with Softimage from what I understand, which I can't pass judgement on because I never tried it.  And everyone of us gets the job done.  Opinions vary between people.  In the long run it isn't the tool it's the artist.  Find what you like and use it.  If you can see it and how to do it, the tool is just a way of getting there.

Anyone who tells you any one package sucks, is just telling you it sucks for them and their style.  Either that, or they've got an endorsement deal. ;)

(And no... the preceding is not meant as a slam towards anyone, lest someone get an idea and try to form a little war out of something that isn't)

Mmmmmmm..... Steak.....

God.  Sometimes song lyrics CAN describe development... ;)

Interesting.

An anagram for "Monica Lewinsky" is 'Insane Milky Cow'.

Kinda says it all.
