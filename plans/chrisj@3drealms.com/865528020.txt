Hokay Dokay... Looks like it's time to make the plan a tiny bit more informative (I know I know... "Why start now?" ask the throngs of those seeking information, well, because I'm tired and have no real insane-or even loosely eccentric-thoughts within my little brainpan... so...)

News From Work Dept.:  Finally saw what Voin was talking about.  The Crossbow is very cool indeed when used in combat.  Like seeing guys roaming about looking like pin-cushions.  And when they gib, can you imagine pieces of the enemy, already on sticks just ripe for barbecue?  Yum!  Can't help thinking what Quake would have been like with this .  Think about it...

Seems like the work we're getting done increases exponentially.  E3 Weapons models are done (except for some mild tweaking if need be).  Some of the carried models are extremely sweet.  The animated creatures are just beautiful too. And Will's music... GAWD!  I've never been this impressed with a working team in my life... seriously.  This game is gonna rock... not only at E3, but massively as a final product too... 

Personal Bitch and Moan Dept.:  Not really a bitch or moan, but, has anyone else noticed that a lot of the architecture in Hexen II seems to be awfully flat/boxy?  I mean don't get me wrong, I think the game is absolutely beautiful, but I hope that the screenshots we've seen that show squared columns in the Roman-style architecture get changed to something more rounded... and that the doorways get more of an arched shape in some areas as well.. it kinda detracts from some of the other beautiful looking scenery in that game... but then again, that's just a personal opinion...

Welp, got back from my 3 day vacation stuff... everything was taken care of, and I'm glad to say I was neither killed, nor did I do it.  (Confused yet?  Good. Now you know how I feel all the time...)

News At Work Dept.:  Well, been doing dome more work on the weapon models.  Got some help in getting them done in time for everything too.  Thank GOD for Voin's help... thought I was gonna be buried in them all alone! :)  Now I'm going back and adding carried versions of the weapons (helps keep the poly count low AND adds details to the carried weapons, so there's more depth than just texture mapping alone...

Free Plug Dept.:  NewTek!  Lightwave! A God-send!

Gotta Learn Something New Dept.:  Gotta learn HTML stuph... or else download a cheap-ass editor... either way this text stuff has to go!

Special Thanks to:  all the people who wished me birthday greets and gifts (especially my girlfriend... the Gargoyles are just too cool and on my desk!)

Personal Note Dept.:  

To John Romero:  be nice to the Keyboards and computers... quit bashing them... there's probably some group out there that will turn you in for peripheral abuse...

To John Romero, Pt. II:  already know about the random respawn thing... came back from my trip, my car had respawned randomly away from where I left it... then it respawned again (attached to a tow truck) in front of my house, and the bastards...er...kind gentlemen who "found" it respawned in a 10'x10' cell.  Neat huh?
