"Yea verily... and the artist doth come in early to worketh on his animationseths... and it is good..."

Been bopping around for a little while tweaking some on the model/anims I've been working on.  Figure when these are done it'll be almost and about done.  Couple of geometry changes that I hadn't noticed but some other quick-eyed people (i.e. who hadn't been satring at it constantly for a while) noticed.  So that looks good to go.

It never ceases to amaze me how the very small changes can help change something so drastically, and ultimately for the better.

Checked out the Mysteries of the Sith demo.  Very cool.  Pretty fun... methinks the AI needs to be tweaked a tad though... nothing worse than leaping into a fray between incoming heathen Stormtroopers and your own rebel forces (yes, they fight alongside you... tres cool) and finding yourself wailing like a banshee, dying because one of your comrades decided shooting you was an acceptable way to get to them.  Friendly fire isn't. 

Music I'm listening to:  Whatever Brian's been playing.

Music Brian's playing:  my CDs... (um... does anyone else find this odd?)

See you on the Dark Side

ARRRGH!!

You know, there is nothing more upsetting than finishing up a lot of work and finding one little piece of data somewhere has gotten corrupted somewhere along the line, and yet going through the various stages multiple times, everything looks normal.  God... what a pisser.  Time to go back and yell "do over" I guess.  But I won't scream, not just yet...

Anyways wanted to thank everyone who let me know what the subttle to the XFiles episode this sunday was.  (Side Note: Yeah, you're probably some sort of a celebrity, like it or not. :)

Back to the "do over"...
