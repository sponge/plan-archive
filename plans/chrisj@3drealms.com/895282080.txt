This is my plan and my plan alone.  Basically just my thoughts, rants, opinions, life, and sometime there's even actual information!

Congratulations Deanna!

Can't wait to see the stuff you put out over at dna.  Be good to see stories and art you'll be able to put out with full use of your formidable talents.

Good luck.  We'll get together soon, hopefully.

This way to the egress.

Ah, May 5th.  Cinco de Mayo.  A time where we can justify drinking that imported Mexican beer (Bohrmia... Negro Modelo...Mmmmmm) and those Top Shelf Margaritas until we're massively blithering idiots, because dammit, we're celebrating.  True, most people have no idea exactly WHAT they're celebrating, but what the hell.  Drink enough, you don't care, and you can make up your own celebratory reasons/toasts.

Stole this link from Redwood (credit where credit's due and all):

It's an ad for Divx that'll be hitting magazines soon.  Kind of a pantload full of crap actually.  Lot of information convieniently left off.  Oh and Redwood:  personally, my favorite quote is the tagline: "You've reached the point of no return."  How true is that?  (Divx do suck, don't it?)

And since it's May 5th, it's also 22 days to E3.  Thank God.  Also 22 days to my 26th birthday.  I'm getting old.  Anyways come to E3.  Say hi.  Bring gifts. ;)

The difference between praise, and simply sucking up to a person/company/entity are huge and diverse.  And the latter is annoying as hell.
