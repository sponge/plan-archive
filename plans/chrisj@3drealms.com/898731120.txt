Mmmmm.  Overly sarcastic, cynical gaming news with no graphics or redeeming social value.  Fun stuff.

>>Link removed<<

Sorry, had to remove it as some people decided I was the one that wrote the freaking page, simply because I'm overly sarcastic by nature.  Bloody hell.  If you want the link email me and I'll be happy to give it to you.  But I'd hate to be possibly blamed at any turn for hurting the sensibilities of some overly sensitive self-absorbed people, even if I'm just providing a freaking web address, so the address is removed from the plan.  Jeez.

And for the record, I don't consider myself "overworked" at all.  I actually kinda enjoy this gig. ;)

Screw it.  Here it is.  Last time I bow down to the man.

This is ALWAYS a good thing to read coming back from E3: "3D Realms, in this donkey boy of love's opinion, is the best gaming company going." This is from Meccaworld's day three wrap-up.  (And yeah I was going to leave out the donkey-boy of love part, but damn that's an entertaining euphemism... ;)  The coolest thing is that reviews for Duke, Prey and Max Payne have ALL been that positive.  Very cool indeed.  Gratifying as hell to say the least.

E3 was a wierd beast.  Huge, flashy, loud, and on many occasions, drunken. ;)  But in all of it, there was nothing on the floor that just utterly kicked me in the head and blew me away.  Not to say that things weren't good, because there were MANY things that looked really really nice... Heca...er...Heretic II, Half-life, Parasite Eve, Shogo, Get Medieval, Sin, Warzone 2100, ad nauseum, looked really nice, and makes it to where the upcoming year will definitely be a good one for game playing (not to mention three games called Duke Forever, Prey, and Max Payne. ;).  But there wasn't than end-all-be-all out of nowhere game that just utterly destroyed my synapses and was THE game that I saw.  That was kinda disappointing to me, because you almost always hear of one that does that.

But then, I'm leaving our booth out of the running. *grins*

Seriously it was a very cool time.  One of those things everyone should do once in their lifetime.  Maybe twice.  Lots to see, great stuff to play, great people to talk to.

On that last point, here's a nice "hullo" to all of those I knew and finally met.  It was very cool indeed.  So in no really particular order:  Greets to Eric Biessman, Bob Love(both Raven), Billy "Wicked" Wilson (Voodoo Extreme.. what a guy...he even reviewed me ;), Lithium (3DPortal, et al), loonyboi(Raving Guiness flunky), Joost (GameSpy), Fargo, Bastard(Both PlanetQuake), Aurora and Bobbi (Clan PMS/GameGirlz), Blue(Duh), Paul Butterfield (Monolith), Brad Wernicke (#d Portal), Zep (Duke Troop...um... StormTroopers ;), All the guys I talked to From Ion (Pete, Andy, Andrew, William, John, Bryan, etc etc etc), OneThumb and Wieder (Ritual), Mike and Terry (g.o.d.), the list continues ad infinitum.  Very cool to meet up with you people out there.  Very cool stuff all around.  Definitely look forward to keeping in touch with everyone.  Definitely had a good time.

And yeah, FooFighters at the SegaSoft party was a nice touch.

P.S.  Made it out alive without a taste of Guinness.  There is a God.  ;)

P.P.S.  And with the reviews that good, imagine what they would have been like with the cool shtuff we have that we didn't add in for E3... ;)

"It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it..." 

My GOD, no one should have to be up this early on their birthday. :)

Anyways, it looks like we're about ready to roll.  The only thing to worry about now is making sure we don't get one of those 737s with the "fun wiring," and we're all set.

Look forward to meeting people at E3.  Have a lot of people to meet, things to see, drinks to partake, and generally have a good time.  Indentured servitude only works for so long. ;)

See you in Atlanta.

"There's a girl with a crown and a scepter, who's on WLSD..."

Well, looks like I've nothing to fear.  Many different bartenders types and such have either told me not to worry, or have offered me a free drink or two.  Wow.  

The only unfortunate side-effect is that WAS going to save me from having to partake of (ugh) Guiness, that someone is forcing down my throat.  If you haven't noticed, it ain't my fave.  Guiness: The Beer That Eats Like A Meal (tm).  Ah well.  Maybe I won't notice it too much in light of everything else.  

But like a good soldier I WILL partake, so now worries on that, okay? (And you know who you are... :)

Oh Christ.  Heard and started thinking about Kiwi's driver's license problems, and started thinking about it, and well crap, I might have a problem during E3 as well.  You see my 26th birthday is on the 27th, meaning that my license expires while I am in Atlanta.  Just freaking wonderful.  Man I really hope they don't give me any grief over it, because I haven't had a good let-you-hair-down-or-shave-it-all-off time in a LOOONG time, and I really planeed on attempting to catch up whilst in Atlanta.  Don't make me angry... you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.   (So if you're there, bring me presents to help appease me. ;)

Went and saw that Godzilla flick today, finally.  I really didn't see the big deal against it.  I mean yeah, okay, the dialogue is cheese.  The plot, what there was, was cheese.   But this is (and read carefully) A GODZILLA MOVIE.  Plot and anything that really resembles realism gets shot down just by that.  Add to that that it IS a Roland Emmerich movie (good guy, but ID4, etc taints him a tad) and you know it's going to be kinda heavy handed.  This isn't a change your life type of flick.  It's a shut-off-the-brain-and-enjoy-the-ride type of flick.  View it that way, and you'll have a good time.

Favorite after movie quote: "So what were the French Secret Service doing there exactly?  Where they there to tell everyone exactly when was the right time to surrender? 'Ze zituation is hopeless.  We must zurrender and align ourzelves with ze lizard.  Pass the bagettes.' "

One problem I had was some of the CGI stuff wasnt' quite right.  Mostly stuff I noticed and picked up on, and it didn't seem too terribly bad, so it was my nit-picking I guess.

What was the deal with giving half of the cast to Simpson's cast members?  I mean they did a good job and all, but sheesh.  Did they sign a contract with Matt Groening to get time off or something?  

Who knew New York cabs could go through so damn much and still be so drivable??  Now THAT'S a GM ad.

Finally:  one note to the writers:  Um the Siskel and Ebert jokes wore thin in like 5 minutes.  Thanks for beating us over the head with it, and making sure we all got the joke by doing the thumbs up/thumbs down at the end.  Really.  It made it oh so much more enjoyable.  Bleagh.  :/

(But hey, after that I still enjoyed it...  but then again I only paid matinee price too...)

See you at E3.  Stop by, say hi.

And to think we were touting the addictiveness and fun of Worms 2 way back when...

That X-Files finale was something else.  Even helped to take the mind off of more painful stuff that has happened as of late.  A fantastic way to segue into the movie.  "Mulder's going rogue." Heheh

It's amazing how cathartic work can become when life really screws you over.  It can really take your mind off of the bullshit of life.  

Oh and one more thing.  This one goes out to all the people that try to tell me that software piracy is victimless and non-violent retalliation against the man... :)
