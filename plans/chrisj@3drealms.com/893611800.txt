This is my plan and my plan alone.  Basically just my thoughts, rants, opinions, life, and sometime there's even actual information!

"Sunday, bloody sunday..."

Wow.  What a weekend.  Been in here today since about 11:00 this morning.  The plus side of this is being able to get the work done, put in a CD (and listen to it without damn headphones, if only until someone else comes in) and focus only on what I'm doing.

The downside is I just can't focus.  *Sigh*

Spent some time last night watching various movies, getting some ideas for animations and such... I don't know, maybe it's just me, but some of my stuff doesn't neccesarily  start looking the same as the other... it just *Feels* the same.  Don't know if anyone else has ever had that feeling.  Could be the deep psychosis drifting in again.

Anyways, got some good ideas from doing that.  The downside is that the implementation is slow-going (not me, there's some VERY GOOD reasons for it to happen... read into that what you will I guess; I know you will anyways. :)  (this stuff sticks with me I guess... I realized last night that one of the animations I did resembled almost EXACTLY a scene from one of the movies I watched.  And the animation was done roughly 2 weeks before yesterday's movie-fest, and about 6 months since I had seen the damn movie.)

I just realized what part of the problem is:  the Grosse Point Blank soundtrack I'm listnening to.  It's just too damn good (mostly) and kinda takes over my train of thought.  Ah well... I always knew that havng such a short attention span could be my Achilles heel.

I know that I'm really not relating anything of great import here, just kind of spouting off.  Sorry.  You no like, you no read.

Bah.  Just had another flash of something that might work.  Wish me luck.  

One last note, Except for very small moments in which I allow myself out of my cocoon, I'll probably seal myself from the outside world for a while.  Feel free to email me, but if it takes a little while to get a response from my usually (to the point of being anal) quick-to-reply self, this is the reason.  

E3.  Great show.  Big pain. :)

It's the little bits of humor that are most gratifying... especially when they happen like this...
