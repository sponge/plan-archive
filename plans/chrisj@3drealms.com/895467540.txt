This is my plan and my plan alone.  Basically just my thoughts, rants, opinions, life, and sometime there's even actual information!

It should be known that Zep talks a whole helluva lot of smack, with little or nothing to back it up.  I have never been anyone's basstard son, although it has been rumored that I can be a real bastard sometimes.  I'm not even red-headed as he would like some to believe.

It's too bad that he's just a short little hack who gives new meaning to the term "wasting bandwidth". :)

(And yes the preceeding was a joke.  Just a little friendly rub against someone who decided to start it first. ;)

And to think we were touting the addictiveness and fun of Worms 2 way back when...

That X-Files finale was something else.  Even helped to take the mind off of more painful stuff that has happened as of late.  A fantastic way to segue into the movie.  "Mulder's going rogue." Heheh

It's amazing how cathartic work can become when life really screws you over.  It can really take your mind off of the bullshit of life.  

Oh and one more thing.  This one goes out to all the people that try to tell me that software piracy is victimless and non-violent retalliation against the man... :)
