Plan:
These are my personal views! They do not express the views of Rogue
 Entertainment or any associates of Rogue Entertainment, family,
 friends or pets. I will not shag sheep during meetings and no 
shaving of the chickens during lunch breaks! I think that about 
covers all the bases.


October 22, 1999:

Well, happy anniversary to me (or at least to this .plan file).As of today,
it's been 1 year exactly since I last updated this thing. Not like I have
anything to say that will alter anyone's reality, but what the hell...So,
we're steadily working on Alice (can't really talk about that..) and things
are moving along. Still waiting for this end of the world thing...whenever
it's supposed to show up. And overall, disappointed that no one has cloned
a hairless explosive chinchilla...not that it'd be of any real scientific
use, but think about this...Chinchilla wars...cloned Chinchillas being 
loaded into catapualts and hurled across acres and acres of land to come 
down and smite  your enemies on their heads with a mighty "BoooooooooooM!!"  
OR have the paratrooper model, exploding chinchilla death from above, 
bio-chemical chinchillas night landings...etc..etc..etc
If nothing else, use them to stalk and eliminate your favorite celebrities 
(or least favorite if your into that)...Walk up behind...oh for the sake 
of arguement...Bob Barker...animals rights activist extrordinaire...and then
"smack,bam, dead!!", then there would be one less game show host in the world!
I personally think if you take a say a pigeon (for the sky), lemmings (for the
ground assualt), and platapus (for the naval end of a battle)...these could
be delivery systems........................but enough of this global 
domination, I guess I'll update this thing again in a year..........
