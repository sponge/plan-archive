I was extremely saddened to read about the recent death of Jim Nitchals, one of the creators of the Starpath Supercharger for the Atari 2600.  

My mom was a mere accounting clerk at Arcadia/Starpath back in those days when I was able to visit a lot during the summer.  Besides getting my own Starpath, some t-shirts, and a wad of games (my favorites were Dragonstomper! and Escape from the Mindmaster), I received something far more valuable -- inspiration. Being around a bunch of hyperkinetic game developers at that age surely rubbed off, because more than anything I wanted to learn how to make games.  

And while I don't remember Jim or "Doc" Brown by face, the impact of meeting them and their contribution to the Atari 2600 will never be forgotten.
