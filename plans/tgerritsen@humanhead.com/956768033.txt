Life around here is hectic as we get ready for E3.  Both Rune and Blair Witch are looking hotter every day.  To me this is the second best part of game development (the best part is actually seeing your game on the store shelf).  Each day the vision you've held for so long becomes more and more complete.  The original vision also changes, and you begin to see possibilities that you never thought of while the concept was still in your head, or on a piece of paper.  

Every day I see something truly amazing that makes both of these games that much more incredible.  This is the part of development that makes all of the late nights worth while.  Now it's on to LA.  

See you there!
