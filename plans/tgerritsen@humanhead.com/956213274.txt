No big news, but I wanted to take a moment to state publicly that if any of you caught the Daily Radar interview between me and John Coghlan, I found it to be horribly unprofessional.  Mr Coghlan asked me questions via the phone, and didn't bother to spell check, fact check, or get back to me to clarify statements.  Furthermore, he paraphrases statements I made and reprints them as direct quotes.  It is full of spelling errors, factual errors and incomplete sentences.  

I want to clarify that there are several statements he prints as direct quotes that are totally incorrect.  First off, let me state to Epic that of course I am absolutely aware that not only are their enemies ai based, but they have one of the best shooter ai's in the industry.  What I actually told Mr. Coghlan was that our game is melee based, meaning that we have lots of melee, or man-to-man weapons.  Because of this, we had to alter the UT ai as it is 'obviously not melee based.'  There's a big difference between that and what Mr. Coghlan paraphrased as, "we've added our own AI enhancements since the enemies are all computer AI based and obviously UT wasn't."  

In addition, there are just places where he changed what I said to make him seem like a hip, savvy interviewer and ended up misrepresenting critical details of our game.  I've written Daily Radar and asked them to do an edit pass on the story and fix the most glaring errors.  Hopefully they will do so.

Sorry to rant, but it really bugs me when a shoddy job of interviewing makes Human Head or our game look bad.
