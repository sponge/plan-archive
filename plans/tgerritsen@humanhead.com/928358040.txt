Hey everyone.  Let me start off with a big thanks to everyone who came to see us at E3.  
It was great to see the terrific reaction to our admittedly early technical demo.

E3 was a great show for us, and the press so far has been great, too.  Everyone seemed to 
understand where we were coming from and where we want to go.  At ECTS we plan to really 
wow people with our content, so check us out there, too!

As we look into the future we are exploring plans for widening the game experience by 
possibly starting a line of toys, rpg's and other materials based on the Rune universe.  
The game's compelling creatures are tailor made for toys, and the early response we've 
been getting is exciting.  I will post more when I have something concrete to relate.  

Keep your fingers crossed.
