I want to say a quick congrats to the team at Third Law for getting their first game, KISS Psycho Circus wrapped up and a demo on the net.  They showed me a demo back at E3 and I hope the game does well for them.

I also wanted to let anyone who is attending MacWorld know that we will be showing off Rune at MacWorld later this week in New York.  Westlake has been doing a fantastic job on getting the Mac version of the game up and running.  The game looks awesome, with visuals looking great in RAVE and on VooDoo cards.  I've been playing it on our own iMac Special Edition and it looks awesome.  At the show we'll be running it on a G4 over at 3Dfx and it should scream on the VooDoo 5500's they'll have waiting for us.  Yes, this means you'll get to see Rune in Full Screen Anti-Aliasing (assuming no hiccups in installation on the machines at the show).  

Also, next month, we plan on showing the game in a much beefier public demonstration at GenCon in Milwaukee.  If you want to see Rune in an alpha state (the Mac demo will still be pre-alpha) come by and check us out at the GOD booth.

Also check out the free RPG demo rules from our friends at Atlas Games.  They are finishing up the Rune RPG and will have the demo rules at the show to give out at their booth.
