I would like to thank Daily Radar for being so fast to remove the interview with Mr. Coghlan.  The editors over there apologized for letting the interview that they posted slip through in the shape it was in.  They moved quickly to fix the problem and I thank them for it.  

As for Daily Radar, I want to apologize to them for any comments people made on the internet about them.  It was not fair of certain competitors to their site to use my plan file to snipe against Daily Radar and their staff.  I feel strongly that Daily Radar is an important source of information on the gaming industry and games in general. My comments were directed at Mr. Coghlan's interview only, and not Daily Radar.
