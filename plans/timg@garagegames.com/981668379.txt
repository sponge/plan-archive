Now that the DNS is pointing to our new server, the finger deamon should be accessible. So I'll make a short update...

(For those of you just tuning in, we are now in episode 4: "The Startup", where Rick Overman and I leave Dynamix and start up a new company with Jeff Tunnell called GarageGames.  Thus far, we've been mainly working on the web site, trying to flesh out the main features.)

More work on the web site, mostly some minor fixes and features.  The site is getting there :) It still needs work of course, but I think we're happy with the way it's coming along. The big activity right now is building some new pages for a press release: a FAQ, screenshots, feature list, etc.  After that's done, I expect I'll be spending more time on the V12 engine. I'll post more details on that after the press release.

CGDC is also coming up fast and we're starting to schedule that out. It should be fun.  Rick, Jeff and I are planning to drive down, about a 9 hour drive, which probably won't be fun. Though... I remember some long school trips where we sang "99 bottles of beer on the wall", so who knows?

For those of you interested in what we're up to, the site is www.garagegames.com.  There is also a recent interview with the three of us on Planet Starsiege:
