7.23.99

It's good to be back.  1.6 is out, and OpenGL seems to
be working better.  Several problems were introduced
into 1.6, we'll get to those asap, but there's nothing
like receiving 5 cases of Mirror Pond Ale to brighten
up your day :) I'd like to thank Diane Lee and Wasif
Azmat for sending in the care package. The team is very
grateful :)  The beer stack is on the web cam right now
(7.23) and we'll post some pictures on our website :)

I also wanted to thank Qui9 and Dr. Jeep for their
earlier donations. (Can't remember if I thanked them
personally)

Thanks! Woohoo!
