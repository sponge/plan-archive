Well, after posting in my last plan about starting to feel better, I got worst.  I was sick for a few more days with the flu (fever, coughing, etc.), and once I started recovering from that I pulled a muscle in my lower back (on Wed).  Now I can hardly move and I can't sit at the computer for more than a few minutes at a time.  These past few weeks have not been very productive.  Hopefully by Monday I should be feeling well enough to catch up on the forums and resume working on the v12.  Rick should be back tomorrow, it will be good to have him back in town :)
