Project: Starsiege TRIBES

1.24.00

Let's see. Recent activity...

- Finished all the client side player prediction.

- Added support for setting player animations from
script functions on the server. This is used to play
death animations, celebrations etc.

- Added in all the damage state and auto-repair code
for all gamebase objects. You can now damage any
gamebase objects including players and static shapes.
It's also tied in with ClarkF's decal animation so you
see the damage on the object (similar to TRIBES 1).

- The player can now be killed (and repaired, etc.)

- Added the Linear Projectile class (server and client
prediction code). So now you can run around and shoot
other players :)

- Added all the basic inventory scripting. Can pick up,
use and throw items, weapons, etc. There's more work to
do here, but now that the structure is in place,
someone else will probably flush it out.

Current activities...

Started on the wheeled vehicles last week.  I've been
re-arranging and updating the rigid body code I wrote
earlier, getting it all into the networking and
rendering framework.

Also been working on the networking article Mark
Frohnmayer and I are presenting at CGDC.  Should wrap
that up this week.
