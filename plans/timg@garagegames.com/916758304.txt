Kingpin:

Things are looking great! We've pretty much finalized all the engine changes, so that from now the artists can go ballistic and not have to worry about back-tracking as a result of improvements or fixes. The lighting system is working great, model's are lit from real light-sources, and there is an insignificant CPU hit (nevertheless, it can be disabled).

We got the new menu in a few days ago, so it's starting to show signs that we're on the final stretch. The fighting sequences are great, VERY tough, but not impossible. The new effects are starting to pop-up to give that "unique" look and feel to the game. This is still a 1st-person shooter, so you know basically what to expect, but there are many surprises in there that haven't been mentioned, so stay tuned.

Cricket:

My god, the Poms seem to have found a player or two. To all you pommies out there who've stopped following the cricket, you'd better check in again. Things are looking up for you.

Cool:

If you have a CD burner and are tired of spending 60+ mins installing Win95/NT, you MUST get a copy of <a href="http://www.ghostsoft.com/">Ghost</a>. My main drive was gaining more and more bad sectors by the day, so fearing a total failure, I grabbed a copy of this program, and having a spare HD lying around, did a complete drive copy within 10 minutes. I then exchanged the new drive with the bad one, and presto!

This program can also be used to store an "image" of a fresh install, which you can restore within a few minutes, which saves you the much longer task of re-installing the OS.

Extra Cool:

NBA Live 99.
