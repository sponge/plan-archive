3.2.99

Patch 1.3 is out. Dave Moore posts an update on OpenGL
in his plan. We've received a lot of feedback over the
last few days :) Some of which has has led to
significant improvements in the performance of our
driver. OpenGL is starting to look much better.  Soon
as Dave get's it all sorted out, we'll release a 1.3.x
beta for more feedback.

We are starting to QA our tool patch today, this will
probably be included in one of the upcoming betas as
well. Eventually there will be a Tribes 1.4 release,
though I don't see any major features being added at
this point. There are a lot of ideas bouncing around
for TRIBES, but after 1.4 we'll have to see how many of
those we want to implement. At some point we'll move into
more of a support role, fixing and addressing issues
as they occur, but mainly shifting our focus on to the
next TRIBES product.

Some of the other issues still being thought about:

	- Australian master server
	- Expanding our dedicated server base
	- Dedicated server stability
	- Scripting/Mod documentation
	- Better support for mod writers
	- Better support for dedicated server operators
	- Linux port
	- Patch/Update process improvements
	- A number of improvements to the web site

A lot of it comes down to better community support.
Comments? Feedback? I can't always answer every email
that comes in, but ideas are always welcome.
