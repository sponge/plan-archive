Well, back from Rick's wedding. That went pretty well :) Rick is now off to one of the Hawaiian islands on his honeymoon and won't be back for a few weeks.  So it's just Jeff and I to man the fort. I got back Tuesday, but haven't been feeling well. Spent most of yesterday in bed, but I'm doing better today and I'll start catching up on my email and with the activity on the site.  I should be back working on the engine tomorrow.
