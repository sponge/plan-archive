Well, not a whole lot to report, except that my back pain is almost all gone!  Started doing some back exercises last week, and that's basically cleared it up :) I've started putting in full work days, and with Rick and I both working full time, things should move a little faster. We are currently preparing an "alpha" release which will go out to our associates.  Almost all the proprietary code is out now, and they are going to help us whip the rest into shape :)
