Well it took damn near forever but with much patience here they are
...our .plans.Shweeet......  First and foremost I gotta tell yah that coffee and I have become very good friends.  In fact I was thinking of getting my own personal I.V. Drip of freeze-dried folgers going on
but..that may attract unwanted attention.

6:00am I found myself finishing the storyboards for a few of our in game cinematics and trundled off home..near death...and wondering if four hours could possibly be enough sleep.  We have all been bustin' our buns to make this the best mission pakever but I suppose saying that makes thestatement a tadd cliche'...so be it.  

Setting to my right is a sorry excuse of a man. ELMAGOO... Holes in both tee shirt and in his head it amazes me he can walk.  Prior to comming here he was said to have been a human being.  We are not positive but there may be hope for him yet. :P

Enough rambling.....I've got more coffee to drink and artsy shhtuff to do...
