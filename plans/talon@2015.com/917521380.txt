Greetings and salutations...*cough*(Rids himself of the Cleese accent and continues to ponder ... THINGS ... )  >>

I have decided that there are a few THINGS that need addressed or at least "voiced" on how I see the gaming industry.  Allow me to ramble, if you will, and at the end comment upon it if you see fit.  At this time I would also like to reiterate that these are MY opinions and have NOTHING to do with my fellow colleagues or the awesome company I work for.
That said......
For a very long time I had thought that, if given the chance, I could make a small difference in how the industry perceives the public.  It was my thought that we, as developers/publishers/business people, should look upon the public as our clients.  Making clients happy gets you both more clients and more money, which then can be turned into new and original stories/games.  This, in turn, then continues in a groovy little loop which makes EVERYONE happy.
The point being that we as developers have more of a responsibility than just to make the publisher or the middleman happy.  We have an even greater responsibility to insure that YOU, the public, actually consider your money well spent when picking up a title off of the shelf.
I personally believe that 'more of the same' is a lame excuse meaning that we don't have the balls to try something new.  What's wrong with new as long as it's fun and doesn't piss off the Vatican?  In fact I truly believe that you can only fool some of the people some of the time but not all of the people ALL of the time.  I believe that very soon, the game consumer will grow tired of the same old and want something fresh.  SURE it can be a FPS but by the GODS don't make me run through another damned dungeon! *S*  As serious as this issue is I see it as rather humorous.  I mean what do we think you are? Cattle? NO. Uneducated Riff-raff? NO. Perhaps semi-evolved simmians with a wide wallet? Again, NO.  So why at times does it seem that THAT is the way you are treated?  I see the patches flying left and right and it truly skeeves me.  All of you out there who read this should know that I still go to the store and..yes...PURCHASE a game.  Fresh off the shelf it comes and BOOM! Patch time.  I ask...what if I didn't have the means to access the net?  Or, for that matter, have a clue that a patch was ever released?
Hell, I could be sitting at home and think it's my system that buggy when in fact it's the game.  So what do I do?  I sigh and throw the game back into it's box which then finds it's way to a dusty shelf; part of the "Bad Choice" game library that grows exponentially each month...I swear!
So what we SHOULD be doing is taking a bit more pride in what we make.  Screw the dealines and do the job the right way the first time.  We should make not just good games but GREAT games.  And we should never ever forget who we are making them for....not egos..or inside politics...but for you. After all it's you who keep us going.

*WHEW!*  Now I feel better! 
Talon exits.....(stage RIGHT)

P.S.  If I still have a job in the morning I didn't piss off too many people. :P
