Still working on level entity stuff with the map 
designers.. Puzzles, traps, effects... that kind of
stuff.  I've also been doing some work on the 
rendering engine in my spare time.

Jason Hall of Monolith was here yesterday showing us 
LithTech and Shogo.  The game looks bad ass!  I think
it's gonna be one of those "must have" games - I can't 
wait to get myself a copy once it's in the stores.  
Good job guys..

Been working on the code for all the level entity stuff 
for Daikatana.  It's a lot of fun - each item only takes
a few days at the most so it all stays very interesting.

I'd like to say that the Daikatana team is a great bunch
of guys to work with.  Everyone is very passionate about 
their work and the game.  

Here's a sampling of what I've been working on over the 
past couple of months:

* added parent/child entities and bmodels.. allows for 
  some cool stuff and game play interaction
* added func_nodetrain... which acts as a normal train
  but follows our track node system to various desti-
  nations.. there is a lot that can be done with this
* added func_dynalight... which can be a dynamic light,
  a lightflare or a spotlight (with cone).. and can be 
  linked to a parent entity so it can move/rotate/etc..
* added various items and power ups into the game
* numerous bug fixes and Q2 feature merges
* numerous map editor fixes and features

Current task list:

+ add a lightning entity that uses Mike and Adam's 
  spline based lightning for Dabug's episode.. it looks
  very cool and will zap the $%#! out of you
+ pseudo shadows on players and monsters
+ various projectile launchers
+ Inmater possession code (input entity stuff)

Oh.. and thanks to Jake for my new handle.. I like it
better than the one I've used for years.. 'DarkFrog'
There are so many "dark" entities out there nowadays
it'll be a nice change.
