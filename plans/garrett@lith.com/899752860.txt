Well it has been sometime since I last updated my Plan file
so, here goes.
I just got done illustrating the ad for Get Medieval and Adam has applied his usual layout magic. It's pretty fun and will be in all of the big mags I think in a couple of months(not sure though). So I'm free of marketing art for a little bit and can get caught up on the game.
Also, if anyone out there is a, or knows a  kick-ass texture artist or level designer please go to the jobs page at lith.com and send me the goods.  We need a handful of texture artists as well as level designers for our next projects. Thanks.
If you read Aaron St.John's Plan you know pretty much who is who on our team and that we are working on a mega-cool new title which we are not allowed to talk too much about yet. In the not too distant future these plans about this game will become less vague.
Seiko and I are  working on the second of the two players that you can choose from in the single player version of the game and he looks awesome! Later this week we will begin working on the main baddies as well as refinements to the hero and heroin(the person not the drug). All in all the entire team has made alot of progress on the game and interface design and are ready to start building the real deal.  Did I mention that this game is going to be very fresh, cool and fun?
On the home front...Still no baby yet but my wife is huge and very uncomfortable so any day now my sleep will be taken from me.
And I'll try to be better about updating the old Plan.
