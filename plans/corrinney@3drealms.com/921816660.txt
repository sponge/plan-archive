I recently sent off a batch of email responses. It may take up to 2 months + for me to respond to email you send me. I do like hearing from "most" of you. :)
Coded several cool new 3D engine "things" (not telling ya ;p yet ), and spent the last couple of days to make all of them go "very fast". (Some of them were very sloow when I first put them up.) And coded several "givens." Onto coding more "givens" and more "new things."
The new 3DR engine I am coding does not use and is not based on Prey code. It does not use portal nor BSP for visibility. It uses CCP. What it stands for, I am not telling yet. ;p Though the letters really do stand for something. (Hint : they are mathematical terms.)
The code, or rather system, I am building now is more useful, less hackful, and more innovative/creative than what I could do hacking (and losing :( ) pieces here and there into Q2.
Am not going to show new engine for E3. All of you should check out and concentrate on Duke Nukem Forever, which is going to be a very fun game at E3!
Almost the entire company is working on DNF, except for Tom helping me out. DNF would be very fun. There would not be a word of info on the new engine, not a picture of screenshot of the "new game", until DNF is near shrink wrap. :)
