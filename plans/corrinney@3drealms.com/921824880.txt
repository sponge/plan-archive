I recently sent off a batch of email responses. It may take up to 2 months + for me to respond to email you send me. I do like hearing from "most" of you. :)
Coded several cool new 3D engine "things" (not telling ya ;p yet ), and spent the last couple of days to make all of them go "very fast". (Some of them were very sloow when I first put them up.) And coded several "givens." Onto coding more "givens" and more "new things."
The new 3DR engine I am coding does not use 
and is not based on Prey code. It does not use portal nor BSP for visibility. It uses CCP. What it stands for, I am not telling yet. ;p Though the letters really do stand for something. (Hint : they are mathematical terms.)
The code, or rather system, I am building now is more useful, less hackful, and more innovative/creative than what I could do hacking (and losing :( ) pieces here and there into Q2.
