Status of 3DNOW support, 1.02 patch, 2015 pack "Wages of Sin"

The 1.02 version contains:

- AMD 3DNOW support
- Creative EAX support
- specific support for 2015's mission pack, "Wages of Sin"
- save game fix, which fixes crash in Area 57
- software crashes on Dam
- various bug fixes

1.02 is FULLY COMPATIBLE with 1.01, so servers will not need to upgrade unless
they want to.  1.01 save games will be FULLY COMPATIBLE with 1.02.

Originally, I was going to release the 3DNOW support and EAX support as a
public beta.  Because of the timing of "Wages of Sin", Activision and us
mutually agreed to hold back another version so that there would only be one
version 1.02.  That version is currently in heavy beta testing and as soon as
Activision's QA signs off on it, it will be released to the net.

I apologize for the delay (especially to the 3DNOW users out there).

Wait until you play "Wages of Sin", especially in Deathmatch.  The 2015
development team have done an amazing job and I think a lot of people are
going to dig it.

Shameless requests for help

1.  I am interested in finding software (linkable library, source, or stand alone
utility) which will take a sound file and dump out time coded phoenemes.
Obviously this is for a lip synching application.  I am curious how other
developers have dealt with this, specifically if they had this technology
which they could then animate a characters face on demand or if all animations
with speech were specifically created for each piece of dialog.  Thanks in
advance.

2.  Ritual has a bunch o' video (arcade) games and in some of them we have some
annoying problems.  Super Sprint for example has monitor blanking issues.  I
was hoping that someone out there in the DFW area would be able to offer their
services to give me a brief tutorial on dealing with fly back transformers and
any knowledge they might have on machines.  I am a CE, so I know my away
around a circuit, but I have never dealt with high voltage electronics like
monitors.  What is in it for you?  Depending on how much you help ;) an
autographed copy of Sin, a T-shirt and lunch (or dinner) on us.  Thanks.
