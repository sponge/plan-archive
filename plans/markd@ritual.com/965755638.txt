Heavy Metal FAKK 2

Thanks for everyone purchasing Heavy Metal FAKK 2.  I hope everyone out there
enjoys the heck out of it.  As is often the case with software development, we
have had reports of lockups and crashes on exit with certain machine
configurations.  We are working very hard to solve these problems so that
everyone can enjoy the game.  We will have a patch out for the game this
weekend.  If you are experiencing any lockup or exit problems with FAKK 2,
and live in the DFW area, please email me.  Of course every system we tested
the game on before shipping it did not exhibit any of these problems.
