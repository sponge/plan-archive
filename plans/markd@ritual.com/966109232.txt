Ritual Entertainment's 4th Anniversary

I cannot believe another year has already flown by, but its true.  Just 4
short years ago Ritual Entertainment opened up its doors.  4 products later
(Scourge of Armagon, Sin, Wages of Sin and Heavy Metal FAKK 2), we are still
going strong.  This fall we'll be scaring you with our action-oriented take
on the Blair Witch series in Blair Witch Volume 3: The Elly Kedward Tale and
next year we'll be pushing the gaming envelope once again in some soon to be
announced titles.  I want to take a moment to thank all of our wonderful fans
out there for sticking with us during this time.  I know it hasn't always
been easy to overlook some of our mistakes but I hope our successes and fun
products have more than made up for them.

Ritual Entertainment is dedicated to delivering top quality entertainment for
all game platforms, we hope we'll be here for another 4 years to continue our
mission.  Special Thanks to www.ritualistic.com, www.fakkyou.com and
www.2015.com, we couldn't have done this without you guys.


Heavy Metal FAKK2 Patch

I have gotten some email from people wondering where the patch is now that
the demo has been released.  I want to make sure that all our customers out
there don't feel neglected.  We decided to release the demo first before the
patch so we could make sure we had worked out all the issues on launch.  The
demo contains the most recent code and serves as the test platform for next
weeks patch.


Heavy Metal FAKK2 Performance (revisited)

I should have been clearer in my earlier update, the demo "demo1" only exists
in the demo version of Heavy Metal FAKK2

Heavy Metal FAKK 2 Demo

The demo has been uploaded to Gigex and should be on their site by Midnight
CST.  We will be releasing a patch for the entire game early next week.  The
demo consists of:

4 different levels
3 different Julie Skins
8 different weapons
5 different monsters

Grab the demo, you won't be sorry.


Heavy Metal FAKK 2 Performance

For those sites that have been looking for a performance evaluation tool for
FAKK 2, enable timedemo and type "demo demo1"

Voodoo 2 owners

We figured out why some of the voodoo owners out there were having trouble and
this will definitely be addressed in the upcoming patch.  In the meantime you
can do the following to run with a vodoo2:
- delete your config.cfg in your fakk directory, should be c:Program
FilesRitual EntertainmentHeavy Metal - FAKK2fakkconfig.cfg
- Either modify your shortcut in the Start menu, create a new short cut or run
FAKK 2 from the command line.  Add "+set r_colorbits 0" to the shortcut.

There is a problem in the executable that has since been fixed where if the
colorbits are already set to 16, it will not fail on the last check for
starting opengl32.dll (the default OGL driver which happens to be software
only when you have a Voodoo 2 in your machine) and subsequently special Voodoo
2 code is never executed.

Heavy Metal FAKK 2

Thanks for everyone purchasing Heavy Metal FAKK 2.  I hope everyone out there
enjoys the heck out of it.  As is often the case with software development, we
have had reports of lockups and crashes on exit with certain machine
configurations.  We are working very hard to solve these problems so that
everyone can enjoy the game.  We will have a patch out for the game this
weekend.  If you are experiencing any lockup or exit problems with FAKK 2,
and live in the DFW area, please email me.  Of course every system we tested
the game on before shipping it did not exhibit any of these problems.
