Some Thoughts
=============
- Marsha Brady turned 42 yesterday.
- 10 years ago I was using a Commodore 128 with 128k RAM at 1Mhz, today I use
a Pentium II 300 with 128Mb of RAM, That is 1024 times the memory and 300
times the speed.
- The days of the week are named after the 7 planets (pagans thought there
were only 7 including the moon and the sun)
- Never mention a surprise even if you don't nail down a date ;)

Demo News
=========
- the demo patch continues.  Activision has been doing some QA on one, and
some more stuff cropped up, but it shouldn't be too much longer.  3.17 has
been successfully merged in the code.  The network traffic has been
dramatically reduced.  Everything mentioned below has made it in there.
- Has anyone made their own HUD files out there?

I am blown away by all the cool things happening online with Sin. The response
has been beyond words, and the team spirit at Ritual is high.  We are
anxious to finish the rest of the game as I am sure you are anxious to play
it.  Here is some info:

- There will definitely be a patch to the demo to fix a number of issues, most
of these have to do with multiplayer:
1.  Remove cheat codes we overlooked (sorry)
2.  Speed of net traffic (there were a few optimizations that didn't make it
in before the demo)
3.  Fix Zombie problems on servers
4.  Fix dedicated server heartbeat problems.
5.  Camgun problems in Bank
6.  Menu options which are active but don't affect anything in game (these
will be disabled)
7.  Initial 3D Audio support
8.  sounds not playing when fov > 90
9.  A bunch of other stuff that escapes me.

- Don( OneThumb ) will be putting a known bugs section in front of the Sin Bug
submission form, so we can cut down on dupe submissions.

- It is great to see benchmarks out there, BUT please keep in mind that Sin
has really not gone through the optimization phase yet.  This is something I
had planned before the demo, but alas, time sux.  The numbers you see around
are sure to increase by the time the game ships.  We will most likely still be
a little slower than Q2, because our world and model poly counts are just
plain higher, but I think the benchmarks will be a lot closer.

- look for a Ritual surprise next week :)

- One more thing, Sin is not a 3rd person game, but if you hit F6 or
"toggleviewmode" it will put you in 3rd person, the update to the demo should
have the 3D crosshair we had in at E3, which actually allows you to play the
game from a 3rd person perspective.  This can be fun.
