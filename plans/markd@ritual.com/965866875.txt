Voodoo 2 owners

We figured out why some of the voodoo owners out there were having trouble and
this will definitely be addressed in the upcoming patch.  In the meantime you
can do the following to run with a vodoo2:
- delete your config.cfg in your fakk directory, should be c:Program
FilesRitual EntertainmentHeavy Metal - FAKK2fakkconfig.cfg
- Either modify your shortcut in the Start menu, create a new short cut or run
FAKK 2 from the command line.  Add "+set r_colorbits 0" to the shortcut.

There is a problem in the executable that has since been fixed where if the
colorbits are already set to 16, it will not fail on the last check for
starting opengl32.dll (the default OGL driver which happens to be software
only when you have a Voodoo 2 in your machine) and subsequently special Voodoo
2 code is never executed.

Heavy Metal FAKK 2

Thanks for everyone purchasing Heavy Metal FAKK 2.  I hope everyone out there
enjoys the heck out of it.  As is often the case with software development, we
have had reports of lockups and crashes on exit with certain machine
configurations.  We are working very hard to solve these problems so that
everyone can enjoy the game.  We will have a patch out for the game this
weekend.  If you are experiencing any lockup or exit problems with FAKK 2,
and live in the DFW area, please email me.  Of course every system we tested
the game on before shipping it did not exhibit any of these problems.
