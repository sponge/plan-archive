Sin Movie!
==========

Yester day we received a small package from our good friends ADVFilms
containing the latest trailer of the Sin Anime.  I can't tell you how cool it
was for the entire Sin team to sit in the TV room and watch the carnage unfold
on the screen.  There is nothing quite like Anime when it comes to

Sin Version 1.06
================

Version 1.06 is out the door and can be found on www.ritualistic.com.  For
those of you who already have version 1.05, you should use the 1.04->1.06
patch.  The difference betwen the 1.05->1.06 and the 1.04->1.06 was less than
10k and since they were functionally equivalent, I decided to release just the
one patch.

The new version includes a new deathmatch map from Zor called Spool as well as
speech synthesis support.

SINCTF News
===========

I fixed the invisibility bug (I think) in Sin.  The new version is running at
sinctf and debugctf. If anyone can still cheat, please let me know directly.

Version 1.06 should be ready to roll, as long as this bug has been squashed.

Camera system in version 1.05
=============================

If you want to play around with the camera system, add these to your config.
This is a pretty good setup for working with cameras.

bind INS "cam add"
bind DEL "cam delete"
bind PGDN "cam prev"
bind PGUP "cam next"
bind HOME "cam loop"
bind END "cam stop"

There was no real reason for the camera system other than that it was cool,
and that it would help out in someone's internal side project. Enjoy.

Sin Version 1.05
================

It should be up on our ftp site shortly, and from there it will probably get
mirrored to your favorite website.

General
- An in game camera system has been added similar to the one we were showing
at E3.
- Extensive 3DNOW! optimizations have been made to the renderer
- demos work again

CTF
- ctf_forcejoin now works correctly.
- dropped weapons no longer allow you to carry too much ammo
- the quantum destabilizer is no longer such an unbalanced weapon in CTF.

E3

Thanks to everyone who came and saw the demo we were giving of FAKK 2.  It is
nice to know that even though our industry is in a moral crisis, people still
enjoy a FANTASY based on sex, drugs and rock and roll.  The competition looked
awesome (as always). Vampire, Anacronox, Voyager and Oni all made me want to
rush back to Dallas so I could continue working. ;)
