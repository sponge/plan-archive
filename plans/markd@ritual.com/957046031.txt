Ritual visits ADV Films in Houston

Yesterday six of the old fakking crew headed down to Houston to check out the
japanese cut of Sin The Movie.  The movie kicked ass all the way from Houston
back to Dallas.  I cannot express in words how cool it is to see something
that you helped create get turned into a movie.

Everyone at ADV Films was super nice and we even got to do some voice overs
from the film.  When you buy the DVD version of the film it will be loaded
with tons of extra goodies including interviews with Ritual and the rest of
the guys from ADV.  I want to personally thank Andy, Dan and John for showing
us such a great time in Houston.  Also thanks to Tricia from
www.3dactionplanet.com for hanging out with us during the day.

Sin at E3

There will be a Sin deathmatch tournament at this years E3 in LA being put on
by ADV Films and sponsored by AMD and Ritual.  On the first day of the show go
to ADV Films' booth #2674 in the west wing to sign up for the tournament.
There are some awesome prizes for the tournament including stills from the
movie and cutting edge hardware.  The tournament itself will be held the
second day of E3 and Ritualites will be on hand to cheer you on.  You will
need to be an official attendant of E3 in order to play in the tournament
and before you ask, no I don't have any extra passes. ;) If you have any
other questions about the tournament, please send them to
<e3deathmatch@ritual.com>

Be sure to stay tuned to www.sinthemovie.com for late breaking news. See you
all at E3!
