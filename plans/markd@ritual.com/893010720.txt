- What's up with Alex St. John? Is he a glutton for punishment? How can
any educated (supposedly knowledgable) person make those statements about
Quake or QuakeII?  Last time I checked, he didn't have a programming
credit on the game, and on top of that, talk to any Riva, Rendition, PCX2
or 740 (well soon to be) owner out there and ask them about their GLIDE
drivers for their video cards.  The forementioned cards are mostly D3D
cards with OGL drivers written post hoc.  They do not support GLIDE, and
they do not need to thanks to the vanilla (mostly) OGL implementation
Carmack used in Quake and Quake II.  In fact the only mention of "VOODOO"
in the engine is there to handle gamma correction, because OGL doesn't
have a standard Gamma extension.


- Here is an old arcade game tip.  If the game is going to be an office or
anywhere where more than one person uses it (besides yourself), only buy
those games that have multi-player capability.  Jim and Don were bad the
other weekend and no we are the proud owners of 23 video games.
Hmmm...time for that Ritual Arcade we have been talking about.  Anyway, of
those 23, here are the games that are actually played: Capcom Bowling,
Mini-Golf, Super Sprint, Championship Street Fighter.

- SinEd is proving to be an awesome development tool.  I think the add-on
community will be pretty comfortable with it when it comes out.  Once
again, I don't need any more help with modeless dialogs.  That is all
working quite nicely now.  I think with 2500 textures, and 200 models at
your disposal you will not want for quite some time when the game is
released.  It is very cool to place a model in the editor and be able to
see him right away, pose him, scale him and rotate him just perfectly.

- For the record, my handle is "MarkGyver" not "Beepo" or "Nostradamus".

Man you guys rock.  Thank you, Thank you for the solution to my modeless woes.
Here is the short and sweet solution for the curious. In your main message
handler you need to put in a call to "IsDialogMessage" with the handle of your
modeless dialog boxes and than all is hunky dory.  This actually makes
compelete senes in a Win32 way, but sometimes you look for a much more complex
solution to a simple problem.  I can't believe that I would have to insert an
"IsDialogMessage" call for everyone of my modeless dialog boxes, but this
seems to be the case.  In any case, thanks for all the great advice.

As far as the "Vaporware" thing goes.  I got a bunch of supportive email and a
bunch calling Sin a TC or worse a level pack.  Folks, let me assure you that
Sin is a full blown game with amazing characters, weapons and gameplay that
just happens to use an enhanced Quake II model to push pixels on the screen,
and send packets over the net.  Anyone who has followed Ritual/Hipnotic knows
that we are about quality and originality, you will not be disappointed with
Sin.

I just love being called "Vaporware", it really gives you that warm and fuzzy
feeling all over.  For the record, Sin began development April 1st, 1997.  It
is now April 15th, 1998.  That means that we have been in development for
1.039 years.  Now I won't say how long other games called "Vaporware" have
been in development, but a year is about 6 months sooner than any game since
Wolfenstein 3D.  So the next time, someone decides to talk dirt about our
baby, I would appreciate if they looked at the facts first.

Help me!  I have this one problem in SinEd that has driven me nuts from day
one, and I was hoping some Win32 guru out there may be able to shed some light
on the situation.  I have a dialog which I open with a CreateDialog call.  I
have my own DialogWinProc to handle the Dialog.  The WM_INITDIALOG message
returns FALSE, indicating that windows should not give me the focus (if I do,
keyboard focus goes away and I can't ever get it back).  Now here is my
problem, with this setup, the TAB key will not tab between my various
TABSTOPS.  If however, I create the dialog with a DialogBox call, everything
works fine.  Frankly I am perplexed, and annoyed why the two have had such
different behaviors.  I would be happy just being able to get keyboard input
into that WinProc, but it does not respond to WM_KEYDOWN events either.  Any
thoughts out there would be most welcome.  Besides, you'll be helping
yourselves, 'cause when Sin ships so will SinEd.

Thanks.
