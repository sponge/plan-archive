- Back in my day, we'd have to walk 10 miles through punch cards to make a
plan update.  These kids these days (especially the ones born after Star
Wars) just don't appreciate their plan files. :)

- Went to Ion's open house two nights in a row. woohoo.  They have a kick
ass office space and the demo reel for Daikatana, Anachronox and Dominion
was very cool as well.  Tom, the look of Anachronox is way cool, if you
pull off even half of what you are planning it is going to be a very cool
game.  Daikatana boasted some really cool art and some great models.
Dominion was very slick, but not having played it, I can't say anything
about the gameplay.  The one thing which really left an impression on me
though was the music, the music for Daikatana and Anachronox just ruled.

- Working on the final touches of integration of our Sin model system into
the Quake 2 engine.  After that we should be back to where we were (tech
wise) at the beginning of January.  I hate tech changes this late in the
project, but believe me the new stuff we were able to add because of the
Q2 tech will knock your socks off.  No really we have this really cool
Sock Technology (tm) and when you combine it with our Pants Technology
(tm), it really rocks. :)
