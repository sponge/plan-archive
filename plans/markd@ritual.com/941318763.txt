As Blade would have said, "Damn, another Sin Anniversary."  Well actually
today marks the first anniversary of Sin going gold.  Just 12 short
months ago, the team of Ritual ended 18 months of hard work and shipped the
final gold master to Activision. After duplication and distribution, it turned
up on store shelves on November 5th (and promptly be patched two weeks later,
but we won't talk about that).

Thanks to all our fans for making it worthwhile, long live Blade, Elexis, JC
and the beautiful city of Freeport.
