- Sin is Gold - expect to see it on store shelves in 7 days.  A big thanks
goes out to the Sin Team for doing such an excellent job.

- All of us at Ritual are sad to see Charlie Wiederhold go, but we wish him
the best over at 3D Realms.  Charlie was an integral member of the Sin team
and the game would not have been the same without him.  And Charlie, remember
the secret rendezvous code, this will be your only point of contact ;)

- On an unrelated note - I meant to spew my thoughts on this subject months
ago, but that silly old game got in the way.  With Clinton facing impeachment
and all, what will probably happen is he will slowly wither until he resigns.
F*ck that, these are some the things I would do being the most powerful man in
the world.

- Take a small team of commandos over to the gulf, insert them into Baghdad
and do a little house cleaning if you know what I mean.

- After that little trip, make a pass through eastern europe and settle
some of this ethnic cleansing once and for all.

- repeal the laws banning hemp growth.  "I didn't inhale" my ass!

- reveal the identities of the masked magician, evil avatar, the green
lantern, and bitchx!

Ever since Ford passed the law that America would not assassinate anyone, our
hands have been tied.   It would really be cool to see a president take those
actions, it's kind of like a captain going down with the ship.
