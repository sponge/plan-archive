A few things

- 3DNOW - I worked very hard on getting 3DNOW support in for the 1.01 patch,
unfortunately there were a lot of issues with their 3dfxgl driver (it didn't
recognize my PURE3D).  Right now I am in a holding pattern waiting on AMD to
see what they do to improve their optimized drivers.  Another issue that came
up is that the 3DNOW optimization is basically targetted solely at VOODOO
customers.  Anybody out there own a K6 and not use a VOODOO based video card?
It seemed to me like there would be quite a few people in this situation and I
want to make sure the optimized 3DNOW driver is compatible with all the
popular cards.

- Tools - I am getting the new tools ready for release.  This time I will also
include the MAX and MAX2 plugins (compiled) sorry about that, didn't realize I
just sent out source.  Incidentally, the MAXSDK comes on every MAX disk.

- Source - We are also putting together a release of the source code for the
gaming dll, this will take a little longer because it will be our first
release ( the tools as you know had already been released for the demo ).

- Patch - I hope everyone is Sinning out there ;).  I apologize for the change
in Save games, but since most of the level scripts had changed, the old save
games were truly no longer compatible.
