- Mike Werckle has headed back up north.  He is pursuing a freelance job in
Chicago which will last approximately 3 months.  At the end of that time he
may come back to rejoin the tribe.  His leaving was amicable and we wish him
the best of luck.

Thought Update
==============
- Jan Brady is 40.
- The reason I mentioned the commodore was because the memory increase was a
cool 2^10.  Yeah, 20 years ago in '78 I use my first TRS-80 with 16k and
100khz, which would mean a 2^13 increase in memory and 3000 times increase in
speed, but I thought this was cooler.
- Maybe I shouldn't have said "named" after the planets.  I got numerous
etymological accounts how this day was based on this Norse god etc.  What I
should have said was that if you look at all the modern european languages
(where english was partially derived from) the days of the week are based on
the fact that there were 7 planets.  So the "concept" of 7 days came from the
pagans, and Norse mythology lent us a whole bunch of "snazzy" names (Not!).

Some Thoughts
=============
- Marsha Brady turned 42 yesterday.
- 10 years ago I was using a Commodore 128 with 128k RAM at 1Mhz, today I use
a Pentium II 300 with 128Mb of RAM, That is 1024 times the memory and 300
times the speed.
- The days of the week are named after the 7 planets (pagans thought there
were only 7 including the moon and the sun)
- Never mention a surprise even if you don't nail down a date ;)

Demo News
=========
- the demo patch continues.  Activision has been doing some QA on one, and
some more stuff cropped up, but it shouldn't be too much longer.  3.17 has
been successfully merged in the code.  The network traffic has been
dramatically reduced.  Everything mentioned below has made it in there.
- Has anyone made their own HUD files out there?

I am blown away by all the cool things happening online with Sin. The response
has been beyond words, and the team spirit at Ritual is high.  We are
anxious to finish the rest of the game as I am sure you are anxious to play
it.  Here is some info:

- There will definitely be a patch to the demo to fix a number of issues, most
of these have to do with multiplayer:
1.  Remove cheat codes we overlooked (sorry)
2.  Speed of net traffic (there were a few optimizations that didn't make it
in before the demo)
3.  Fix Zombie problems on servers
4.  Fix dedicated server heartbeat problems.
5.  Camgun problems in Bank
6.  Menu options which are active but don't affect anything in game (these
will be disabled)
7.  Initial 3D Audio support
8.  sounds not playing when fov > 90
9.  A bunch of other stuff that escapes me.

- Don( OneThumb ) will be putting a known bugs section in front of the Sin Bug
submission form, so we can cut down on dupe submissions.

- It is great to see benchmarks out there, BUT please keep in mind that Sin
has really not gone through the optimization phase yet.  This is something I
had planned before the demo, but alas, time sux.  The numbers you see around
are sure to increase by the time the game ships.  We will most likely still be
a little slower than Q2, because our world and model poly counts are just
plain higher, but I think the benchmarks will be a lot closer.

- look for a Ritual surprise next week :)

- One more thing, Sin is not a 3rd person game, but if you hit F6 or
"toggleviewmode" it will put you in 3rd person, the update to the demo should
have the 3D crosshair we had in at E3, which actually allows you to play the
game from a 3rd person perspective.  This can be fun.
