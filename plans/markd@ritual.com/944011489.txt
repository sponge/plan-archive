Ritual CTF Servers

debugctf and sinctf are both back up and running.
- Sinctf is just running standard Sin CTF.
- Debugctf is running Wages of Sin CTF.

If you have any requests (map exclusions, that sort of thing) please let me
know.  Enjoy.

Unreal Tournament

Tim, Cliffy B, James, Steve and the rest of the funky bunch did an amazing
job.  My hat is off to you guys for creating such a fun and user friendly
deathmatch experience.  I haven't even gotten online yet because playing
against the bots are just as much fun and unlike human opponents they actually
obey your commands. :)

Sin Version 1.10

Check out www.ritualistic.com for the latest Sin patch 1.10.  Here are the
fixes from the readmes.

- Cheat variable protected a bunch of developer commands
- fixed CTF flag cheat where you could join the other team while taking the
flag with you.
- say_talk spamming fixed
- various bug fixes
- added cl_speechdelay - spam control for speech synthesis, defaults to 1000
- added cl_nospeech - archived cvar that controls whether or not speech is active
- added ctf_forcejoin as archivable variable.
- fixed bug with cinematics and Direct X 7.0
- fixed annoying phantom windows that are left after vid_restarting

I also put out a new source archive which can be found at the same place.  If
anyone has any problems, please direct them towards sinbugs@ritual.com

As Blade would have said, "Damn, another Sin Anniversary."  Well actually
today marks the first anniversary of Sin going gold.  Just 12 short
months ago, the team of Ritual ended 18 months of hard work and shipped the
final gold master to Activision. After duplication and distribution, it turned
up on store shelves on November 5th (and promptly be patched two weeks later,
but we won't talk about that).

Thanks to all our fans for making it worthwhile, long live Blade, Elexis, JC
and the beautiful city of Freeport.
