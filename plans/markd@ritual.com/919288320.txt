Wages of Sin, the official Sin mission pack is now gold.  I want to take this
opportunity to congratulate 2015 on the outstanding job they did in putting
WOS together.  If you loved or even just liked Sin, you'll totally dig WOS.

When we finished Sin, we ended up with a game which only began to scratch
the surface of what was possible with the Sin game development system.
WOS goes much deeper and adds some totally unique aspects to the game.
Deathmatch will never be the same once you play with Hoverbikes or the game
of Informer (Smear the Queer, please no PC rants) where one person is it as
"Blade" and everyone else is "Manero".

All in all, it was a pleasure to work with the professionals at 2015 and I
hope them the very best in their new project.
