(Part 2)

Just a quick thing, that column I'm doing for Loonyboi's site is not weekly guys, it's bi-weekly.  I don't have time to do this weekly you know. :)  So don't be surprised when you don't see the next article next week, cuz it'll be the week after.

And for those of you who've already deluged me with suggestions for what kind of game to write, many thanks.  It's great to know the interest is out there.  I've pretty much made a decision on what the game's going to be, and although it wasn't taken from any of the suggestions as such, I hope people will find it fun and (at least mildly) original.  That'll be revealed in the next article, which is in TWO weeks, not one.  Remember, bi-weekly, not weekly. :)

Time to start this thing from a clean slate.  I think I need a bit less evil in my diet. :)
