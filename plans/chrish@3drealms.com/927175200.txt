Star Wars E1 Thoughts:  Good movie, left some holes but nothing that can't be remedied in E2 and E3.  The only big problem was JarJar.  Lucas, please make sure he nor any character as stupid as him shows up in any more Star Wars films, ever.  That guy was a major mistake.  Pretty much everything else was cool though.  /me will now wait for the clone wars to begin.
