Back from E3! Had a wonderful, harried time jousting between Raven's two
booths where our games were showing. People got to see Star Trek: Voyager
- Elite Force for the first time. Even in this early stage of development,
I really enjoyed demoing the game and watching everyone's reactions.
Soldier of Fortune was shown by appointment only, but that didn't keep
people from talking about the game, as these articles can attest: 
 Gamesmania
 Evil Avatar
 Sharky Extreme First Look
 PC Gamer Online
 Adrenaline Vault Interview
 Adrenaline Vault Preview
I'll try to keep an updated list of all the E3 wrap-up reviews SoF has
garnered on the Soldier of Fortune site, so keep checking!

As I attempt to truss the remaining unfinished business here at work, before I leave
for that deadly beautiful land of my former residence (namesake of that
awesome ironic Frank Black song) and the manic splendor that is E3, please
allow me to educe just this helpful quick reminder . . . Don't miss the excellent,
third (and last) installment of loonygames' comprehensive History of Raven Software,
covering Spectre (Raven's cancelled 3D engine), Heretic II, Soldier of Fortune,
and Star Trek: Voyager. Have yourselves a great restful weekend, enjoy your week
following, and I shall see you soon!

In honor of this week's massive History of Raven Software, loonygames cracks
open some of Raven's Classic Games and gives them a fresh look. This article
covers CyClones, Black Crypt, Hexen, Take No Prisoners, and MageSlayer. So head
to loonygames and get ready to get nostalgic!

Just a real quick reminder to check loonygames for the three-part Definitive History
of Raven, which started on Monday, Pt.2 continues today, and Pt.3 will finish
up this massive documentary in good stead on Friday, so look for it!

Also, I leave this Sunday for Los Angeles and E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo),
and will return the following Sunday, so to those friends and associates I won't
see during my stay in LA, I'll have Net access, so you can still reach me via email.
Have a great week!

Be sure to check out Inside Raven Software, which is a week-long feature over
on loonygames. This definitive history of Raven Software goes all the way back
from Black Crypt, to Soldier of Fortune, and everything in between. Comments
from eleven Raven employees are included, along with tons of never before heard
information about current projects (Soldier of Fortune and Star Trek: Voyager),
and even some projects never revealed before now. This is one humongous
article, spread out over Monday, Wednesday and Friday, so head back to
loonygames all this week for the unabridged History of Raven!

My buddy Jason "loonyboi" Bergman's here for a big piece on Raven for
loonygames. So I've been busily trying to arrange all of his
interviews. It's been great fun having him here, both from a work
standpoint, and for after hours Q1 & DK demo deathmatching fodder! Not to mention
loony's burgeoning kick-ass Tekken 3 skillz, which were giving me
some problems! He seems to be making the transition to 3D fighting games
amazingly well! ;)
But, I got my revenge and then some, last night when we deathmatched the
just released Heretic II Expansion Pack! (Nice transition, eh?)
Head to HereticII.com and download the Heretic II EP, and the six all-new EP DM Maps! Lovin' it!
If you can't download the files right away,
be sure to try the mirrors. The response has been overwhelmingly great so far,
let me know what you think!

One of the evolving features / trends that's come about on HereticII.com, is a
growing list of Resource Shrines. What are these, you may ask? Well, they
just sort of came about of their own accord. They're what I call particular
hosted sites that offer definitive help, knowledge, and / or file resources.
They're precipitated by, and dedicated towards a particular need in the
community. In the same way Shrines provide necessary resources on your journey
through Parthoris within Heretic II, these help to build up the community and
make it better, which is what we're all about. I'd like to extend an invitation
to anyone else out there who has an idea for a Heretic II Resource Shrine.
Put together a temporary site online (note: please don't send me a ZIP of your
site! ;-), and send me an email with the URL to take a look at it, and I just
might host it. Thanks, much!

Resource Shrines
Cults - The Shrine
Walkthrough - The Spirit Shrine
Skins - The Ghost Shrine
Maps - HereticII Atlas

I've been very much in transition, both at work and at home, since I first
transferred here to Raven, almost four weeks ago. For the first two weeks, the
apartment I moved into had been undergoing renovations in both the kitchen and
bathroom, but the end result is definitely worth all the mess and disturbance
it caused during that time. Likewise, the new area here at the Raven offices
is finally coming to fruition, and I'll be getting all settled in to my very
first real office later today! w00 h00!

We know the natives are getting restless, so we thought we'd give you a word of
assurance.
Right now, the EP is done. Jake (The Gent) Simpson has finished with the coding
that I observed him working on first-hand yesterday. The EP has been turned
over to QA for one, hopefully final session of bug inspection. But this won't
be a week-long QA thing - although, obviously no one involved is about to
release a buggy EP, which is why this process has gone on as long as it has.
But as you can tell, things are wrapping up, and you should be playing the EP
VERY soon now!

Hi, my name is William Mull. I'm known online as Phoebus, and my friends and
family call me Bill. In the future, I'll be using my .plan file to help keep you
informed on all the projects we're working on here at Raven. But for whoever's
interested, I'll begin with a quick summary of how I came to work for Raven
Software.

I worked for a year and a half as Activision's Online Production Coordinator.
Three weeks ago today, in fact, I transferred to Madison, WI to work full-time as
Raven Software's Website Administrator. It has been quite a journey from the
time I first discovered computers, which lead to the spark that changed my life,
the first time I played Wolf3D, and when I first successfully connected via modem
with my buddy in Doom. Which lead me to discover Heretic and Hexen when
those games were released. At the time, of course, I had no idea that I would
eventually find myself here at Raven, working for the developers of the games I
truly love the most.

After receiving my undergrad degree in English at the University of Georgia, I
decided to get my Master's in something to do with computers, and decided on
Instructional Technology. Although I earned my Master's degree with honors, I had
already come to the conclusion around the halfway point, that what I really
wanted to do didn't directly involve my course of study in the least. But it did lead
to me teaching myself HTML and becoming consumed with the computer gaming
scene. All of this came at a the right time for me, having played bass guitar in
the late 80's in the local music scene in Athens, GA (Seven Simons, Kilkenny Cats,
and Lotus Eaters). I look back fondly to that ten year period of my life, with lots
of great memories and no regrets. But, I realized that I didn't want to pursue the
proverbial "Rock and Roll Dream" anymore, right around the time I first
discovered computers.

I've been involved with Raven for quite a while now, ever since Hexen II was first
announced on the Net. At that time, I was running my first website, Cult of
Phoebus. Raven asked me to redesign their site, and I become their webmaster,
which was my first big break in the gaming industry. My next website,
HexenWorld, was very much a labor of love. Along with Bakshra, Richard
Connery, Upaboveit, Filth, and other online peers from those very early days of
the fledgling and often-troubled Hexen II scene, I've had the unique pleasure of
helping build from scratch and nurture an entire community.

In addition to helping to develop websites for all of Activision's games, I
continued working on my own to improve Raven's online presence. I have always
been connected and devoted to Raven. When they asked me if I'd be willing to
transfer to Wisconsin and become their Website Administrator - a new position
here, created for and by me - it didn't take me very long to reply in the
affirmative. Now that I'm here, although I'm still getting settled in, I have come
to realize that this is the creative environment I've always dreamed of working in.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, or check out what I've been working on
lately, here is my email auto-sig., which should give you a good idea of the sites
I'm now officially working on for Raven Software:

Thanks to everyone in the community I've come to know and love. Your loyalty
has greatly benefitted myself, the games, and Raven as a company. And I'm very
glad to be here to tell you that. Stay tuned for more great things to come!
