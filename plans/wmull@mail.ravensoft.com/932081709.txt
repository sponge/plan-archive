[Thurs., July 15, 1999]

For you hardcore <a href="http://www.hexenworld.com/">HexenWorld</a>ers out there, Desperado has made a new

deathmatch map, called <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Nova/9098/breakdown.zip">Breakdown</a>. There are many things in the

map's scenery that can be broken when shot, making for increasingly more

interesting deathmatch scenarios. There are also traps with which you can

either contain or kill your enemy. Pretty cool!



According to <a href="mailto:rjohnson@ravensoft.com">Rick Johnson</a>, the best 3D accelerator card for <a href="http://www.soldier-of-fortune.com/">Soldier of

Fortune</a> would be any one of the TNT cards, since we use them in-house.

They have the best performance and 32 bit rendering, so of course they

look really good in <i>SoF</i>.



<a href="mailto:cclee@ravensoft.com">Chia Chin Lee</a>, Sound Designer/Composer on <i>Soldier of Fortune</i>, sends

word that the final score for <i>SoF</i> will vary in style. Most levels will have

music cues that punctuate the action, while some levels will have dynamically

driven music segments that react to player actions.

[Wed., July 14, 1999]

<a href="mailto:mryssen@club-internet.fr">Michaël Ryssen</a> has just released <a href="http://www.raven-games.com/kokak/Heretic.htm">GLHeretic V0.7</a>, featuring dynamic (and

colored) lighting! Check out <a href="http://www.raven-games.com/kokak/glhshot.jpg">this screenshot</a>! This new version of GLHeretic

also supports MD2 files, as does his GLDoom! The problem is that there

are currently no MD2 models for <i>Heretic</i>. So, if anyone knows where to

find such models, or is brave enough to build MD2 monsters for GLHeretic,

please contact <a href="mailto:mryssen@club-internet.fr">Michaël Ryssen</a>.



If you are interested and able to help test the final version of <i>HexenWorld</i>

(finally!) next week (Monday and Tuesday, July 19th and 20th), please

send <a href="mailto:rjohnson@ravensoft.com?subject=Testing HexenWorld Final&body=Please do not remove the subject line!">Rick Johnson</a> an email. For more info, check Rick's latest .plan

update.



<a href="http://www.mirabilis.com/">ICQ</a> (everyone has that, right?) has a user-made <a href="http://www.icq.com/sounds/Computer_and_Electronic_Sounds.html">Sound Scheme</a> based on

<i>Heretic II</i>. Head to <a href="http://www.icq.com/sounds/use-schemes.html">this page</a> for installation info! There's also a great new

user-made <a href="http://www.stellarspace.com/maps/qe1m1test.zip">Heretic II DM map</a> currently playing over on the <a href="http://www.5assedmonkey.com/">5 Assed

Monkey</a> (love that name ;) server (204.0.130.113:28910).



A few people from the <i>Wisconsin State Journal</i> will be visiting the <i>Raven

Software</i> offices, doing a feature article for their 'Rhythm' section. It will

probably cover a lot about the company and the people who work here, as

well as our work on <i>Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force</i> and <i>Soldier of

Fortune</i>. Check <a href="mailto:khoekstra@ravensoft.com">Kenn Hoekstra</a>'s .plan soon for more info about that.



Check out the <a href="http://www.ga-source.com/images/101/fr1.jpg">new SoF screenshot</a> over on <a href="http://www.ga-source.com/">GA-Source</a>. The image

features the female raider, who is a member of a terrorist organization you're

trying to take down in the game.



Latest word on the <i>Soldier of Fortune</i> Demo is that yes, we will be putting

out a demo at some point, but we can't give a specific date or info on how

much or what will be included in the demo. Things are looking really good,

and we're on schedule. I'll post more info as it becomes available, but in the

meantime if you'd like to comment, head to the <a href="http://www.soldier-of-fortune.com/forums/">SoF Forums</a>.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[Fri., July 9, 1999]

Just got back from vacation - a road trip across country with my girlfriend.

Just to summarize, I flew to LA, where Laure met me at the airport.

We drove straight down to San Diego and stayed for 2 days - went to the San

Diego Zoo and the Wild Animal Park. Drove up to Las Vegas - seen one casino,

you've seen them all (smokey, gaudy, and loud). I must say, Nevada has the

ugliest desert of them all. When we crossed into Utah, it's as if the color

was suddenly turned on. People are NICE in Utah. Our first stop in Colorado,

we made a point to check out Red Rocks, that gorgeous natural ampitheater

where U2 did that great live album. Boulder, CO is by far the most incredible

town, absolutely loved it! We stayed there for 2 days, and it was the highlight

of our entire trip. As it happens, President Clinton was visiting Rapid City,

South Dakota at the same time we were driving through. The town was packed,

for the above and whatever other reason, so we didn't have a chance to see

Mount Rushmore. There weren't any vacancies anywhere around there, so we had

to keep driving. We finally found a vacancy at 3am, in the exciting metropolis

capitol of Pierre (where the exciting thing for people to do seems to be

driving to Rapid City to see Mount Rushmore and the Dinosaur Museum). Our drive

through Minnesota was about as exciting scenically as South Dakota. And finally

back home to Madison, WI! Had a WONDERFUL trip! Great to be back, finally to

have my girlfriend here with me, and to be back at work here at Raven! Took LOTS

of pictures, don't know if I'll post them online (haven't seen them yet)! As you

can imagine, after being gone for a whole week, it's been quite a job getting

caught up with email, etc. all morning! Speaking of which . . . gotta go, more

later! :-)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[Thurs., June 24, 1999]

Just wanted to reiterate what <a href="mailto:braffel@ravensoft.com">Brian Raffel</a> here at <b><i>Raven</i></b> already said

in his .plan today, and announce that <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/">Raven Software</a> is nine years

old today! It's quite an achievement - and I can contend, everyone here

actually gets along really well! Onward and upward, to even better days

here at <b><i>Raven Software</i></b> than the first 3105 have been!



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[Wed., June 23, 1999]

The initial "Coming Soon" page on <a href="http://www.eliteforce.net/">www.eliteforce.net</a> & <a href="http://www.hazardteam.com/">www.hazardteam.com</a>

(both domains are for the same site) has gone live, alerting the masses

to look for our official <i>Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force</i> site, which

we'll be unveiling in the near future! w00 h00, again!



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[Tues., June 22, 1999]

The brand spankin' newly redesigned <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/">Ravensoft.com</a> site is finally

online! w00 h00! Thanks very much to everyone who helped make the site a

reality! Watch for more great things to come! :-)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[Sat., June 12, 1999]

Just a quick update to say that today is my birthday :-)

Myself and some friends from work here at Raven are going someplace

good to eat (as yet undetermined), and then to see The Spy Who Shagged Me

(yeah, bay-bee!). Thanks to my loved ones and friends, for all the kindness

and joy you've brought to my life, and for thinking of me on this day.

Everyone, have a safe and happy weekend, and have fun in my honor! :-Þ



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[Mon., May 17, 1999]

Back from E3! Had a wonderful, harried time jousting between <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/">Raven</a>'s two

booths where our games were showing. People got to see <i>Star Trek: Voyager

- Elite Force</i> for the first time. Even in this early stage of development,

I really enjoyed demoing the game and watching everyone's reactions.

<a href="http://www.soldier-of-fortune.com/">Soldier of Fortune</a> was shown by appointment only, but that didn't keep

people from talking about the game, as these articles can attest: 

<ul><li> <a href="http://www.gamesmania.com/english/sneak/new/acte3/acte3.htm">Gamesmania</a></li>

<li> <a href="http://pile.evilavatar.com/e3day1.htm">Evil Avatar</a></li>

I'll try to keep an updated list of all the E3 wrap-up reviews <i>SoF</i> has

garnered on the <a href="http://www.soldier-of-fortune.com/">Soldier of Fortune</a> site, so keep checking!



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[Sat., May 8, 1999]

As I attempt to truss the remaining unfinished business here at work, before I leave

for that deadly beautiful land of my former residence (namesake of that

awesome ironic Frank Black song) and the manic splendor that is E3, please

allow me to educe just this helpful quick reminder . . . Don't miss the excellent,

<a href="http://www.loonygames.com/content/1.36/feat/index6.shtml">third (and last) installment</a> of <a href="http://www.loonygames.com/">loonygames</a>' comprehensive <a href="http://www.loonygames.com/content/1.36/feat/">History of Raven Software</a>,

and <i>Star Trek: Voyager</i>. Have yourselves a great restful weekend, enjoy your week

following, and I shall see you soon!

[Mon., May 3, 1999]

Be sure to check out <a href="http://www.loonygames.com/content/new/">Inside Raven Software</a>, which is a week-long feature over

on <a href="http://www.loonygames.com/">loonygames</a>. This definitive history of <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/">Raven Software</a> goes all the way back

from <i>Black Crypt</i>, to <i>Soldier of Fortune</i>, and everything in between. Comments

from eleven <i>Raven</i> employees are included, along with tons of never before heard

information about current projects (<i>Soldier of Fortune</i> and <i>Star Trek: Voyager</i>),

and even some projects never revealed before now. This is one humongous

article, spread out over Monday, Wednesday and Friday, so head back to

<a href="http://www.loonygames.com/">loonygames</a> all this week for the unabridged <a href="http://www.loonygames.com/content/new/">History of Raven</a>!



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[Thurs., Mar. 18, 1999]

My buddy <a href="mailto:jason@loonygames.com">Jason "loonyboi" Bergman</a>'s here for a big piece on <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/">Raven</a> for

<a href="http://www.loonygames.com/">loonygames</a>. So I've been busily trying to arrange all of his

interviews. It's been great fun having him here, both from a work

standpoint, and for after hours <i>Q1</i> & <i>DK demo</i> deathmatching fodder! Not to mention

loony's burgeoning kick-ass <i>Tekken 3</i> skillz, which were giving me

some problems! He seems to be making the transition to 3D fighting games

amazingly well! ;)

But, I got my revenge and then some, last night when we deathmatched the

just released <b>Heretic II Expansion Pack</b>! (Nice transition, eh?)

Head to <a href="http://www.hereticii.com/">HereticII.com</a> and download the <a href="http://www.hereticii.com/her2epdoc.html">Heretic II EP</a>, and the <i>six all-new EP DM Maps</i>! <i>Lovin' it!</i>

If you can't download the files right away,

be sure to try the mirrors. The response has been overwhelmingly great so far,

<a href="mailto:wmull@mail.ravensoft.com">let me know</a> what you think!



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[Mon., Mar. 8, 1999]

One of the evolving features / trends that's come about on <a href="http://www.HereticII.com/">HereticII.com</a>, is a

growing list of <i>Resource Shrines</i>. What are these, you may ask? Well, they

just sort of came about of their own accord. They're what I call particular

hosted sites that offer definitive help, knowledge, and / or file resources.

They're precipitated by, and dedicated towards a particular need in the

community. In the same way Shrines provide necessary resources on your journey

through Parthoris within <i>Heretic II</i>, these help to build up the community and

make it better, which is what we're all about. I'd like to extend an invitation

to anyone else out there who has an idea for a <i>Heretic II Resource Shrine</i>.

Put together a temporary site online (note: please <i>don't</i> send me a ZIP of your

site! ;-), and <a href="mailto:wmull@mail.ravensoft.com">send me an email</a> with the URL to take a look at it, and I just

might host it. Thanks, much!



<b>Resource Shrines</b>

[Wed., Mar. 3, 1999]

I've been very much in transition, both at work and at home, since I first

transferred here to Raven, almost four weeks ago. For the first two weeks, the

apartment I moved into had been undergoing renovations in both the kitchen and

bathroom, but the end result is definitely worth all the mess and disturbance

it caused during that time. Likewise, the new area here at the Raven offices

is finally coming to fruition, and I'll be getting all settled in to my very

first real office later today! w00 h00!



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[Tues., Mar. 2, 1999]

We know the natives are getting restless, so we thought we'd give you a word of

assurance.

Right now, the EP is done. <a href="mailto:jsimpson@mail.ravensoft.com">Jake (The Gent) Simpson</a> has finished with the coding

that I observed him working on first-hand yesterday. The EP has been turned

over to QA for one, hopefully final session of bug inspection. But this won't

be a week-long QA thing - although, obviously no one involved is about to

release a buggy EP, which is why this process has gone on as long as it has.

But as you can tell, things are wrapping up, and you should be playing the EP

VERY soon now!



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



[Mon., Mar. 1, 1999]

Hi, my name is William Mull. I'm known online as Phoebus, and my friends and

family call me Bill. In the future, I'll be using my .plan file to help keep you

informed on all the projects we're working on here at Raven. But for whoever's

interested, I'll begin with a quick summary of how I came to work for Raven

Software.



I worked for a year and a half as <a href="http://www.activision.com/">Activision</a>'s Online Production Coordinator.

Three weeks ago today, in fact, I transferred to Madison, WI to work full-time as

<a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/">Raven Software</a>'s Website Administrator. It has been quite a journey from the

time I first discovered computers, which lead to the spark that changed my life,

the first time I played Wolf3D, and when I first successfully connected via modem

with my buddy in Doom. Which lead me to discover Heretic and Hexen when

those games were released. At the time, of course, I had no idea that I would

eventually find myself here at Raven, working for the developers of the games I

truly love the most.



After receiving my undergrad degree in English at the University of Georgia, I

decided to get my Master's in something to do with computers, and decided on

Instructional Technology. Although I earned my Master's degree with honors, I had

already come to the conclusion around the halfway point, that what I really

wanted to do didn't directly involve my course of study in the least. But it did lead

to me teaching myself HTML and becoming consumed with the computer gaming

scene. All of this came at a the right time for me, having played bass guitar in

the late 80's in the local music scene in Athens, GA (Seven Simons, Kilkenny Cats,

and Lotus Eaters). I look back fondly to that ten year period of my life, with lots

of great memories and no regrets. But, I realized that I didn't want to pursue the

proverbial "Rock and Roll Dream" anymore, right around the time I first

discovered computers.



I've been involved with Raven for quite a while now, ever since Hexen II was first

announced on the Net. At that time, I was running my first website, <a href="http://www.phoeb.com/">Cult of

Phoebus</a>. Raven asked me to redesign their site, and I become their webmaster,

which was my first big break in the gaming industry. My next website,

<a href="http://www.hexenworld.com/">HexenWorld</a>, was very much a labor of love. Along with Bakshra, Richard

Connery, Upaboveit, Filth, and other online peers from those very early days of

the fledgling and often-troubled Hexen II scene, I've had the unique pleasure of

helping build from scratch and nurture an entire community.



In addition to helping to develop websites for all of <a href="http://www.activision.com/">Activision</a>'s games, I

continued working on my own to improve Raven's online presence. I have always

been connected and devoted to Raven. When they asked me if I'd be willing to

transfer to Wisconsin and become their Website Administrator - a new position

here, created for and by me - it didn't take me very long to reply in the

affirmative. Now that I'm here, although I'm still getting settled in, I have come

to realize that this is the creative environment I've always dreamed of working in.



If you'd like to get in touch with me, or check out what I've been working on

lately, here is my email auto-sig., which should give you a good idea of the sites

I'm now officially working on for Raven Software:

Thanks to everyone in the community I've come to know and love. Your loyalty

has greatly benefitted myself, the games, and Raven as a company. And I'm very

glad to be here to tell you that. Stay tuned for more great things to come!
