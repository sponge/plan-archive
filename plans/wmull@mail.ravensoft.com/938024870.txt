[Wed., September 22, 1999]

The poem was, of course, a metaphor.

It wasn't meant to be taken as a literal

reference, but however the reader perceived it

based on their own personal experiences. I don't

have or need a mistress in my personal life. I'm

happy to report that my relationship with Laure,

my girlfriend for over a year now, continues to be

a very wonderful, stable aspect of my life.



For those of you who really wanted to know, "My

cruelest mistress" is, in fact, California :-)



This Friday the 24th is officially my last day

at Raven. Quite out of the blue, I received a

few job offers from promiment gaming companies

based in California. After some consideration,

I have accepted a position in northern

California. and I look forward to the new

and exciting opportunities for advancing my

career, and enjoying the atmosphere of

Silicon Valley, bay-bee!



I'm not leaving Raven out of any ill will towards

this great company, nor any of the incredibly

talented people who work here. Thanks to them

for the many great experiences I've had working

for the developer of some of my favorite games.



I'm looking forward to the new challenges my

new job brings, as well as getting back to

California, just in time, as the bitter cold

begins to creep in, here in Wisconsin. :-)



I'll continue to maintain all of the game

sites: <a href="http://www.HexenWorld.com/">HexenWorld</a>, <a href="http://www.HereticII.com/">HereticII.com</a>,

<a href="http://www.Soldier-of-Fortune.com/">Soldier-of-Fortune.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.Raven-Games.com/">Raven-Games.com</a>,

with the involvement of the fans of the game, but

they'll quite naturally revert back to their

previous unofficial status, just as they were

before I came to Raven.



If anyone needs to get in touch with me,

email me at my <a href="mailto:phoebus@hexenworld.com">phoebus@hexenworld.com</a> address.

I'll be sure to get in touch, once I'm all

settled in. Thanks very much! :-)

My cruelest mistress is, oh so lovingly

Awake in my existence. She is calling me

Taunting in the distance, yet so close to me

Shivering from insistence. Pleased to wait for me
