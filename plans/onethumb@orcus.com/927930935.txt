-[ Phantom Menace Adventure game ]-

Threw a little info about the Phantom Menace adventure game on my site
just a minute ago.  It's quite fun.  Check it out if you're interested.

I'm only going to mention game-related website updates in this .plan,
so if you want to hear about other stuff, you'll have to periodically
check yourself.

-[ Microsoft USB keyboards? ]-

Anyone from Microsoft reading these?  We want to try some of the
Microsoft USB keyboards out here, and I have no idea who to contact.  :)

-[ New website open ]-

I like to talk about non-game stuff a lot, but didn't really have a place
to do so.  Well, now I do.  If you're interested in hearing what I
have to say about video games *and* other topics, head on over to my new
website...

It's nothing spectacular, but I just want to spew in some other forum,
since I don't really like how the .plan thing has evolved (and I,
unfortunately, have been a small contributor to the lameness of the general
.plan update.  oh well).

-[ Quake 3: Arena ]-

Just started playing Q3Test 3 or 4 days ago.  Wow!  It's a total blast
and I can't stop playing.  I'm hooked on Q3A like I was never hooked on
Q2.  Kudos to all the id boys (and gals - Hi Miss Donna & Anna :).

However, I'm afraid I suck.  Playing against Paradox and Zor last night,
I think my best score was 9 when the 20 fraglimit was hit.  And if it's
just me and Zor, it gets even worse - I think 3 to 20 or something.  
Yikes!

If you want to beat me down, I often play on the Dallas_Q3T server.

-[ The Lost Adventures of Legend ]-

Anyone have a copy of, or know where I can purchase a copy of, The Lost
Adventures of Legend?  It's by Legend Entertainment, and has Eric the Unready
and 7 of the other classic Legend Entertainment games.

Unfortunately, everyone seems to be sold out.

I really want the box and everything, but I'll settle for just the CD if
no-one can come up with a copy.

Thanks in advance!

-[ Sin LAN Party in Dallas ]-

A local Sin clan (TNT) has spontaneously decided to host a Dallas-area LAN
party.  Needless to say, I'm excited.  :)

Anyone else who's in the area or wants to travel out here for it, check out
their website.
