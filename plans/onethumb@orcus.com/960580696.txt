Hey, any ex-Looking Glass people looking for work, please drop me a line.  I'm
especially interested in programmers, but everyone's welcome.  :)  Loved your 
games, and we're just starting to get off the ground with our game (technology
has been in developement for awhile longer).

The game we're just beginning now is a massively-multiplayer title using some
pretty incredible technology.  Nice salaries, company ownership (a rarity in
the game company world), benefits, the whole nine yards.

Thanks,
Don
