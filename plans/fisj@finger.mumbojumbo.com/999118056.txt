Hey, being a commie (for"eign*er) in the land of opportunity is fun. Some interesting facts I've noticed:

When it rains in california, people inevitably crash and die.
Almost everything is outsized.
Pedestrians seem to be a rare breed, and becoming rarer every season.
Starbucks is an evil domination device, sent from Planet Zorg to take over the planet.
Irvine needs more chicks. (preferably brunettes)
Colour is not spelled like this.

That is all.
