Logitech rules.

	We got a shipment of ifeel mice and Wingman Force 3d joysticks in
last week. I have to say, the ifeel is one kick ass gaming mouse. It has
the ability to vibrate when you play force feedback games as well as
vibrate on the desktop. My first concern was about the vibration during
gameplay, and to my surprise the ifeel stayed accurate even while the
force feedback was kicking in. It is also optical, meaning you get more
precise aiming, and there is no more hassle of trying to clean the dirt
out of it. 

	The Wingman Force 3d is great. It has seven buttons, force
feedback, a hat, throttle control, and the ability to twist left and
right. One small detail that is very nice is the fact that they have the
numbers on the buttons, great for when you're using a custom config in
their profiler. I tried Crimson Skies with this joystick, and I was very
impressed. 


	I have to give some negatives though.  For one the ifeel cannot be
plugged into a usb keyboard because it needs more power then the keyboard
hub can provide. Second is that logitech has no plans to make an optical
version of the Wingman Gaming Mouse. I've been using the Wingman Gaming
Mouse for about two years now, and I think it would blow away any of their
other gaming designs if logitech made it optical. I don't care if it
doesn't have a web wheel, I would still buy it. I don't know that anyone
agrees or disagrees with me, but like always you can email me with what
you think.  

Anyways, back to mappin...
