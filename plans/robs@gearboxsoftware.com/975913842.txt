	ColdSun, long time leader of the quake 1 clan "Rangers" logged off
of irc for the last time tonight. After seven years of fun on the 'net,
ColdSun decided to say goodbye to his friends and the gaming scene for
good. He was one of those old school people who helped change first person
deathmatch forever. As a former member of the Rangers, and as a friend 
I wish ColdSun the best of luck with whatever he  ends up doing, he will
be missed.
