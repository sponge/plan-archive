Hey guys! It's been awhile since the last .plan file, but hey, thats what
happens when you go a few months without a job :) Anyways, I landed a
really good job here at Gearbox. I'm working with a really talented group
of people, and damn this title we're working on is cool. I'm switching
gears after having worked with the Q3 engine, but all is good. I think the
biggest thing for me right now is trying to get the Quake out of my
system and learning the Half Life world. 

On a seperate note, I was reading Bluesnews yesterday and I can't
believe it's been so long since the QW release party in NYC. Blue, we're
getting old... :) However cool that lan party was, I still have to say
that the local lan parties we had in NJ were the greatest. I miss hanging
out with Blue, Esses, Mr. Coffee, Abraxas, and _ArA_ for the weekend and
playing q1 and all sorts of racing games until we couldn't keep our eyes
open. Not even the Qcon 97 Ranger beer tub could beat the fun had at our
NJ lan parties.  


Sigh...
