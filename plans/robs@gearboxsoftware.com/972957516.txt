I'm gonna take one for the team hereM-^â€¦


For the last week or so a few of us here at Gearbox have been having
conversations about which super power, if you could have any, would you
choose. Some of the more common suggestions were invisibility, changing
form, x-ray vision, but we also came up with some really exotic super
powers as well. So now I'm asking anyone who reads this .plan to email me
with your ideas for which super power you would choose if you could chose
one super power. I'll be posting some of the best ones I get later on, so
lets try to be creative here.
