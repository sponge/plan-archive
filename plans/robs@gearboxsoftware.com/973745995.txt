Super power results!!                                          

I've gotten quite a bit of responses to my .plan update about super powers
so I've decided to sort my results out into four categories. Here goes:


Most Common: This one has to go to the ability to 'noclip' or become
nonsolid at a moments notice. Some of the other more common powers we're
mind reading and invisibility.

Most Creative: This one was a tie between 'cinematic music man' who would
have the power to conjure up music form the environment around him at
will, thus changing the mood of any give situation. And 'coordinated
clothing man', able to make the most unpleasant of free t-shirt and
ketchup stained chino combination appear attractive, stylish and bang up
to the minute cool.

Funniest: These for some of the first ones I received, by far the funniest
of the bunch..

Sink: can spawn kitchen sinks at will, but isn't strong enough to do much
with them.

Ball-and-Chain: hero only can use powers while holding wife's hand; side
effect of power is that wife is given turbo-nag powers.

The ability to give people gas just by looking at them.

And last but not least..
The power to keep Windows from crashing while working on an important 
project.

Here are some of the ones that the guys here at Gearbox came up with.

- Always having correct change.
  - Always knowing which line (or queue if you are European) is fastest.
  - Never having to defecate or urinate (unless, as Matt points out,
you'd like to)
  - Being able to fall asleep and wake up exactly when you want to.
  - Being able to make any woman attractive (notice I didn't say
attractED) to you.
  - Being able to control the length of any area of hair.

And of course, the one that kicked this whole thing  off:
  - Venom that's toxic to insects and spiders and the like.
