Today is my last day at Ritual. I've had a very good time here over the last few months and can't thank
everybody here enough for that. They got some really cool stuff coming up, but like so many other ppl in
this industry have done and do I've decided to move on...

The new company I'll be working for is Legend Entertainment, if you haven't heard of them check out their
awesome looking WoT game at http://www.wheeloftime.com.

I'd like to thank everybody who's supported me and Ritual over the past couple of months, especially the
people running fan sites. I'm sure we'll stay in contact, anyway :)
My Ritual email adress should still work for a while, and I can be reached at langsuyar@ocrana.de as always. 

/me vanishes again - you'll probably hear something from me again (if you like it or not ;)) when we got a
game to show you :)
