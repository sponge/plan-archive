7.28.99

Put a few fixes into the current patch (should end up
version 1.7); the elevator bugs (displacing deployables
through floors, and player warping). No more flying
through ceilings with vehicles, a few other misc.
things. JohnA fixed a number of bug's in the scripts,
and the palette problem should addressed (DaveM). The
release notes will have the full list.  We'll hand a
version to QA this afternoon so they can start testing.
I hope this wraps up my TRIBES 1 work for a while.
With the vacation, catching up on all the emails and
the patch fixes, I haven't been doing much on TRIBES 2
work for over a month.

It looks like the TRIBESCon near Seattle is starting
to pick up.  A few few people here are planning on
going, and I'm thinking about tagging along for that
one.  Could be fun :)  (I find it hard to resist
a convention actually named after TRIBES, it's close
proximity doesn't hurt either).

(A correction to my last plan, I misspelled the name
of our beer benefactor, Dyanne Lee,  sorry!).
