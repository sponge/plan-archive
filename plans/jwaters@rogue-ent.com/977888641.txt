OK, since it seems that NOBODY uses the secondary eyestaff attack and EVERYBODY
(even the cheat and hint guides) thinks the second Queen is so goshdarnawful
tough to beat, here's a hint:

USE THE SECONDARY EYESTAFF ATTACK ON THE SECOND QUEEN.

Yay.  The blunderbuss, despite its cool factor, does not have the highest
damage/mana ratio in the game if you start with a full charge.

Since it's Christmas time and since these didn't make it into the cheat book,
a couple more weapon type hints:

o	each boss has a weapon that it's particularly vulnerable to.
o	the secondary eyestaff attack will drop projectiles on each visible
	enemy in sequence.  If you've got 10 guys on screen and 10 projectiles,
	each guy will get blasted on the noggin once.
o	nobody ever uses the secondary icewand ice wall.  Everybody complains 
	about how hard the boss projectile attacks (Jabberwock eyebeam & 
	breath, Red King & Queen1 beam attacks, queen2 projectile attacks)
	are to defend against.  Somebody should try the icewall against them.
o	at the entrance to the tweedle fight (where the three swinging pipes
	are) there's that one clockwork automaton that is mostly out of range
	or difficult to hit.  If you've got the jacks, the secondary jacks 
	attack will knock his ass into the mercury.
o	tweedles burn good.


That's OK tho, because nobody knows I work at Rogue so my .plan file isn't
mirrored anywhere.

Merry Christmas.  Don't get hit by a bus.  If you haven't yet, buy Alice.
It's fancy.

Don't get all excited, I'm not really a big .plan guy.  But I figured I should
put something here since everybody else does.  I actually started at Rogue
last month, but things have been busy and I just now got around to logging
into the unix box to set up my file, so there.

For any crazy game-developer-stalker folks, I might as well help you start 
your dossier: I'm currently a software engineer at Rogue working on American 
McGee's Alice.  Prior to that (at still, to some extent) I ran a small 
independent game development house out of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  We shipped 
one title (back in February
'98) and had another couple in development.  I still provide technical
support for the shipping product, but the other projects are on indefinite 
hold until I decide what to do with them.  One is pretty close to completion,
so I could theoretically finish it during my piles of "spare time", but so
far that's amounted to about 2 nights of work in the last month that I've been
here.

On my primary home machine, Linux is my friend.  It should be yours too.

I picked up Digital Anvil's Starlancer and poked around with it for an hour or
so today (about as much as I get to play any game -- now it'll sit on my HD
for 2 months until I eventually take it off and acknowledge that I don't get to
play *anything* but what I'm working on for more than a few minutes).  It's
pretty.  I like it.  Hope I get a chance to play some more.
