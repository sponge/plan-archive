Wednesday, October 1st, 2003 - Kenn is officially old today...
Yep, that's right.  Today Kenn is thirty years OLD.  Kenn is 
now also talking about himself in the third person.

Hard to believe I was 23 when I started at Raven.  Where the
hell has all the time gone?  *sigh*

Wednesday, September 10th, 2003 - Anyone know where I can
find a copy of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061386/">Batman Fights Dracula</a> on video?

I need this for a friend of mine who will positively flip
out if I can find it for him.

If you have any leads (other than Ebay, I checked) then
please <a href="mailto:khoekstra@ravensoft.com?subject=Batman Fights Dracula">drop me a line</a>.

Rock on!

Tuesday, August 5th, 2003 - Non work-related update today...
Green Bay Packers fans unite!  Please sign <a href="http://www.southendzone.com/savelambeau/getinvolved/">this petition</a> to 
save the Lambeau Field name!

I'd sure hate to see Green Bay play in Velveeta Stadium, or
worse yet...Velveeta Cheese Presents...The Green Bay Packers!

Your support is appreciated...

Monday, July 14th, 2003 - Just a warning about a SOF2 CD Key
scam that's going on right now...  Some guy calling himself
"John Novak" is e-mailing people from a hotmail account and
claiming to be from Raven Software.  He's claiming that we
(Raven) are gathering defective keys for replacement and asking 
that you e-mail him your CD Key.

DON'T FALL FOR THIS SCAM!  In fact, DON'T SHARE YOUR CD KEY
WITH ANYONE!  No one from Raven will ever contact you and 
ask you for your CD key.  If we do, it's only if you
contact us first through our website with a tech support 
request. 

Feel free to <a href="mailto:raven_softwaresof2@hotmail.com">e-mail this guy</a> and let him know what you
think of his little scam.  ;)

Another thing to beware of, if you're not already aware of
this, is to watch out for buying used games on Ebay (or
anywhere else for that matter) that require CD keys.  I've
seen many people sell their game who continue using the 
key after the sale.  This causes no end of trouble
for the buyer and unfortunately we can't issue new keys for 
used games. Buyer beware...

That is all.

Wednesday, June 25th, 2003 - It's been a while since my
last update and I'm not even sure our finger server is
still working, so this is a bit of a test. At first
glance, our .plan tracker appears to be hosed... 

I've updated the much outdated <a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/getajob.htm">"Get A Job In The Industry"</a>
page.  Mainly I fixed all of the broken links and
added a few new sections regarding gaming universities
and other new wave things.  Wheeee....

Raven is also still looking for a High Poly Modeler for
Quake IV.  Get the details <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/jobs.html">here</a>.

Oh, and I've re-launched my website at <a href="http://www.kennhoekstra.com">http://www.kennhoekstra.com</a>.

More later...

IN LOVING MEMORY - Kenneth Lee Hoekstra (August 26th, 1937 - April 23rd, 1998)

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
