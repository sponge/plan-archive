Thursday, August 16th, 2001 - Soldier of Fortune Platinum
Edition has Gone Gold!  Or...um...Platinum, as the case
may be.  Soldier of Fortune Platinum is:

- Soldier of Fortune Full Retail Game
- Gold Edition Maps/Mods/Enhancements
- 1.07f Patch Adding GameSpy Support To Multiplayer
- 5 New Multiplayer Maps
- Brady Games Strategy Guide (penned by me) In .pdf Format
- Preview Trailer of Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix

This edition of the game is meant for those who haven't
purchased Soldier of Fortune in any form to date.  As with
the Gold Edition, the Platinum Edition updates and features
will be freely available for download soon to those of you
who own Soldier of Fortune or Soldier of Fortune Gold.  

As soon as the Platinum Pack is available for download, 
I'll send out an announcement and make an update here.

If you want to order Soldier of Fortune Platinum, you can
do so through the <a href="http://store.activision.com/dr/v2/Ec_Main.entry24?SP=10023&PN=1&V1=332590&xid=9685&search_id=4769012&doc_id=3&DSP=&CUR=840&CACHE_ID=0">Activision Store here</a> for a mere $29.99.

*************************************************************

August 7th, 2001 - I’m off to QuakeCon. I’ll be showing SoF2
at the Activision booth all weekend with guest appearances by
Rick Johnson, Brian Raffel and Jim Hughes. Hopefully I’ll 
actually get to SEE some of the events going on. 

As it turns out, LucasArts and Activision will be showing 
the E3 demo of Jedi Knight 2 at QuakeCon. Check in at 
<a href="http://www.quakecon.org">Quakecon.org</a> for more information as it is available.

See you there...

**************************************************************

August 3rd, 2001 - Just wanted to send out thanks and congrats
to Crave Entertainment for the superb job they did making 
<a href=" http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=184388&mscssid=&ref=1&PromoCode=&site=&siteID=">Soldier of Fortune for the DreamCast</a>.  When they sent us an 
advanced copy of the game and we checked it out in our main 
conference room, some of us (myself included) nearly shed the
proverbial "single manly tear."  It's a fine translation of 
a PC game to a console format.  Great job, guys!

************************************************************

July 26th, 2001 - Almost a month since my last update...  Is
that some sort of record?  I think it just may be!  ;)

I've been working on finishing up the script for Soldier of
Fortune 2: Double Helix.  It's going well...  I just need to
add dialogue for the tutorial mission, add a few more generic
phrases and make up some guard conversations for the Hong Kong
and Kamchatka missions.  Should be ready to go soon, on track
for voice recording at the end of August.  Yay!  

We just finished up our builds of SoF2 and JK2 for upcoming
trade shows like Activate and QuakeCon.  I guess Raven won't
be at GenCon this year, though.  Bummer...  =(

I'm headed to QuakeCon this year, by the way...  It will be my 
first ever trip there.  Rick Johnson and I will be showing Soldier 
of Fortune 2, so stop by and say "hi" if you're in the 
neighborhood.  No word yet on whether or not JK2 will be making 
an appearance at QuakeCon, so don't ask.  LucasArts still hasn't 
made that call yet.  I'm sure they'll make an announcement if they
decide to attend...

Raven just ordered 21 new Dell PCs...P4 1.7GHZ with 512 MB RAM
and GeForce3 cards.  I'm setting them all up now.  I wish I 
could say it was fun, but I think there's a special ring of hell
reserved for people who set up PCs.  I'm there now...  ;)

More later...maybe next month.  If you're bored, I've also found
time to re-launch the <a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/users/khoekstra/">"Kenn's World"</a> website.  Just a skeleton
right now, but maybe someday it will be cool...

Rock and roll!

July 6th, 2001 - The long-awaited 1.07 patch for Soldier of 
Fortune is here!  The patch removes WON support from the game 
and exchanges it for GameSpy browser support.  (CD Keys no 
longer required to play online)  There are also a number of other 
minor bug fixes included.

This patch requires that Soldier of Fortune be patched up to 1.06, 
first, which means if you have the Soldier of Fortune Gold Edition, 
this is the only patch you need.  If you have the standard Soldier 
of Fortune, you need the <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/?file_id=116666">1.06 Gold Patch</a> first and then this one.

- <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com">1.07 Patch Download (Approx: 2MB) at FilePlanet</a> (Free Registration Required)
- <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/?file_id=149506">1.07 Patch Download Mirror at 3DDownloads</a>

Enjoy!

June 22nd, 2001 - All this talk of Quake's five-year anniversary
reminded me that this Sunday is Raven Software's eleven-year
anniversary!  In 1990, five men and one computer in a basement 
started Raven Software with a vision: to create an RPG for the
Amiga.  That game was Black Crypt.  Eleven years and fourteen 
titles later, Raven Software has expanded to more than 50 
employees and is working on not one, but three game titles.
Pretty cool stuff...

Congrats to Brian and Steve Raffel and all of the "old timers"
who've been here longer than I have.  I'm looking forward to 
the next eleven years. 

On a personal note, my ten-year high-school class reunion
is this weekend.  Big fun, big prizes, big danger...  =)

Wish me luck!  Have a great weekend, everyone.

Wednesday, May 26th, 1999 - A new day has dawned in Kenn's World...  Last night, I
asked Michele, the love of my life, to marry me.  And she said YES!  Thank you, Michele...
You've made me the happiest man in the world!  I look forward to spending the rest of
my life with you...  You are the most wonderful person I have ever known...

Thanks to Rob "Beroge" Gee for ring shopping with me and special thanks to 
Kim "Lee Majors" Lathrop for giving me the final "get in there, son...we need
a base runner" speech.  =)  Oh...and thanks to 94.1 WJJO for playing "Rainbow In The Dark"
during my drive to "the big moment."  I couldn't have done it without all of your help...

Hey Matt!  You're next, buddy...  In the immortal words of "Nature Boy" Ric Flair....WHOOOOOOOOO!

IN LOVING MEMORY - Kenneth Lee Hoekstra (August 26th, 1937 - April 23rd, 1998)

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
