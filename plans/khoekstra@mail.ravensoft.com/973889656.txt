Friday, November 10th, 2000 - Well, I'm back for good and
the wedding was a blast!  The biggest adjustment?  Typing
with a ring on my left ring finger...  *laughs*  Other than
that, things are peachy and married life is grand.  =) I'm
all caught up on the unbelievable amount of e-mails I 
received, too.  Sorry if anyone had to wait too long for a
response.  Thanks for your patience...  I hope to post some
wedding pictures soon!  Stay tuned...

As you probably read, we just released the Hexen II Source
Code!  You can read the <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/announcements.shtml">announcement here</a> and grab the
<a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/showfile.php3?file_id=107009">source code here</a>.

As far as the Presidential election goes, how's this for
<a href="http://evilavatar.com/EA/News/M15830/pictures.htm?imgID=2300">funny</a>?  <a href="http://evilavatar.com/EA/News/M15830/pictures.htm?imgID=2301">Or this?</a>? =)  Now that it's over, I can tell 
you that I voted for George W. Bush.  At this point, though, 
I don't care who wins.  I just hope one of them is man enough 
to step down and let the country (and the stock market) move 
on...  Nixon did it...Al or G.W. should, too.

My two (or three) cents...

Monday, November 6th, 2000 - Though I'm not due back to
work until Wednesday, I felt it was important to come in
and make this update:

Tomorrow is election day.  George W. Bush and Al Gore 
are running for President of the United States and it's 
time to get out and vote.  There are also numerous other 
state and federal offices up for grabs and your vote DOES 
make a difference.  The Presidential race is especially 
important because the winning candidate will likely shape 
the face of the law for the next forty years with his 
selection of several Supreme Court Justices.  The latest
polls show a dead heat this election, so now more than
ever your vote can make a big difference.

Many men and women have fought and died over the years for 
your right to vote and you should honor them by exercising 
that right.  It's a simple thing that takes very little
time.  Just do it...

I'd love to use this forum as an opportunity to endorse a
candidate, but I won't.  I'd rather point you to some
resources to read more about each candidate so you can 
make an informed decision.  Here are the most useful
sites on the 'net that I've seen so far:

* <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com">GeorgeWBush.com</a>
* <a href="http://www.algore.com">AlGore.com</a>
* <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/resources/where.they.stand/">Where The Candidates Stand On The Issues</a>
* <a href="http://www.mtv.com/nav/intro_chooseorlose.html">Choose Or Lose</a>
* <a href="http://www.rockthevote.com">RockTheVote.com</a>

Thanks for listening...  Get out there and VOTE!!!!

Friday, October 27th, 2000 - This is my last .plan update
as a "free man."  I'll be off next week to get married on
a cruise down in the Virgin Islands.  Michele and I are
tying the knot on Halloween in St. Thomas.  As a result,
I will not be back at Raven until November 7th.  

Take care, everyone.  I'll talk to you all when I get back...
All the best,

--Kenn

Tuesday, October 24th, 2000 - As you may have noted in
James Monroe's .plan file, the Elite Force Dedicated
Linux Server is <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/showfile.php3?file_id=103589">available for download over at 3DDownloads</a>.

RE: Joystick Code in Elite Force

Many joystick users complained about the joystick code in the 
Elite Force demo, so we changed it for the full version.
Now the joystick users who weren't complaining are complaining 
about the new joystick code and configuration options.  The 
solution?  The upcoming patch for Elite Force will allow users 
to choose between the demo setup and the original full version 
setup.  This should solve a lot of the problems that you've
been having.  We sent the patch to Activision for QA testing,
but I have no idea when we're going to release it.  Thank you
for not asking...  Maybe now both sides can be happy?  =)

I noticed in this week's Best Buy circular that they're having
a huge sale on KISS - Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child!  You
can get the full version for $9.99 and the Collector's Edition
(which I highly recommend) for a mere $17.99.  This is a solid
first-person shooter and I recommend grabbing it if you don't
own it already.  I'll be grabbing another CE tonight...

Only 7 more days until my wedding.  And they say the only 
thing we have to fear is fear itself...  *laughs*

Tuesday, October 17th, 2000 - Well, all the "T's" have been
crossed and the "I's" have been dotted.  The Mac port of 
Elite Force is a done deal.  Check out <a href="http://www.westlakeinteractive.com/news0175.html">this press release</a>
from Westlake Interactive.  The Mac port is being developed
by <a href="http://www.aspyr.com">Aspyr Media</a> and they're in production now.  I don't know
when it will be ready to ship, but it is in the works.

It's nice to finally be able to "officially" announce 
something once legal does its thing.  =)

On another, completely unrelated note, I am convinced that
judgment day is upon us.  In the immortal words of Indiana
Jones: "Don't look, Marion.  Keep your eyes shut!"  Can
you believe a film studio <a href="http://ramhurl.film.com/smildemohurl.ram?file=filmcom/media/trailers/2000/rv8/vampi_newli_trail_176x132_vss100.rm">would do this to vampires</a>? 
(Note: RealPlayer required to view "the horror.")

I've lost all faith in the human condition...  =(

Tuesday, April 18th, 2000 - For those of you having trouble finding
Soldier of Fortune in Canada, check out <a href="http://www.dragon.ca">this site</a>.  Here you can
find <a href="http://www.dragon.ca/games/action/soldieroffortune.htm">SoF for a reasonable price</a> and, more importantly, with a reasonable
shipping cost.  If you're interested, you can also <a href="http://www.dragon.ca/games/adventure/starvoyagereliteforce.htm">pre-order Elite Force</a>.

As Brian Raffel pointed out in his .plan, you can e-mail John F. Mullins
at <a href="mailto:johnfmullins@hotmail.com">johnfmullins@hotmail.com</a> if you'd like to say a few words to  
our illustrious Soldier of Fortune consultant.

In addition, you can receive an autographed copy of John F. Mullins' book
"Days of Fire," a novel of the Vietnam War by sending $6.00 (U.S currency
and shipments only please) to:

Buford Books
PMB 105
1509 N. Main
Altus, OK  73521

I guess that's enough .plan p1mpage for one day...  Back to the grind
of Elite Force.  Expect big things soon...

Wednesday, May 26th, 1999 - A new day has dawned in Kenn's World...  Last night, I
asked Michele, the love of my life, to marry me.  And she said YES!  Thank you, Michele...
You've made me the happiest man in the world!  I look forward to spending the rest of
my life with you...  You are the most wonderful person I have ever known...

Thanks to Rob "Beroge" Gee for ring shopping with me and special thanks to 
Kim "Lee Majors" Lathrop for giving me the final "get in there, son...we need
a base runner" speech.  =)  Oh...and thanks to 94.1 WJJO for playing "Rainbow In The Dark"
during my drive to "the big moment."  I couldn't have done it without all of your help...

Hey Matt!  You're next, buddy...  In the immortal words of "Nature Boy" Ric Flair....WHOOOOOOOOO!

IN LOVING MEMORY - Kenneth Lee Hoekstra (August 26th, 1937 - April 23rd, 1998)

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
