On a work-related note, Raven is looking to hire:

2D/3D Texture and World Model Artist Position for Quake 4:

Raven is looking for a 2-D/3-D artist to concept, build, and

low-poly model building in Lightwave or Maya. 

We will require a resume and samples of your texture and 
world models on disc or on a viewable online site. Examples 
of your modeling prowess is needed, too. Send all resumes 
and samples to Kevin Long at <a href="mailto:klong@ravensoft.com?subject=Quake IV Art Position">klong@ravensoft.com</a> or mail them to:

Monday, February 17th, 2003 - Anyone have a line on a
good corporate SPAM filter?  We were using X-Wall, which
was working fantastically well, but we were losing some
legit mail in the process.  Now we're exploring our 
options again for some new software...  

We're using MS Exchange 5.X, if that helps.  Thanks 
for any insight into our little problem.  If you've
got something, <a href="mailto:khoekstra@ravensoft.com?subject=New Spam Software">e-mail me here</a>.

I left for two days and had 500 SPAM e-mails in my inbox.
That's up a bit from the 5 or so that were getting through
when we had our X-Wall turned on.  *sigh*

asked Michele, the love of my life, to marry me.  And she said YES!  Thank you, Michele...
You've made me the happiest man in the world!  I look forward to spending the rest of
my life with you...  You are the most wonderful person I have ever known...

Thanks to Rob "Beroge" Gee for ring shopping with me and special thanks to 
Kim "Lee Majors" Lathrop for giving me the final "get in there, son...we need
a base runner" speech.  =)  Oh...and thanks to 94.1 WJJO for playing "Rainbow In The Dark"

Hey Matt!  You're next, buddy...  In the immortal words of "Nature Boy" Ric Flair....WHOOOOOOOOO!

IN LOVING MEMORY - Kenneth Lee Hoekstra (August 26th, 1937 - April 23rd, 1998)

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
