Tuesday, April 2nd, 2002 - I'm headed out to San Francisco for
a Soldier of Fortune 2 press event and then I'll be on vacation
from April 5th through the 15th.  I have my out of office assistant
turned on, so if you e-mail me, you'll get the scoop on what to
do and where to go for assistance.  See you when I get back!

Thursday, March 28th, 2002 - I just pre-ordered my collector's
edition of Jedi Outcast from EBWorld.  In most cases, it's $59.99
but EBWorld has a painless $10 mail-in rebate.  Not bad!  One of
the guys bought a collector's edition today and I must say it's
pretty sweet stuff.  You can get one <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=216704">here</a>.

I haven't had chance to put together a FAQ yet for Jedi Outcast
but here are some support tips for you right off the bat:

1. If you get the "Could Not Open GL Subsystem" error, it's 
because either your video card isn't 100% open GL compatible
or because you need new drivers.  If you have any card released
in the last two years (GeForce anything, Radeon etc.) and you
get the error, it's driver related.  For a great list of drivers,
check out: <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/hw/Binaries/drivers.html">http://www.voodooextreme.com/hw/Binaries/drivers.html</a>.

2. I've seen some performance-related issues pop up on the
message boards as well.  The most likely cause of this is the
tendency of people to crank things up as high as they will go
just because they can.  Don't worry, I do this too...  My
recommendations for improving performance in Jedi Outcast:

a) Update all of your video, sound and directX drivers to
make sure you have the latest, greatest versions.  There's a
list of all supported hardware as well as the tested drivers in
C:Program FilesLucasArtsStar Wars JK II Jedi OutcastInstall	rouble.rtf

b) Turn off all background applications including e-mail, ICQ,
and especially virus scanners.  Some virus scanners really do
check everything and this can kill load times and performance.

c) Don't play in resolutions higher than 800X600 on anything
short of "uber hardware."  JK2 is a hardware intensive game and
if you crank everything as high as it will go, you can overheat
your video card and/or your processor.  That will cause lock-ups
and performance problems.  Taking the side of the case off for
extra ventilation is another option to avoid this.  Be careful
with AMD machines, though.  Sometimes taking the case off makes
matters worse depending on how ventilation is set up.

3. Load times...  I've seen some people mentioning problems with
load times.  The key here is to be objective in analyzing your
system's capabilities before cranking everything up.  To check
this, we did the following test analysis:

All tests were run from the release copy, and dropping out of the 
executable and re-running for each graphic setting change (and 
waiting for any hard drive accessing to cease before starting next 
test). The only settings we altered were choosing the 4 predefined 
video settings at the top of the video screen. Nothing else was 
touched at all.

All tests stopwatched from console command "map kejim_base" to 
seeing "datapad updated" onscreen.

P3 / 1GHZ / 512MB / GeForce3 64MB

VideoSetting	Load time	Reload Time (same timing method)
=================================================
HighQuality	1:15		0:04
Normal		0:38		0:04
Fast		0:31		0:03
Fastest		0:29		0:03

P2 / 300MHZ / 128MB / TNT1 16MB  (low-end machine, but for comparison)

HighQuality	6:00		0:55	
Normal		2:55		0:42
Fast		1:52		0:20
Fastest		1:45		0:15

Ram is the biggest helper for load times as is video memory.
If you have 256MB of RAM or more and a 32MB or 64MB video
card, load times shouldn't be an issue at all.

If I see any other issues, I'll try to address them.  In the
meantime, Jedi Outcast has some of the most comprehensive help
files and diagnostic tools I've ever seen in a game, courtesy
of Activision and LucasArts.  Use them!  You can find the help
files in: C:Program FilesLucasArtsStar Wars JK II Jedi OutcastInstall
and as part of the launcher screen.

If you have issues, be sure to visit "Yoda's Help Desk" over at
LucasArts.com as they are handling support for the game.  I will
try to put support things here and I plan to make a FAQ soon to
collect all of the info.  I'll keep you posted.  In the meantime,
<a href="http://support.lucasarts.com">http://support.lucasarts.com</a> is the place to go!

Thanks for the outpouring of positive feedback we've gotten so
far!  I'm glad everyone is enjoying the game!

Sunday, February 3rd, 2002 - Today is my Five Year Anniversary
with Raven Software.  Five years ago today I started work with
a PPRO 200 with 128 MB of RAM and a 2GB hard drive with a copy
of Windows 95 and 3D Studio Max 1.2.  I'd never seen the real
Internet before, only muds and a vax at UW-Whitewater. 

A month or so after I started, Jon Zuk and I got Monster 3D 
Voodoo1 cards from Best Buy and proceeded to put colored lighting 
into a Raven title for the first time.  God, has it been that 
long?  I can hardly believe it...

At that time, we were working on Take No Prisoners, MageSlayer
and Hexen II for Red Orb, GT Interactive and Activision.  Raven 
consisted of about 25 people, all of which actually fit around 
the table and in the chairs of our main conference room.

In the five years since I started, I've watched the building
expand twice and the team expand to 60 people.  We released
those three games we were working on, were bought by Activision
and we went on to produce Portal of Praevus, Heretic II, Soldier 
of Fortune (+Gold and Platinum), Elite Force, Elite Force Expansion 
Pack and we're closing in on the completion of Jedi Outcast and 
Soldier 2 with two more titles waiting in the wings.  

My machine today has upgraded by 10 times the MHZ, 3 processors, 4 
times the RAM, 40 times the hard drive space, 16 times the video 
memory, four versions of MAX and five or six OS's.

I had just watched the Packers beat the Patriots in Superbowl XXXI
and now, five years later, I'm about to go home and watch another
Superbowl (featuring the Patriots, no less).

It's been a good five years.  Here's looking at five more...

Friday, January 4th, 2002 - Happy New Year!  

Thanks for the Windows XP help!  Several people sent me this link
to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/howtobuy/choosing2.asp">comparison between XP Home and XP Professional</a>.
Apparently I'm either too lazy or too slow to find things
like this on Microsoft's home page.  :)

Rock and roll!

Oh...and if you have a moment, check out <a href="http://www.thundarr.com">Thundarr.com</a>.

My New Year's Resolution to achieve total fanboy geekdom, I'm 
happy to say, was a smashing success.  :)

*************************************************************





Saturday, December 15th, 2001 - For someone who doesn't like
travel, I sure end up traveling quite a bit...  ;)  Yes, I'll
be out in L.A. for the next five days.  If you e-mail me, I'll
get back to you in the order the mail was received.  Thanks 
for your patience.

Saw this <a href="http://actionvault.ign.com/features/intelligence/sof2.shtml">interesting summation of Soldier of Fortune II</a> the
other day...  It's pretty cool!  A nice, comprehensive overview
of just about every aspect of the game.  

My favorite line of the article is this one: 

"Project Administrator Kenn Hoekstra has repeatedly stated that 
winter is when the game is expected to be complete. More recently, 
Lead Programmer Rick Johnson has given a release date of the first 
quarter of 2002."

What people don't realize is that in Wisconsin, the first quarter 
of 2002 is still "Winter."  ;) I've got something in my head that
Obi Wan once said...  Something about a "certain point of view?"
Heh...  Anyway, I thought it was kind of funny.  

Thanks, by the way, for signing my <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/thundarr/petition.html">"Bring Thundarr To DVD"</a>
petition.  Thundarr.com is coming soon...  Muwahahahaha!

Have a great weekend, peeps.

Thursday, December 13th, 2001 - Nothing work-related today.
I just want to say that I'm about to embark on the biggest
geek-mission of my 28 year long geek life.  I'm in the
process of securing a domain name and server setup for my
first ever fanboy Internet page dedicated to... <drumroll> 
THUNDARR THE BARBARIAN!  

Yes, that's right.  It was one of my fave cartoons as a kid 
(along with other gems like Spider Man and his Amazing Friends, 
He-Man and Thundercats) and I'm disappointed that there's 
so little information about it on the Internet.  I want to
create THE comprehensive place to go for Thundarr info.  I'm
also bitter that there's no way to get the series on video
or DVD anymore.  I contacted Ruby-Spears Entertainment about
it and they told me the rights belong to AOL/Time Warner and
the Cartoon Network.  Surprise!  They don't accept any input
or suggestions through their websites, so there's no way for
me to even SUGGEST they put it out on DVD.

So, to make a long story short, stay tuned for my Thundarr
haven on the web.  First up is going to be a petition to
release all 21 episodes of its glory on DVD.  And I expect
each and every one of you to <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/thundarr/petition.html">SIGN THIS BAD BOY!</a> ;)

It will be one of the corner stones of the site...  Stay
tuned for more geek info and a geek link to Kenn's geek
page.  :)  Thanks for signing, if you sign...

Take care,

--Kenn

Wednesday, November 21st, 2001 - I guess it's been a while
since I last updated so I have a bit to catch up on.  Let's
get started, shall we?

First of all, the official <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/outcast/">Jedi Outcast website</a> is live over
at LucasArts.com.  The content there coupled with last night's
<a href="http://www.mgon.com/articles.phtml?id=112760">Jedi Outcast chat transcript</a> should go a long way in answering
most questions people have about the game.  In the coming weeks
and months we'll be beefing up the content of the website, 
updating the FAQ and grabbing commonly asked questions from
various message boards to answer and add to the FAQ.

As you're probably aware, Soldier of Fortune II is now going
to ship with multiplayer.  We released some screenshots the
other day to accompany the <a href="http://www.stomped.com/published/big1006198921_1_1.html">press release</a>.  Most websites only
carried five of them but you can see <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/screenshots/games/sof2/20011119/">all eight here</a> if you're
interested.  We're really excited to be able to offer single 
player, the random scenario generator and now multiplayer.  

Congrats to id, Gray Matter, Nerve and Activision for finishing
and shipping Wolfenstein!  Nothing says "we're gold" like women
in spike heels and leather pants sitting on a pile of gold bars.
That's what I always say...  ;)  

Oh, and congrats to "the Romero" and Co. on their <a href="http://www.monkeystone.com/news.php">new digs</a>...

Other non-work stuff:

I know I've talked about quitting smoking here in the ol' .plan
before at least twice.  Well, this time I mean it.  I'm five
days into quitting using a little thing called Zyban to help
me.  So far, so good.  I may have finally exorcised the demon.  ;)

Raven took us to see Harry Potter yesterday.  It was pretty good.
Not surprisingly, however, the book is much better.  Sadly, there's 
only so much you can do with a movie.  I wonder what all of the
smiling parents at the theater would think if someone told them
that Harry Potter is basically *gasp* a Dungeons & Dragons module?
If they knew that, they'd probably be just like <a href="http://www.exposingsatanism.org/harrypotter.htm">these people</a>.  Huh?

I picked up the KISS boxed set yesterday.  Even if you're a RABID
KISS fan I'd recommend against the "collector's edition" of the 
set.  I don't think a cheesy guitar case and a hardcover version of
the cd book is worth a hundred bucks.  The regular edition, however,
is worth the $50.  The thirty unreleased songs are quite cool.  

I'm going to ask Santa for a GameCube this Christmas.  I'm very
much looking forward to Resident Evil, some incarnation of the
Metroid series and the other games that are due out soon.  I think
the GC looks solid all around.  I think it's the system that will
make me break my console draught of three years...

Okay, I guess I've droned on long enough.  Have a happy Thanksgiving!
Back to work on manual stuff etc. etc. etc.

Friday, December 22nd, 2000 - I posted an article that I

Wednesday, May 26th, 1999 - A new day has dawned in Kenn's World...  Last night, I
asked Michele, the love of my life, to marry me.  And she said YES!  Thank you, Michele...
You've made me the happiest man in the world!  I look forward to spending the rest of
my life with you...  You are the most wonderful person I have ever known...

Thanks to Rob "Beroge" Gee for ring shopping with me and special thanks to 
Kim "Lee Majors" Lathrop for giving me the final "get in there, son...we need
a base runner" speech.  =)  Oh...and thanks to 94.1 WJJO for playing "Rainbow In The Dark"
during my drive to "the big moment."  I couldn't have done it without all of your help...

Hey Matt!  You're next, buddy...  In the immortal words of "Nature Boy" Ric Flair....WHOOOOOOOOO!

IN LOVING MEMORY - Kenneth Lee Hoekstra (August 26th, 1937 - April 23rd, 1998)

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
