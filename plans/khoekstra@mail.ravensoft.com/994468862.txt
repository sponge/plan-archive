July 6th, 2001 - The long-awaited 1.07 patch for Soldier of 
Fortune is here!  The patch removes WON support from the game 
and exchanges it for GameSpy browser support.  (CD Keys no 
longer required to play online)  There are also a number of other 
minor bug fixes included.

This patch requires that Soldier of Fortune be patched up to 1.06, 
first, which means if you have the Soldier of Fortune Gold Edition, 
this is the only patch you need.  If you have the standard Soldier 
of Fortune, you need the <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/?file_id=116666">1.06 Gold Patch</a> first and then this one.

June 22nd, 2001 - All this talk of Quake's five-year anniversary
reminded me that this Sunday is Raven Software's eleven-year
anniversary!  In 1990, five men and one computer in a basement 
started Raven Software with a vision: to create an RPG for the
Amiga.  That game was Black Crypt.  Eleven years and fourteen 
titles later, Raven Software has expanded to more than 50 
employees and is working on not one, but three game titles.
Pretty cool stuff...

Congrats to Brian and Steve Raffel and all of the "old timers"
who've been here longer than I have.  I'm looking forward to 
the next eleven years. 

On a personal note, my ten-year high-school class reunion
is this weekend.  Big fun, big prizes, big danger...  =)

Wish me luck!  Have a great weekend, everyone.

Wednesday, May 26th, 1999 - A new day has dawned in Kenn's World...  Last night, I
asked Michele, the love of my life, to marry me.  And she said YES!  Thank you, Michele...
You've made me the happiest man in the world!  I look forward to spending the rest of
my life with you...  You are the most wonderful person I have ever known...

Thanks to Rob "Beroge" Gee for ring shopping with me and special thanks to 
Kim "Lee Majors" Lathrop for giving me the final "get in there, son...we need
a base runner" speech.  =)  Oh...and thanks to 94.1 WJJO for playing "Rainbow In The Dark"
during my drive to "the big moment."  I couldn't have done it without all of your help...

Hey Matt!  You're next, buddy...  In the immortal words of "Nature Boy" Ric Flair....WHOOOOOOOOO!

IN LOVING MEMORY - Kenneth Lee Hoekstra (August 26th, 1937 - April 23rd, 1998)

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
