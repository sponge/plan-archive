Wednesday, November 21st, 2001 - I guess it's been a while
since I last updated so I have a bit to catch up on.  Let's
get started, shall we?

First of all, the official <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/outcast/">Jedi Outcast website</a> is live over
at LucasArts.com.  The content there coupled with last night's
<a href="http://www.mgon.com/articles.phtml?id=112760">Jedi Outcast chat transcript</a> should go a long way in answering
most questions people have about the game.  In the coming weeks
and months we'll be beefing up the content of the website, 
updating the FAQ and grabbing commonly asked questions from
various message boards to answer and add to the FAQ.

As you're probably aware, Soldier of Fortune II is now going
to ship with multiplayer.  We released some screenshots the
other day to accompany the <a href="http://www.stomped.com/published/big1006198921_1_1.html">press release</a>.  Most websites only
carried five of them but you can see <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/screenshots/games/sof2/20011119/">all eight here</a> if you're
interested.  We're really excited to be able to offer single 
player, the random scenario generator and now multiplayer.  

Congrats to id, Gray Matter, Nerve and Activision for finishing
and shipping Wolfenstein!  Nothing says "we're gold" like women
in spike heels and leather pants sitting on a pile of gold bars.
That's what I always say...  ;)  

Oh, and congrats to "the Romero" and Co. on their <a href="http://www.monkeystone.com/news.php">new digs</a>...

Other non-work stuff:

I know I've talked about quitting smoking here in the ol' .plan
before at least twice.  Well, this time I mean it.  I'm five
days into quitting using a little thing called Zyban to help
me.  So far, so good.  I may have finally exorcised the demon.  ;)

Raven took us to see Harry Potter yesterday.  It was pretty good.
Not surprisingly, however, the book is much better.  Sadly, there's 
only so much you can do with a movie.  I wonder what all of the
smiling parents at the theater would think if someone told them
that Harry Potter is basically *gasp* a Dungeons & Dragons module?
If they knew that, they'd probably be just like <a href="http://www.exposingsatanism.org/harrypotter.htm">these people</a>.  Huh?

I picked up the KISS boxed set yesterday.  Even if you're a RABID
KISS fan I'd recommend against the "collector's edition" of the 
set.  I don't think a cheesy guitar case and a hardcover version of
the cd book is worth a hundred bucks.  The regular edition, however,
is worth the $50.  The thirty unreleased songs are quite cool.  

I'm going to ask Santa for a GameCube this Christmas.  I'm very
much looking forward to Resident Evil, some incarnation of the
Metroid series and the other games that are due out soon.  I think
the GC looks solid all around.  I think it's the system that will
make me break my console draught of three years...

Okay, I guess I've droned on long enough.  Have a happy Thanksgiving!
Back to work on manual stuff etc. etc. etc.

Wednesday, October 31st, 2001 - Happy Halloween, everybody!
My favorite holiday is finally here.  Not only is it a time
for costumes and candy, it's also my wedding anniversary!  I
can't believe it's been a year already...  Time really flies
these days.  Happy Anniversary, Michele! ;) 

Back to work...

*************************************************************

Monday, October 1st, 2001 - Thanks to everyone who sent in
their Hollywood screenwriting suggestions.  I got quite a bit
of useful information and am most grateful for it.

On a more personal note, today is my 28th birthday.  Only two
more years before I update the list of things I want to 
accomplish before age 30 to "things to accomplish before I 
die."  ;)

Back to work on Soldier 2 mission objectives, manual and 
documentation goodness...

*************************************************************



Wednesday, September 26th, 2001 - I just finished compiling a 
list of all of the Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix info I
could find on the Internet.  If you're interested in seeing a
list of everything that's available, you can <a href="http://sof2.ravensoft.com/press.html">check it out here</a>.

If you notice anything missing from the list, <a href="mailto:khoekstra@ravensoft.com?subject=SoF2 Press">drop me a line</a> and
let me know.  I'll be sure to add it directly...


On a personal note...

I've started work on a screenplay for a horror movie.  My
research into the Hollywood scene has me laughing at the
<a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/getajob.htm">"How Do I Get A Job In The Games Industry?"</a> article I've been
maintaining for some time now.  I thought getting into this
biz was hard.  Getting a movie made appears to be impossible...

Fortunately, I'm not easily discouraged.  If any of you out
there have any tips, hints or suggestions about Hollywood,
screenwriting, finding an agent or any decent online resources,
<a href="mailto:khoekstra@ravensoft.com?subject=Screenwriting Schtuff">send me an e-mail</a> and fill me in.  I'd love to hear about it.

That's all for now.  Back to work on Soldier of Fortune II...

Friday, September 14th, 2001 - Gamers and Game Companies Unite!
<a href="http://www.gamerankings.com">GameRankings</a> is sponsoring a fundraiser to help the victims of
Tuesday's tragic events, whereby they are taking games and
related materials donated by game companies and auctioning them
off on Half.com and Ebay. All proceeds to go to the relief fund 
in the name of gamers everywhere.

Check out <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com">GameRankings.com</a> for details.  I hope everyone
can pitch in and try to offer some help in this time of
crisis and need...

*** UPDATE ***

File Mirrors now available at FilePlanet:

- <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?file=64076">Soldier of Fortune Platinum Map Pack</a> (3.5MB)
- <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?file=62316">Official Soldier of Fortune 1.07 Patch</a> (2MB)

*** UPDATE ***

*********************************************************

Tuesday, August 28th, 2001 - Soldier of Fortune Platinum
should be making its way to retail outlets today.  As with
Gold, we're releasing everything that's a part of Platinum
free to those who bought a previous version of Soldier of
Fortune.  The first part of that can be found here:

- <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/?file_id=151653">Soldier of Fortune Platinum Map Pack</a> (3.5MB)
- <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/?file_id=149506">Official Soldier of Fortune 1.07 Patch</a> (2MB)

The map pack contains five MP maps...four by Kevin Pochron,
now of Raven and one map that I did back when I was a designer
for Soldier.  Kevin touched it up for me and added all of the
startspots and weapons, etc.  So, for all intents and purposes,
you can heap your praise on Kevin for the new maps.  ;)  There
are instructions for installing the map pack in the readme.  

The 1.07 patch is essentially the same as Rick's 1.07f beta
patch, minus all documentation references to the word "beta."
If you have the beta patch, there's no need to update to 
this one as functionally they are identical.  If you have 1.06
or earlier, the upgrade is recommended.  As I noted in a prior
.plan udate, the 1.06 Gold Patch is needed before applying this
one.  Confusing, I know...

Feel free to download and mirror the patch and map pack
freely.  If you have the earlier 1.07 patch, which was
flawed or the 1.07f beta patch on your servers, please take
them down and replace them with this official version.

I'll keep you posted on the Soldier 2 trailer and the 
strategy guide and let you know when they will be available.

Totally off the subject, I have a question for you net-savvy
types out there:

I have a friend here in Madison who's a small business
owner.  He just registered a top-level domain name through
register.com and he wants to put up a website purely for 
informational purposes.  He doesn't need a lot of bandwidth
and doesn't plan to use the site for product ordering.  A
corporate e-mail address or two would be nice and simple
uploading and administration tools are essential.

That said, what hosting method or service do you recommend?
This site will be pretty small, so server space is not a
big deal.  What do you think is the best, most inexpensive
service out there?  I know register.com offers one for $15 a
month for example.  Anyone using that?

Send your recommendations to me at <a href="mailto:khoekstra@ravensoft.com?subject=Website Hosting">khoekstra@ravensoft.com</a>. 

Thanks in advance!

Thursday, August 16th, 2001 - Soldier of Fortune Platinum
Edition has Gone Gold!  Or...um...Platinum, as the case
may be.  Soldier of Fortune Platinum is:

- Soldier of Fortune Full Retail Game
- Gold Edition Maps/Mods/Enhancements
- 1.07f Patch Adding GameSpy Support To Multiplayer
- 5 New Multiplayer Maps
- Brady Games Strategy Guide (penned by me) In .pdf Format
- Preview Trailer of Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix

This edition of the game is meant for those who haven't
purchased Soldier of Fortune in any form to date.  As with
the Gold Edition, the Platinum Edition updates and features
will be freely available for download soon to those of you
who own Soldier of Fortune or Soldier of Fortune Gold.  

As soon as the Platinum Pack is available for download, 
I'll send out an announcement and make an update here.

If you want to order Soldier of Fortune Platinum, you can
do so through the <a href="http://store.activision.com/dr/v2/Ec_Main.entry24?SP=10023&PN=1&V1=332590&xid=9685&search_id=4769012&doc_id=3&DSP=&CUR=840&CACHE_ID=0">Activision Store here</a> for a mere $29.99.

*************************************************************

August 7th, 2001 - I’m off to QuakeCon. I’ll be showing SoF2
at the Activision booth all weekend with guest appearances by
Rick Johnson, Brian Raffel and Jim Hughes. Hopefully I’ll 
actually get to SEE some of the events going on. 

As it turns out, LucasArts and Activision will be showing 
the E3 demo of Jedi Knight 2 at QuakeCon. Check in at 
<a href="http://www.quakecon.org">Quakecon.org</a> for more information as it is available.

See you there...

**************************************************************

August 3rd, 2001 - Just wanted to send out thanks and congrats
to Crave Entertainment for the superb job they did making 
<a href=" http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=184388&mscssid=&ref=1&PromoCode=&site=&siteID=">Soldier of Fortune for the DreamCast</a>.  When they sent us an 
advanced copy of the game and we checked it out in our main 
conference room, some of us (myself included) nearly shed the
proverbial "single manly tear."  It's a fine translation of 
a PC game to a console format.  Great job, guys!

************************************************************

July 26th, 2001 - Almost a month since my last update...  Is
that some sort of record?  I think it just may be!  ;)

I've been working on finishing up the script for Soldier of
Fortune 2: Double Helix.  It's going well...  I just need to
add dialogue for the tutorial mission, add a few more generic
phrases and make up some guard conversations for the Hong Kong
and Kamchatka missions.  Should be ready to go soon, on track
for voice recording at the end of August.  Yay!  

We just finished up our builds of SoF2 and JK2 for upcoming
trade shows like Activate and QuakeCon.  I guess Raven won't
be at GenCon this year, though.  Bummer...  =(

I'm headed to QuakeCon this year, by the way...  It will be my 
first ever trip there.  Rick Johnson and I will be showing Soldier 
of Fortune 2, so stop by and say "hi" if you're in the 
neighborhood.  No word yet on whether or not JK2 will be making 
an appearance at QuakeCon, so don't ask.  LucasArts still hasn't 
made that call yet.  I'm sure they'll make an announcement if they
decide to attend...

Raven just ordered 21 new Dell PCs...P4 1.7GHZ with 512 MB RAM
and GeForce3 cards.  I'm setting them all up now.  I wish I 
could say it was fun, but I think there's a special ring of hell
reserved for people who set up PCs.  I'm there now...  ;)

More later...maybe next month.  If you're bored, I've also found
time to re-launch the <a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/users/khoekstra/">"Kenn's World"</a> website.  Just a skeleton
right now, but maybe someday it will be cool...

Rock and roll!

--Kenn

****************************************************************

July 6th, 2001 - The long-awaited 1.07 patch for Soldier of 
Fortune is here!  The patch removes WON support from the game 
and exchanges it for GameSpy browser support.  (CD Keys no 
longer required to play online)  There are also a number of other 
minor bug fixes included.

This patch requires that Soldier of Fortune be patched up to 1.06, 
first, which means if you have the Soldier of Fortune Gold Edition, 
this is the only patch you need.  If you have the standard Soldier 
of Fortune, you need the <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/?file_id=116666">1.06 Gold Patch</a> first and then this one.

- <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com">1.07 Patch Download (Approx: 2MB) at FilePlanet</a> (Free Registration Required)
- <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/?file_id=149506">1.07 Patch Download Mirror at 3DDownloads</a>

Enjoy!

**************************************************************

June 22nd, 2001 - All this talk of Quake's five-year anniversary
reminded me that this Sunday is Raven Software's eleven-year
anniversary!  In 1990, five men and one computer in a basement 
started Raven Software with a vision: to create an RPG for the
Amiga.  That game was Black Crypt.  Eleven years and fourteen 
titles later, Raven Software has expanded to more than 50 
employees and is working on not one, but three game titles.
Pretty cool stuff...

Congrats to Brian and Steve Raffel and all of the "old timers"
who've been here longer than I have.  I'm looking forward to 
the next eleven years. 

On a personal note, my ten-year high-school class reunion
is this weekend.  Big fun, big prizes, big danger...  =)

Wish me luck!  Have a great weekend, everyone.

********************************************************

May 10th, 2001 - The Elite Force Expansion Pack has been

Wednesday, May 26th, 1999 - A new day has dawned in Kenn's World...  Last night, I
asked Michele, the love of my life, to marry me.  And she said YES!  Thank you, Michele...
You've made me the happiest man in the world!  I look forward to spending the rest of
my life with you...  You are the most wonderful person I have ever known...

Thanks to Rob "Beroge" Gee for ring shopping with me and special thanks to 
Kim "Lee Majors" Lathrop for giving me the final "get in there, son...we need
a base runner" speech.  =)  Oh...and thanks to 94.1 WJJO for playing "Rainbow In The Dark"
during my drive to "the big moment."  I couldn't have done it without all of your help...

Hey Matt!  You're next, buddy...  In the immortal words of "Nature Boy" Ric Flair....WHOOOOOOOOO!

IN LOVING MEMORY - Kenneth Lee Hoekstra (August 26th, 1937 - April 23rd, 1998)

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
