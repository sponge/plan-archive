Tuesday, October 17th, 2000 - Well, all the "T's" have been
crossed and the "I's" have been dotted.  The Mac port of 
Elite Force is a done deal.  Check out <a href="http://www.westlakeinteractive.com/news0175.html">this press release</a>
from Westlake Interactive.  The Mac port is being developed
by <a href="http://www.aspyr.com">Aspyr Media</a> and they're in production now.  I don't know
when it will be ready to ship, but it is in the works.

It's nice to finally be able to "officially" announce 
something once legal does its thing.  =)

On another, completely unrelated note, I am convinced that
judgment day is upon us.  In the immoral words of Indiana
Jones: "Don't look, Marion.  Keep your eyes shut!"  Can
you believe a film studio <a href="http://ramhurl.film.com/smildemohurl.ram?file=filmcom/media/trailers/2000/rv8/vampi_newli_trail_176x132_vss100.rm">would do this to vampires</a>? 
(Note: RealPlayer required to view "the horror.")

I've lost all faith in the human condition...  =(

Wednesday, October 4th, 2000 - Tonight on UPN is the season
finale and season premiere of Star Trek: Voyager back to back.
If you're tuning in, watch out for the Elite Force commercials
that will be airing during both episodes!  There should be one
spot during the first episode, one during the end credits and
one about half-way through the second episode!  Set your VCRs!

Check out <a href="http://www.upn.com">http://www.upn.com</a> for local air times....

Tuesday, October 3rd, 2000 - I turned the big 2-7 on Sunday, 
October 1st, and my birthday weekend was a lot of fun.  Thanks
to everyone for the well-wishes.  I appreciate them!

Soldier of Fortune Gold is in the stores.  I just saw it at
Software Etc. in the mall over lunch...  The downloadable
version has been discussed in Rick Johnson's .plan recently,
so I won't go into that here.

There's an <a href="http://www.digitalgamedeveloper.com/Htm/Stories/eliteforce/eliteforce.htm">Elite Force Interview</a> with Raven's Brian Pelletier
and Michael Gummelt over at DigitalGameDeveloper.com.  There's
also a <a href="http://machinima.com/articles/atf_elite_force/">postmortem on the in-game cinematics</a> over at Machinima.com.

GameSpy has thrown down the gauntlet with Raven.  We'll be having
a GameSpy Arcade chat on Thursday at 4pm, followed by a little
Team DM'ing and CTF play.  They've been talking a little smack,
so it will be interesting to see how it all shakes out.

Thursday, September 28th, 2000 - I haven't used my .plan file
as a soapbox or a political tool for about two years now, so 
it's time to buck the trend. (The following are my opinions
and mine alone...not those of Raven, Activision or Jake Simpson)

I have been staying away from the whole .mp3 controversy over
the past several months because .mp3s haven't really interested
me at all.  I prefer having the music on CD because of the
artwork, liner notes and just plain familiarity with the use
and the format.  As such, I shed no tears when the music
industry started going after Napster and MP3.com for piracy.

Today, however, I've found a new wrinkle in the argument.  I
heard a song by an artist called Edwin McCain called "I'll be"
in the trailer for Bounce last night when I went to see The
Matrix at our local theatre.  (Yes, the Matrix was here before.
This was a special showing on the ultra-screen as a re-release.)
I thought to myself: This song could be the song I've been
looking for to use for the Bride and Groom dance at my upcoming
wedding this Halloween.  The problem?  I'm not all that 
familiar with the song and I wanted to make sure it wasn't
about killing your relatives or breaking up with your girlfriend
or cheating on your wife or any such nonsense...

Enter: The Problem -- I'm digging around on the net to find
an .mp3 file of the damned song so I can listen to it a few
times and get a feel for it.  What do I find?  Jack squat!
I find fifty links to the song and all of them are busted
because of this legal nonsense.  Oh, and I found a twenty 
second sample on CDNow.com that's not even as complete as the
blurb I heard during the trailer.  

Does anyone at Raven own the album?  *laughs*  What do you think?  
Let's see...Megadeth, Metallica, Metal Church...nope.  No McCain.  
Ugh...  Just shoot me...

So now, instead of being able to SAMPLE the song so I can go
out and buy the album if I like it, I have to huddle around
the radio for hours without running to the bathroom or call 
the local Muzak station and ask them to play the freakin' thing 
so I don't have to go over to Best Buy and drop $14 on a CD that 
I'll never listen to again if I decide I don't like it.  Doesn't 
sound like much fun to me in any case...

I think music companies and .mp3 sites need to find a compromise
soon that makes everyone happy.  I'm not a l33t h4x0r and I
don't have the time or inclination to try to break the law
to hear a song.  I've never endorsed piracy and I won't start
now.  As long as the law says "Napster Bad," I'll abide by that.

Hurry up and come to some sort of agreement that works.  In the 
meantime, I'll be on hold with the local muzak station...  *sigh*

Wednesday, May 26th, 1999 - A new day has dawned in Kenn's World...  Last night, I
asked Michele, the love of my life, to marry me.  And she said YES!  Thank you, Michele...
You've made me the happiest man in the world!  I look forward to spending the rest of
my life with you...  You are the most wonderful person I have ever known...

Thanks to Rob "Beroge" Gee for ring shopping with me and special thanks to 
Kim "Lee Majors" Lathrop for giving me the final "get in there, son...we need
a base runner" speech.  =)  Oh...and thanks to 94.1 WJJO for playing "Rainbow In The Dark"

Hey Matt!  You're next, buddy...  In the immortal words of "Nature Boy" Ric Flair....WHOOOOOOOOO!

IN LOVING MEMORY - Kenneth Lee Hoekstra (August 26th, 1937 - April 23rd, 1998)

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
