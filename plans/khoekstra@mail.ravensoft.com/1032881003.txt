Enjoy!  

On a personal note, I'm heading back to school for the first time
in almost 8 years.  I've decided to get my MSM (Master of Science
in Management) from Cardinal Stritch University.  I'll be going to
class every Tuesday night from 6 - 10pm and I'll finish the program
in about 16 months.  I've been wanting to go back to school for 
some time now.  I'm glad I finally found the courage (and the time)
to do it.  Should be fun...

Take care, all!


************************************************************

September 12th, 2002 - Rumors of my death have been greatly
exaggerated...  I'm still alive and well.

I'm excited to see that <a href="http://www.macplay.com">MacPlay</a> has brought over <a href="http://www.macplay.com/games/hexen2.shtml">Hexen II</a>
and <a href="http://www.macplay.com/games/heretic2.shtml">Heretic II</a> to the MacOS.  Best of all, they're selling
at the very palatable price of just $19.99 each!  Thought
I'd pass that along...

Oh, and did I neglect to mention that MacPlay also
has <a href="http://www.macplay.com/games/sof2.shtml">Soldier of Fortune II</a> available?  

Let's see...  What else has been going on?  Raven 
continues to grow.  We're up to 65 people now with 8
more on the way.  I think we're going to start having
the new guys wear nametags or something.  

I finished the screenplay I was working on and I've 
started another.  If all goes well, my friends and I will
start shooting it in the next few weeks.  That should be
an interesting learning experience.

That's about it...  Have a great weekend everybody!

Wednesday, July 17th, 2002 - A few issues for today...

Jedi Outcast 1.04 Dedicated Server Issues:

A number of people have reported issues with the new 1.04 
dedicated servers for Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast showing 
up as 1.03 in the server browsers after successful patching 
and updating.  The reason for this is  likely that server admins 
are shutting down their servers, patching them to 1.04 and 
re-launching them before the server times out with the master 
server.  When the server starts up again, the master server 
sends its heartbeat to the game server, thinks it’s still 
up from before and keeps it running as 1.03.  

The best solution to this problem is to take down your server 
and leave it down for 10 minutes (5 is the timeout) after you 
patch it before launching it again.  This allows the master 
server to clear the old server info from its cache, send a 
new heartbeat to the game server and re-list it as 1.04.

The other common issues that people are reporting relate to 
people not having the assets5.pk3 in their base directories 
and replacing their old executables with the new ones.  You
MUST install the 1.04 client patch BEFORE you install the
dedicated server updates.  

Those two fixes should solve most of the pending issues with 
1.04 dedicated server utils for Jedi Outcast.


Raven Is Hiring:

On a separate note, Raven is about to embark on a pretty 
large hiring spree.  We’ve expanded into adjacent office space 
and are expanding our development staff from 60 people up to 
73…three full teams.

As such, we’re in need of a couple of Game Programmers (one for
PC Stuff and one for Console Stuff) and a gaggle of Level Designers
(with Quake III experience and other 3D Package Experience).  

For art, modeling and animation we’re pretty well covered, but 
it couldn’t hurt to send in your stuff.  We still have some 
“to be hireds” in the art department as well.

For information on our company, what we want to see and where 
to send your stuff, visit <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/jobs.html">http://www.ravensoft.com/jobs.html</a> 
(Ignore the “We are not currently looking to fill any specific 
positions” parts…I haven’t had time to update everything yet. Heh…)


SOF2 Chat Today:

GameSpy is hosting a SOF2 chat today to talk about the new
1.01 update, new gametype and weapon, future plans for the
game and anything else people want to ask (within reason).

Be there at 3pm Central time...details <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/news/fullstory.asp?id=3663">here</a>.

That is all...

*************************************************************


Wednesday, July 10th, 2002 -  Important Jedi Outcast Info:

LucasArts will be releasing the 1.04 update for Jedi Knight II: 
Jedi Outcast tomorrow (Thursday) evening on their website at 
<a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/outcast/html/default.htm">http://www.lucasarts.com/products/outcast/html/default.htm</a>.  
Feel free to download and mirror it once it is available.

The update includes all of the fixes from 1.03, so if you don’t 
have that update yet, this is the only one you’ll need.  A list 
of the changes in 1.03 can be found here: 
<a href="http://support.lucasarts.com/patches/jedioutcast.htm">http://support.lucasarts.com/patches/jedioutcast.htm</a>

The primary focus of 1.04 is multiplayer balance.  

Some of the features/fixes include:

Multiplayer
-----------
  * Corrected issue which caused servers to crash in rare
    instances.
  * Corrected issue causing damage not to ramp up and down
    properly when using the backstab move in light saber stance.
  * Corrected bug allowing players to pivot while executing 
    backstab moves in all stances.  Players may no longer pivot
    when executing these moves.
  * Fixed bug causing force pull to be unblockable by people
    with equal or greater pull rank.
  * Adjusted ammo usage of the Imperial repeater alt-fire.
  * Fixed bug allowing inventory items to be used in FFA saber
    challenges.
  * Corrected an exploit which allowed players to fall from
    large heights at a slow rate.
  * Corrected issue which caused pain sounds not to play
    properly when hit by opponents. Pain sounds should now be
    relative to the amount of damage taken.

New dedicated servers will also be released tomorrow.  We'll send 
those out to all of the gaming file sites so you’ll be able to get 
new servers set up immediately.

A few other notes on 1.04:

-  Saved games are unaffected from 1.03
-  Demos recorded using 1.03 are not compatible with 1.04
-  Mod makers will have to update their mods to reflect new the 
   IP protocol introduced in 1.04.  This will be a minor adjustment 
   to your existing mod stuffs.
-  Once you upgrade to 1.04, only servers running version 1.04 
   will be visible in your in game browser.  There may be a short 
   period of time where there are few 1.04 servers to play on as 
   server admins update to the new version.

Thanks!  We appreciate your continued support of Jedi Outcast in 
the online community.

******************************************


Saturday, May 25th, 2002 - Where to begin?

The Soldier of Fortune II single player demo
is out there to download an enjoy.  You can
grab it from <a href="http://www.3dgamers.com/games/soldierfortune2/">3D Gamers Here</a>.

The most common concern seems to be "Why is
there no blood in the demo?"  The simple 
answer is, it's off by default.  When you
launch the game you can go into the Violence
Lock menu (fourth option down - the Padlock)
and hit ENTER at the password prompt.  You
can adjust the settings to your liking and
create your own password, if you want.  Make
sure to write it down and don't lose it.

The tools and SDK are also available for SOF2
at <a href="http://www.3dgamers.com/games/soldierfortune2/">3D Gamers Here</a>.

Support for the full version of Soldier of
Fortune II is being handled by Activision.
You can visit their <a href="https://activision.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/activision.cfg/php/enduser/home.php">support page here</a>.

To help out, we've put up a resource page
at <a href="http://sof2.ravensoft.com">http://sof2.ravensoft.com</a> that includes
<a href="http://204.97.248.99/ib/ikonboard.pl">brand new forums</a> and a <a href="http://sof2.ravensoft.com/faq.htm">Top Solutions FAQ</a>.

I've been trying to answer as many questions
as possible on the boards and in the FAQ, so
that's a good place to start if you're having
issues with the full version of SOF2.

Of particular interest in the FAQ is probably
the single player performance guide I put
together which you can <a href="http://sof2.ravensoft.com/faq.htm#slow">find here</a>.

Keep in mind, too, that CD Keys for SoF2 are
located INSIDE the CD jewel case and are on
a sticker pasted on the inside of the back
cover with the Wolfenstein ad on it.  It's in
bright red letters.  You can't miss it.  Don't
throw your CD key or jewel case away.  Keys
can't be replaced so don't lose them. 

Be sure to check your CDs before you install
to see that they are clean.  We found a CD
with goop on it from the factory press and it
wouldn't install properly.  Check 'em out 
before you pop 'em in.

All of this info is in the FAQ.

That's all for now...  Thanks for listening!
Enjoy the game.

*************************************************

Friday, May 17th, 2002 - A few things for
the weekend:

1. Our master servers for Elite Force and
Jedi Outcast will be out tomorrow (Saturday)
morning from 9am CST to approximately 1pm,
depending on how our network maintenance
goes.  Just so you know.  Originally it was
slated for last week Saturday, but had to
be delayed.

2. For those of you unhappy with the increased
saber blocking in CTF and FFA modes in the 1.03 
patch for Jedi Outcast, you can turn off the 
changes by setting the CVAR g_saberTraceSaberFirst 
to "0" in your server configs.  Setting this
to "1" = More Blocking, "0" = Less Blocking. It
defaults to "1" in 1.03.

Have a great weekend, everyone!

********************************************

Tuesday, May 7th, 2002 - The 1.03 patch for
Jedi Outcast has been posted over at 
LucasArts' website.  You can grab the 
patch here:

- <a href="http://support.lucasarts.com/patches/jedioutcast.htm">Jedi Outcast 1.03 Patch</a>

If you're having problems installing the
patch and you get the error "Directory is
Invalid! Target files could not be created"

I have a few suggestions for you:

1. If you're using a pirated copy of the game,
don't.  :)  That's one cause of the error.

2. IF any of the patched files are marked READ ONLY 
this message will appear.  Since some people have 
uninstalled, my guess would be that people have their 
own assets2.pk3 that doesn’t get uninstalled and it 
is marked READ ONLY.

3. IF the launcher or JK2 is running, then this will 
happen.  Re-booting may help

If all else fails, you can uninstall the game,
re-install it to a custom directory like
c:jk2 and it will re-write the registry
entries and the patch will install fine.

Updated Linux and Win32 Dedicated servers
are also available.  You can get them (or
will be able to, soon) at:

- <a href="http://www.3dgamers.com/games/jedioutcast/">3D Gamers</a>
- <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/?directory=/ravensoft/JediOutcast/">3DDownloads</a>

- <a href="http://www.jedi-outcast.com">Jedi-Outcast.com</a>

A list of what's fixed in the 1.03 patch
can be <a href="http://support.lucasarts.com/patches/jedioutcast.htm">found here</a>.  

The <a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/jedioutcast/">Jedi Outcast Resource Page</a> will be
updated soon with new links, awards and new 
FAQ entries.

*******************************************************

Monday, April 22nd, 2002 - The tools and level editor
for Jedi Outcast have been released to the public.  The
4MB download includes:

JK2Radiant - The map editor.
MD3View - Model viewer for .md3 format models
ModView - Model viewer for .glm (Ghoul2) format model
ShaderEd2 - The shader editor/viewer
sof2map - The map compiler, you will not be using this directly, JK2Radiant uses this.

You can download it from:

- <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?file=87277">FilePlanet</a>
- <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/files/fileshack2.x?JK2EditingTools.zip">ShackNews</a>
- <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/?file_id=159544">3DDownloads</a>
- <a href="http://www.jediknightii.net">JediKnightii.net</a>

I expect mirrors will appear shortly at:

- <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com">Blue's News</a>
- <a href="http://www.jk2files.com">JK2Files.com</a>
- <a href="http://www.massassi.net">The Massassi Temple</a>
- <a href="http://www.jedicenter.com">Jedi Center</a>
- <a href="http://www.jedi-outcast.com">Jedi-Outcast.com</a>

Feel free to download and mirror these files as you see
fit.  Remember of course that these are released "as is"
and are unsupported by Raven/Activision/LucasArts.

Another Jedi Outcast fix for you:

If you're getting the CL_ParsePacketEntities error in JK2
multiplayer, it's likely because you are using the cracked
executable.  That's the only instance we've seen the error.
Shame on you.  ;)


******************************************************

Friday, April 19th, 2002 - The Soldier of Fortune II 
multiplayer test is out there!  You can grab it from
the list of mirrors at:

So far it looks like the response is overwhelmingly positive!
I'm glad everyone is enjoying it.  Our GameSpy chat yesterday
drew a record number of chatters...more than doubling the
previous record!  Thanks, all for showing up to rap with us!
You can find a <a href="http://www.planetsoldier.com/features/interviews/ravenchatapril2002.shtml">transcript of the chat here</a>.  You can also 
find an <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/news/fullstory.asp?id=3298">interview</a> that Rick and I did for GameSpy Daily and 
read the 3DActionPlanet <a href="http://www.3dactionplanet.com/features/firstlooks/sof2mptest/">MP impressions here</a>.

A few notes:

1. For those who think the speed of the game is slower than
the original SOF, you can change the speed of the players on
the server using the g_speed console command.  You can change
it to whatever you like (for all you speed freaks out there).

2. Those wondering about the gore, keep in mind that there is
less gore in the MP version of the game because of networking
concerns.  SOF2 multiplayer will support 64 players.

3. If you're getting an "invalid game version" error message
when attempting to connect to servers, it's because you're
using the leaked version.  Shame on you.  ;)  Get the new one!

4. For dedicated servers, +set dedicated 1 is a dedicated LAN.
+set dedicated 2 is a dedicated internet public server.

Happy fragging!

Sunday, February 3rd, 2002 - Today is my Five Year Anniversary
with Raven Software.  Five years ago today I started work with
a PPRO 200 with 128 MB of RAM and a 2GB hard drive with a copy
of Windows 95 and 3D Studio Max 1.2.  I'd never seen the real
Internet before, only muds and a vax at UW-Whitewater. 

A month or so after I started, Jon Zuk and I got Monster 3D 
Voodoo1 cards from Best Buy and proceeded to put colored lighting 
into a Raven title for the first time.  God, has it been that 
long?  I can hardly believe it...

At that time, we were working on Take No Prisoners, MageSlayer
and Hexen II for Red Orb, GT Interactive and Activision.  Raven 
consisted of about 25 people, all of which actually fit around 
the table and in the chairs of our main conference room.

In the five years since I started, I've watched the building
expand twice and the team expand to 60 people.  We released
those three games we were working on, were bought by Activision
and we went on to produce Portal of Praevus, Heretic II, Soldier 
of Fortune (+Gold and Platinum), Elite Force, Elite Force Expansion 
Pack and we're closing in on the completion of Jedi Outcast and 
Soldier 2 with two more titles waiting in the wings.  

My machine today has upgraded by 10 times the MHZ, 3 processors, 4 
times the RAM, 40 times the hard drive space, 16 times the video 
memory, four versions of MAX and five or six OS's.

I had just watched the Packers beat the Patriots in Superbowl XXXI
and now, five years later, I'm about to go home and watch another
Superbowl (featuring the Patriots, no less).

It's been a good five years.  Here's looking at five more...

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
