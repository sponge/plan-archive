April 16th, 2001 - Just a quick note to let everyone
know that I'm alive and well and back to work following
my vacation to Texas.  Thanks for all the well-wishes...

First order of business:

We've taken down our WWW2 server for maintenance and
upgrade.  As a result, our on-site tech support web pages, 
our employee home pages and our message boards  are down.  
With any luck, they'll be back up in running in the next 
day or so.  I apologize for the inconvenience.

I'd say "it's great to be back," but judging by the pile
on my desk, that wouldn't be entirely true.  =)  

Take care, all...

*******************************************************

April 5th, 2001 - Well, I'm off on vacation to the Lone
Star State from now until Easter Sunday.  It's about time
I got some R&R, methinks.  I won't have access to my
e-mail while I'm away, but I will be answering it all
when I return.

Take care, everyone!  See you when I get back.

--Kenn

March 27th, 2001 - Nothing work related, I'm afraid...  I
just want someone to explain to me how the people at the
<a href="http://www.rockhall.com">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> can induct Aerosmith, Queen and
Bonnie Raitt before giving the nod to truly influential rock
bands like Black Sabbath, KISS and Judas Priest?

Now I realize that there are only a limited number of spaces
that can be filled each year.  So explain to me how it is that
John Lennon and Paul McCartney can be inducted as solo artists
after being inducted as Beatles and Eric Clapton can be part
of the hall of fame as a member of two groups AND as a solo
artist before they induct Black Sabbath, KISS and Judas Priest?
Am I expected to believe that John Lennon and/or Paul McCartney's
solo careers were more critical to rock history than any of
these bands?  The Beatles' influence is undeniable, but as
solo acts?  I don't think so...

Without Black Sabbath, there would be no hard rock or metal.
Judas Priest pioneered the dual-guitar attack that prevaded
throughout the 70's and 80's and still persists in many ways
to this day.  Only the Beatles and Rolling Stones have more
Gold and Platinum albums than KISS.  But I guess a string of
27 Gold and Platinum albums, 90 million plus record sales, ten
Platinum singles, 6 Platinum home videos and a spot on the
top ten list of largest concert draws in history isn't enough 
to induct KISS before Aerosmith?  Puhleez...

Someone tell me this is a dream... Next thing you know, they'll 
be inducting AC/DC in favor of the big three.  Who knows?  Maybe 
next year they'll wake up.  But I doubt it...  

End Rant (With sincere apologies to anyone who wasted their time
reading this little tirade)

March 2nd, 2001 - Wow!  A whole month since my last .plan update!
What happened to the Kenn Hoekstra of yesteryear?  I guess he's
been busy...  Does it bother you when people talk about themselves
in the third person?  =)

I saw one hell of a deal today when I was browsing GameStop.com.
They're offering Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force, Star Trek:
Armada and Star Trek: Klingon Academy as a bundle for $49.98!
Not a bad deal, if you ask me.  But then again, maybe I'm a
little biased?  =)  If you're interested, check out <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product-detail.jsp?origin=sear&sku=B642322">this link</a>.

In other news, it looks as though Raven will be hiring a character
animator soon.  For details, check out <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/frameset.html">www.ravensoft.com</a> and click

Friday, February 2nd, 2001 - Thanks to everyone for sending me
your PhotoShop 6.0 solutions for that PNG problem.  We've found
some other issues with the program as well, so I think we're
going to stick with 5 or 5.5 for a while longer.  Cheers to the
guys at 3-D Realms, Gearbox and other developers who chimed in
with help.  I appreciate it...

Happy 10 Year Anniversary to Id Software and Blizzard Software!
Tomorrow is my 4 Year Anniversary with Raven...a modest feat in 
its own right, though not nearly as impressive as the 
aforementioned milestones.  Congrats, all!  Here's to ten more...

Have you seen that <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/january01/quakeu/">article on GameSpy</a> about Universities 
offering degrees in game development?  I'd be interested to learn
more about that.  Quite honestly, I don't really see how that can
be done.  Maybe I'm wrong, but...

What about the blistering pace of technology?  Think of how much 
games and game development change over a period of four years
(Or two years for that matter).  Is there any way to set up any
kind of curriculum for a degree program without perpetually 
changing it?  You could learn something one semester and it could
be outdated by the next semester.

I also have to wonder what the Universities' definition of "Game
Design" is.  Are they talking about Project Leads?  Training
students to be the one person who heads up a game's development
and oversees every aspect of it?  If that's the case, I don't see
how that would work...  Not unless the student can get a job at
a production level first and serve in that capacity for several
years.

I look at it this way...  I have a Bachelor's Degree in English 
Writing.  When I got out of school, I applied for 20 jobs at
companies and newspapers looking for writers and/or editors.  
Despite my 4.0 GPA, I got the same response repeatedly: "Sucks 
to be you...you have no experience."  It was my wake-up call
about how the job market really works: you can't get a job in
your field without experience and you can't get experience without
finding a job in your field.  

If you correlate this experience to a degree in game design,
who's going to hire someone with a degree in that field if they
can't work as a level designer, artist, programmer or sound guy?
No one is going to hand over the reigns of a multi-million dollar
project to someone with a framed piece of paper if they don't have
experience.  Do you see the double-edged sword here?  

I'm going to be keeping my eye on this to see how it all shakes
out, but my first impression is not a good one.  Maybe what
Universities should do is offer game development as a minor or
as an emphasis.  I could see a four year degree in programming,
art, or sound with an emphasis/minor in game development, but I
can't see training someone to be a "think tank."  Unless you front
the money for a company and you're taking all the risk, both
personally and financially, there is no such position...  If
there is, I've never seen it.

What does everyone else think about this?  <a href="mailto:khoekstra@ravensoft.com?subject=Degrees In Game Development">Let Me Know</a>...

Have a great weekend!

Friday, January 19th, 2001 - Good Lord...  Nineteen days into
2001 and this is my first update.  What happened to the old me?
Heh...

Question for you artist types out there :

Our artists are having a problem with Photoshop 6.0 and the PNG 
file format. The PNG file format is discarding the alpha channel 
when attempting to save. This seems to be an inconsistent error.  
Opening the same PNG file will result in different results. 
Photoshop 6.0 has two PNG file formats listed in saving PNG8 
and PNG24, but they are not marked so you can tell which is which.  
It really comes down to a crapshoot on if it will work or not. Any advice 
or solutions to this headache are greatly appreciated.

Thoughts?  <a href="mailto:khoekstra@ravensoft.com?subject=Photoshop 6.0 Solution">Drop me a line</a>. 

Thanks in advance!  

I've finished the revamp of Ravensoft.com and added a page for
each of our classic games from Black Crypt through the present.
If you are interested in a Raven Software history lesson, visit
<a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/frameset.html">http://www.ravensoft.com</a> (Flash Required) and click on the
Raven Games tab in the left column.  Each game description has
a link in it to the individual game pages.  Nif-tay...

Have a great weekend!  All the best...

Friday, December 22nd, 2000 - I posted an article that I

How cool is that?

***********************************************************

Thursday, December 14th, 2000 - Did you hear about the
snowstorm that rocked the midwest recently?  How bad
was it, you ask?  Well <a href="http://www.writersofthelostark.com/ravenhoth1.jpg">check THIS out</a>...

We're having some trouble adapting the speeders to the cold... =)

Have a great weekend!


**********************************************************

Wednesday, November 22nd, 2000 - Raven and Activision are
off Thursday through Monday, so have a safe and happy
Thanksgiving weekend, everyone!  Be careful out there if
you're traveling...

Talk to you all soon...

********************************************************

Friday, November 10th, 2000 - Well, I'm back for good and
the wedding was a blast!  The biggest adjustment?  Typing
with a ring on my left ring finger...  *laughs*  Other than
that, things are peachy and married life is grand.  =) I'm
all caught up on the unbelievable amount of e-mails I 
received, too.  Sorry if anyone had to wait too long for a
response.  Thanks for your patience...  I hope to post some
wedding pictures soon!  Stay tuned...

As you probably read, we just released the Hexen II Source
Code!  You can read the <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/announcements.shtml">announcement here</a> and grab the
<a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/showfile.php3?file_id=107009">source code here</a>.

As far as the Presidential election goes, how's this for
<a href="http://evilavatar.com/EA/News/M15830/pictures.htm?imgID=2300">funny</a>?  <a href="http://evilavatar.com/EA/News/M15830/pictures.htm?imgID=2301">Or this?</a>? =)  Now that it's over, I can tell 
you that I voted for George W. Bush.  At this point, though, 
I don't care who wins.  I just hope one of them is man enough 
to step down and let the country (and the stock market) move 
on...  Nixon did it...Al or G.W. should, too.

My two (or three) cents...

*********************************************************

Monday, November 6th, 2000 - Though I'm not due back to
work until Wednesday, I felt it was important to come in
and make this update:

Tomorrow is election day.  George W. Bush and Al Gore 
are running for President of the United States and it's 
time to get out and vote.  There are also numerous other 
state and federal offices up for grabs and your vote DOES 
make a difference.  The Presidential race is especially 
important because the winning candidate will likely shape 
the face of the law for the next forty years with his 
selection of several Supreme Court Justices.  The latest
polls show a dead heat this election, so now more than
ever your vote can make a big difference.

Many men and women have fought and died over the years for 
your right to vote and you should honor them by exercising 
that right.  It's a simple thing that takes very little
time.  Just do it...

I'd love to use this forum as an opportunity to endorse a
candidate, but I won't.  I'd rather point you to some
resources to read more about each candidate so you can 
make an informed decision.  Here are the most useful
sites on the 'net that I've seen so far:

* <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com">GeorgeWBush.com</a>
* <a href="http://www.algore.com">AlGore.com</a>
* <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/resources/where.they.stand/">Where The Candidates Stand On The Issues</a>
* <a href="http://www.mtv.com/nav/intro_chooseorlose.html">Choose Or Lose</a>
* <a href="http://www.rockthevote.com">RockTheVote.com</a>

Thanks for listening...  Get out there and VOTE!!!!

Friday, October 27th, 2000 - This is my last .plan update
as a "free man."  I'll be off next week to get married on
a cruise down in the Virgin Islands.  Michele and I are
tying the knot on Halloween in St. Thomas.  As a result,
I will not be back at Raven until November 7th.  

Take care, everyone.  I'll talk to you all when I get back...
All the best,

Tuesday, October 24th, 2000 - As you may have noted in
James Monroe's .plan file, the Elite Force Dedicated
Linux Server is <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/showfile.php3?file_id=103589">available for download over at 3DDownloads</a>.

RE: Joystick Code in Elite Force

Many joystick users complained about the joystick code in the 
Elite Force demo, so we changed it for the full version.
Now the joystick users who weren't complaining are complaining 
about the new joystick code and configuration options.  The 
solution?  The upcoming patch for Elite Force will allow users 
to choose between the demo setup and the original full version 
setup.  This should solve a lot of the problems that you've
been having.  We sent the patch to Activision for QA testing,
but I have no idea when we're going to release it.  Thank you
for not asking...  Maybe now both sides can be happy?  =)

I noticed in this week's Best Buy circular that they're having
a huge sale on KISS - Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child!  You
can get the full version for $9.99 and the Collector's Edition
(which I highly recommend) for a mere $17.99.  This is a solid
first-person shooter and I recommend grabbing it if you don't
own it already.  I'll be grabbing another CE tonight...

Only 7 more days until my wedding.  And they say the only 
thing we have to fear is fear itself...  *laughs*

***************************************************************

Tuesday, October 17th, 2000 - Well, all the "T's" have been
crossed and the "I's" have been dotted.  The Mac port of 
Elite Force is a done deal.  Check out <a href="http://www.westlakeinteractive.com/news0175.html">this press release</a>
from Westlake Interactive.  The Mac port is being developed
by <a href="http://www.aspyr.com">Aspyr Media</a> and they're in production now.  I don't know
when it will be ready to ship, but it is in the works.

It's nice to finally be able to "officially" announce 
something once legal does its thing.  =)

On another, completely unrelated note, I am convinced that
judgment day is upon us.  In the immortal words of Indiana
Jones: "Don't look, Marion.  Keep your eyes shut!"  Can
you believe a film studio <a href="http://ramhurl.film.com/smildemohurl.ram?file=filmcom/media/trailers/2000/rv8/vampi_newli_trail_176x132_vss100.rm">would do this to vampires</a>? 
(Note: RealPlayer required to view "the horror.")

I've lost all faith in the human condition...  =(

Wednesday, May 26th, 1999 - A new day has dawned in Kenn's World...  Last night, I
asked Michele, the love of my life, to marry me.  And she said YES!  Thank you, Michele...
You've made me the happiest man in the world!  I look forward to spending the rest of
my life with you...  You are the most wonderful person I have ever known...

Thanks to Rob "Beroge" Gee for ring shopping with me and special thanks to

IN LOVING MEMORY - Kenneth Lee Hoekstra (August 26th, 1937 - April 23rd, 1998)

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
