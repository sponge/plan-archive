**********************************************************

November 15th, 2002 - Thanks to everyone for their 
assistance in my recent Heretic II quest.  I appreciate
all of the help.

Your reading assignment for the weekend...  Go to Kevin
Spacey's film project website at <a href="http://www.triggerstreet.com">http://www.triggerstreet.com</a>,
register, and read my first screenplay, entitled "Cold Front."
You'll find it in the Horror section, or by searching the
screenplay section of the site for...Cold Front.  ;-)

I hope you enjoy it...  Comments?  Feedback?  <a href="mailto:khoekstra@ravensoft.com?subject=Cold Front Comments">Send it</a>.

Have a great weekend!


*******************************************************

October 29th, 2002 - An unusual request here, but does 
anyone out there by some act of God have the .zip file of
Heretic II screenshots I released on or about January of
1999?

Yeah, yeah, yeah...crazy, right?  As I recall, I put out a
bunch of shots right around the time the EP released and
called Heretic II the "bloodiest game ever."  Those five
or six shots illustrated my point, if you know what I
mean?  ;-)

Well, if anyone out there happens to have those or know
where I can find them, let me know.  Thanks!

**********************************************************

October 23rd, 2002 - If you're wondering why Ravensoft.com
is down, it's because of another DNS change that is in the
process of propogating.  Once everything's back in place,
there shouldn't be any more surprises for quite a while.

I'd guess it should be widely available again by this
weekend sometime.

Thanks for your patience...

*********************************************************

October 18th, 2002 - Just a heads up to all of the Elite
Force players out there.  We're migrating the Elite Force
Master Server to Activision and we'll be submitting the
DNS changes on Monday.  Over the course of the next week,
we'll be running the two master servers concurrently and
if everything propogates correctly, we'll shut down the
existing server and leave the new one up permanently.

If you experience any troubles playing Elite Force over
the next week (starting Monday), please e-mail us at
<a href="mailto:trekdns@ravensoft.com?subject=Elite Force DNS Problems">TrekDNS@ravensoft.com</a> and report the error.  Thanks in
advance for your patience and assistance.

Speaking of Elite Force, Activision recently announced
the Star Trek Action Pack, which includes Elite Force, the
Expansion Pack and Star Trek Armada I and II for the very
reasonable price of $29.99.  'Twould make a great holiday
gift, methinks.  You can grab it <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=229099">here</a>.

Oh yeah...and thanks for all the help with finding that
Simpsons .wav file.  The search is over.  Have a great
weekend!

***********************************************************

October 9th, 2002 - Totally non-work related...  

Does anyone out there have a .wav file of Homer Simpson 
saying "Urge to kill...rising" from the Treehouse of Horror V 
episode from Season Six?  The line is from the skit that was a 
takeoff of the Shining...

I've been looking for it for some time now with no success.  I 
found one from later in the episode, "Urge to kill fading...
fading...RISING...fading...gone" but not the original one.

Any help would be appreciated.  E-mail me at: <a href="mailto:khoekstra@ravensoft.com?subject=Urge To Kill...Rising">khoekstra@ravensoft.com</a> 

Thanks!  Carry on...

Enjoy!  

On a personal note, I'm heading back to school for the first time
in almost 8 years.  I've decided to get my MSM (Master of Science
in Management) from Cardinal Stritch University.  I'll be going to
class every Tuesday night from 6 - 10pm and I'll finish the program
in about 16 months.  I've been wanting to go back to school for 
some time now.  I'm glad I finally found the courage (and the time)
to do it.  Should be fun...

Take care, all!


************************************************************

September 12th, 2002 - Rumors of my death have been greatly
exaggerated...  I'm still alive and well.

I'm excited to see that <a href="http://www.macplay.com">MacPlay</a> has brought over <a href="http://www.macplay.com/games/hexen2.shtml">Hexen II</a>
and <a href="http://www.macplay.com/games/heretic2.shtml">Heretic II</a> to the MacOS.  Best of all, they're selling
at the very palatable price of just $19.99 each!  Thought
I'd pass that along...

Oh, and did I neglect to mention that MacPlay also
has <a href="http://www.macplay.com/games/sof2.shtml">Soldier of Fortune II</a> available?  

Let's see...  What else has been going on?  Raven 
continues to grow.  We're up to 65 people now with 8
more on the way.  I think we're going to start having
the new guys wear nametags or something.  

I finished the screenplay I was working on and I've 
started another.  If all goes well, my friends and I will
start shooting it in the next few weeks.  That should be
an interesting learning experience.

That's about it...  Have a great weekend everybody!

Fortune II is being handled by Activision.

********************************************

Tuesday, May 7th, 2002 - The 1.03 patch for
Jedi Outcast has been posted over at 
LucasArts' website.  You can grab the 
patch here:

- <a href="http://support.lucasarts.com/patches/jedioutcast.htm">Jedi Outcast 1.03 Patch</a>

If you're having problems installing the
patch and you get the error "Directory is
Invalid! Target files could not be created"

I have a few suggestions for you:

1. If you're using a pirated copy of the game,
don't.  :)  That's one cause of the error.

2. IF any of the patched files are marked READ ONLY 
this message will appear.  Since some people have 
uninstalled, my guess would be that people have their 
own assets2.pk3 that doesn’t get uninstalled and it 
is marked READ ONLY.

3. IF the launcher or JK2 is running, then this will 
happen.  Re-booting may help

If all else fails, you can uninstall the game,
re-install it to a custom directory like
c:jk2 and it will re-write the registry
entries and the patch will install fine.

Updated Linux and Win32 Dedicated servers
are also available.  You can get them (or
will be able to, soon) at:

- <a href="http://www.3dgamers.com/games/jedioutcast/">3D Gamers</a>
- <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/?directory=/ravensoft/JediOutcast/">3DDownloads</a>

- <a href="http://www.jedi-outcast.com">Jedi-Outcast.com</a>

A list of what's fixed in the 1.03 patch
can be <a href="http://support.lucasarts.com/patches/jedioutcast.htm">found here</a>.  

The <a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/jedioutcast/">Jedi Outcast Resource Page</a> will be
updated soon with new links, awards and new 
FAQ entries.

*******************************************************

Monday, April 22nd, 2002 - The tools and level editor
for Jedi Outcast have been released to the public.  The
4MB download includes:

JK2Radiant - The map editor.
MD3View - Model viewer for .md3 format models
ModView - Model viewer for .glm (Ghoul2) format model
ShaderEd2 - The shader editor/viewer
sof2map - The map compiler, you will not be using this directly, JK2Radiant uses this.

You can download it from:

- <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?file=87277">FilePlanet</a>
- <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/files/fileshack2.x?JK2EditingTools.zip">ShackNews</a>
- <a href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/?file_id=159544">3DDownloads</a>
- <a href="http://www.jediknightii.net">JediKnightii.net</a>

I expect mirrors will appear shortly at:

- <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com">Blue's News</a>
- <a href="http://www.jk2files.com">JK2Files.com</a>
- <a href="http://www.massassi.net">The Massassi Temple</a>
- <a href="http://www.jedicenter.com">Jedi Center</a>
- <a href="http://www.jedi-outcast.com">Jedi-Outcast.com</a>

Feel free to download and mirror these files as you see
fit.  Remember of course that these are released "as is"
and are unsupported by Raven/Activision/LucasArts.

Another Jedi Outcast fix for you:

If you're getting the CL_ParsePacketEntities error in JK2
multiplayer, it's likely because you are using the cracked
executable.  That's the only instance we've seen the error.
Shame on you.  ;)


******************************************************

Friday, April 19th, 2002 - The Soldier of Fortune II 
multiplayer test is out there!  You can grab it from
the list of mirrors at:
- <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/files/sof2/demos/sof2_test.shtml">http://www.bluesnews.com/files/sof2/demos/sof2_test.shtml</a>

- Forum: <a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/cgi-bin/yabb/yabb.pl">http://www2.ravensoft.com/cgi-bin/yabb/yabb.pl</a>

So far it looks like the response is overwhelmingly positive!
I'm glad everyone is enjoying it.  Our GameSpy chat yesterday
drew a record number of chatters...more than doubling the
previous record!  Thanks, all for showing up to rap with us!
You can find a <a href="http://www.planetsoldier.com/features/interviews/ravenchatapril2002.shtml">transcript of the chat here</a>.  You can also 
find an <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/news/fullstory.asp?id=3298">interview</a> that Rick and I did for GameSpy Daily and 
read the 3DActionPlanet <a href="http://www.3dactionplanet.com/features/firstlooks/sof2mptest/">MP impressions here</a>.

A few notes:

1. For those who think the speed of the game is slower than
the original SOF, you can change the speed of the players on
the server using the g_speed console command.  You can change
it to whatever you like (for all you speed freaks out there).

2. Those wondering about the gore, keep in mind that there is
less gore in the MP version of the game because of networking
concerns.  SOF2 multiplayer will support 64 players.

3. If you're getting an "invalid game version" error message
when attempting to connect to servers, it's because you're
using the leaked version.  Shame on you.  ;)  Get the new one!

4. For dedicated servers, +set dedicated 1 is a dedicated LAN.
+set dedicated 2 is a dedicated internet public server.

Happy fragging!

Sunday, February 3rd, 2002 - Today is my Five Year Anniversary
with Raven Software.  Five years ago today I started work with
a PPRO 200 with 128 MB of RAM and a 2GB hard drive with a copy
of Windows 95 and 3D Studio Max 1.2.  I'd never seen the real
Internet before, only muds and a vax at UW-Whitewater. 

A month or so after I started, Jon Zuk and I got Monster 3D 
Voodoo1 cards from Best Buy and proceeded to put colored lighting 
into a Raven title for the first time.  God, has it been that 
long?  I can hardly believe it...

At that time, we were working on Take No Prisoners, MageSlayer
and Hexen II for Red Orb, GT Interactive and Activision.  Raven 
consisted of about 25 people, all of which actually fit around 
the table and in the chairs of our main conference room.

In the five years since I started, I've watched the building
expand twice and the team expand to 60 people.  We released
those three games we were working on, were bought by Activision
and we went on to produce Portal of Praevus, Heretic II, Soldier 
of Fortune (+Gold and Platinum), Elite Force, Elite Force Expansion 
Pack and we're closing in on the completion of Jedi Outcast and 
Soldier 2 with two more titles waiting in the wings.  

My machine today has upgraded by 10 times the MHZ, 3 processors, 4 
times the RAM, 40 times the hard drive space, 16 times the video 
memory, four versions of MAX and five or six OS's.

I had just watched the Packers beat the Patriots in Superbowl XXXI
and now, five years later, I'm about to go home and watch another
Superbowl (featuring the Patriots, no less).

It's been a good five years.  Here's looking at five more...

Wednesday, May 26th, 1999 - A new day has dawned in Kenn's World...  Last night, I
asked Michele, the love of my life, to marry me.  And she said YES!  Thank you, Michele...
You've made me the happiest man in the world!  I look forward to spending the rest of
my life with you...  You are the most wonderful person I have ever known...

Thanks to Rob "Beroge" Gee for ring shopping with me and special thanks to 
Kim "Lee Majors" Lathrop for giving me the final "get in there, son...we need
a base runner" speech.  =)  Oh...and thanks to 94.1 WJJO for playing "Rainbow In The Dark"
during my drive to "the big moment."  I couldn't have done it without all of your help...

Hey Matt!  You're next, buddy...  In the immortal words of "Nature Boy" Ric Flair....WHOOOOOOOOO!

IN LOVING MEMORY - Kenneth Lee Hoekstra (August 26th, 1937 - April 23rd, 1998)

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
