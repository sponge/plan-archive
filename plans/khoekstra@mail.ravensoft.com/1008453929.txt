Saturday, December 15th, 2001 - For someone who doesn't like
travel, I sure end up traveling quite a bit...  ;)  Yes, I'll
be out in L.A. for the next five days.  If you e-mail me, I'll
get back to you in the order the mail was received.  Thanks 
for your patience.

Saw this <a href="http://actionvault.ign.com/features/intelligence/sof2.shtml">interesting summation of Soldier of Fortune II</a> the
other day...  It's pretty cool!  A nice, comprehensive overview
of just about every aspect of the game.  

My favorite line of the article is this one: 

"Project Administrator Kenn Hoekstra has repeatedly stated that 
winter is when the game is expected to be complete. More recently, 
Lead Programmer Rick Johnson has given a release date of the first 
quarter of 2002."

What people don't realize is that in Wisconsin, the first quarter 
of 2002 is still "Winter."  ;) I've got something in my head that
Obi Wan once said...  Something about a "certain point of view?"
Heh...  Anyway, I thought it was kind of funny.  

Thanks, by the way, for signing my <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/thundarr/petition.html">"Bring Thundarr To DVD"</a>
petition.  Thundarr.com is coming soon...  Muwahahahaha!

Have a great weekend, peeps.

Thursday, December 13th, 2001 - Nothing work-related today.
I just want to say that I'm about to embark on the biggest
geek-mission of my 28 year long geek life.  I'm in the
process of securing a domain name and server setup for my
first ever fanboy Internet page dedicated to... <drumroll> 
THUNDARR THE BARBARIAN!  

Yes, that's right.  It was one of my fave cartoons as a kid 
(along with other gems like Spider Man and his Amazing Friends, 
He-Man and Thundercats) and I'm disappointed that there's 
so little information about it on the Internet.  I want to
create THE comprehensive place to go for Thundarr info.  I'm
also bitter that there's no way to get the series on video
or DVD anymore.  I contacted Ruby-Spears Entertainment about
it and they told me the rights belong to AOL/Time Warner and
the Cartoon Network.  Surprise!  They don't accept any input
or suggestions through their websites, so there's no way for
me to even SUGGEST they put it out on DVD.

So, to make a long story short, stay tuned for my Thundarr
haven on the web.  First up is going to be a petition to
release all 21 episodes of its glory on DVD.  And I expect
each and every one of you to <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/thundarr/petition.html">SIGN THIS BAD BOY!</a> ;)

It will be one of the corner stones of the site...  Stay
tuned for more geek info and a geek link to Kenn's geek
page.  :)  Thanks for signing, if you sign...

Take care,

--Kenn

Wednesday, November 21st, 2001 - I guess it's been a while
since I last updated so I have a bit to catch up on.  Let's
get started, shall we?

First of all, the official <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/outcast/">Jedi Outcast website</a> is live over
at LucasArts.com.  The content there coupled with last night's
<a href="http://www.mgon.com/articles.phtml?id=112760">Jedi Outcast chat transcript</a> should go a long way in answering
most questions people have about the game.  In the coming weeks
and months we'll be beefing up the content of the website, 
updating the FAQ and grabbing commonly asked questions from
various message boards to answer and add to the FAQ.

As you're probably aware, Soldier of Fortune II is now going
to ship with multiplayer.  We released some screenshots the
other day to accompany the <a href="http://www.stomped.com/published/big1006198921_1_1.html">press release</a>.  Most websites only
carried five of them but you can see <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/screenshots/games/sof2/20011119/">all eight here</a> if you're
interested.  We're really excited to be able to offer single 
player, the random scenario generator and now multiplayer.  

Congrats to id, Gray Matter, Nerve and Activision for finishing
and shipping Wolfenstein!  Nothing says "we're gold" like women
in spike heels and leather pants sitting on a pile of gold bars.
That's what I always say...  ;)  

Oh, and congrats to "the Romero" and Co. on their <a href="http://www.monkeystone.com/news.php">new digs</a>...

Other non-work stuff:

I know I've talked about quitting smoking here in the ol' .plan
before at least twice.  Well, this time I mean it.  I'm five
days into quitting using a little thing called Zyban to help
me.  So far, so good.  I may have finally exorcised the demon.  ;)

Raven took us to see Harry Potter yesterday.  It was pretty good.
Not surprisingly, however, the book is much better.  Sadly, there's 
only so much you can do with a movie.  I wonder what all of the
smiling parents at the theater would think if someone told them
that Harry Potter is basically *gasp* a Dungeons & Dragons module?
If they knew that, they'd probably be just like <a href="http://www.exposingsatanism.org/harrypotter.htm">these people</a>.  Huh?

I picked up the KISS boxed set yesterday.  Even if you're a RABID
KISS fan I'd recommend against the "collector's edition" of the 
set.  I don't think a cheesy guitar case and a hardcover version of
the cd book is worth a hundred bucks.  The regular edition, however,
is worth the $50.  The thirty unreleased songs are quite cool.  

I'm going to ask Santa for a GameCube this Christmas.  I'm very
much looking forward to Resident Evil, some incarnation of the
Metroid series and the other games that are due out soon.  I think
the GC looks solid all around.  I think it's the system that will
make me break my console draught of three years...

Okay, I guess I've droned on long enough.  Have a happy Thanksgiving!
Back to work on manual stuff etc. etc. etc.

Wednesday, September 26th, 2001 - I just finished compiling a 
list of all of the Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix info I
could find on the Internet.  If you're interested in seeing a
list of everything that's available, you can <a href="http://sof2.ravensoft.com/press.html">check it out here</a>.

If you notice anything missing from the list, <a href="mailto:khoekstra@ravensoft.com?subject=SoF2 Press">drop me a line</a> and
let me know.  I'll be sure to add it directly...

Friday, December 22nd, 2000 - I posted an article that I
wrote a while back on our www2 server that may be of interest 
entitled: <a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/getajob.htm">How To Get A Job In The Game Development Industry</a>.

If you're bored, you may want to give it a read.  If you

Wednesday, May 26th, 1999 - A new day has dawned in Kenn's World...  Last night, I
asked Michele, the love of my life, to marry me.  And she said YES!  Thank you, Michele...
You've made me the happiest man in the world!  I look forward to spending the rest of
my life with you...  You are the most wonderful person I have ever known...

Thanks to Rob "Beroge" Gee for ring shopping with me and special thanks to 
Kim "Lee Majors" Lathrop for giving me the final "get in there, son...we need
a base runner" speech.  =)  Oh...and thanks to 94.1 WJJO for playing "Rainbow In The Dark"
during my drive to "the big moment."  I couldn't have done it without all of your help...

Hey Matt!  You're next, buddy...  In the immortal words of "Nature Boy" Ric Flair....WHOOOOOOOOO!

IN LOVING MEMORY - Kenneth Lee Hoekstra (August 26th, 1937 - April 23rd, 1998)

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
