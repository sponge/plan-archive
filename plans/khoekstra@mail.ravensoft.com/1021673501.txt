Friday, May 17th, 2002 - A few things for
the weekend:

1. Our master servers for Elite Force and
Jedi Outcast will be out tomorrow (Saturday)
morning from 9am CST to approximately 1pm,
depending on how our network maintenance
goes.  Just so you know.  Originally it was
slated for last week Saturday, but had to
be delayed.

2. For those of you unhappy with the increased
saber blocking in CTF and FFA modes in the 1.03 
patch for Jedi Outcast, you can turn off the 
changes by setting the CVAR g_saberTraceSaberFirst 
to "0" in your server configs.  Setting this
to "1" = More Blocking, "0" = Less Blocking. It
defaults to "1" in 1.03.

Have a great weekend, everyone!

********************************************

Tuesday, May 7th, 2002 - The 1.03 patch for
Jedi Outcast has been posted over at 
LucasArts' website.  You can grab the 
patch here:

- <a href="http://support.lucasarts.com/patches/jedioutcast.htm">Jedi Outcast 1.03 Patch</a>

If you're having problems installing the
patch and you get the error "Directory is
Invalid! Target files could not be created"

I have a few suggestions for you:

1. If you're using a pirated copy of the game,
don't.  :)  That's one cause of the error.

2. IF any of the patched files are marked READ ONLY 
this message will appear.  Since some people have 
uninstalled, my guess would be that people have their 
own assets2.pk3 that doesn’t get uninstalled and it 
is marked READ ONLY.

3. IF the launcher or JK2 is running, then this will 
happen.  Re-booting may help

If all else fails, you can uninstall the game,
re-install it to a custom directory like
c:jk2 and it will re-write the registry
entries and the patch will install fine.

Updated Linux and Win32 Dedicated servers
are also available.  You can get them (or
will be able to, soon) at:

- <a href="http://www.3dgamers.com/games/jedioutcast/">3D Gamers</a>

On a personal note, I went to see <a href="http://www.jasonx.com">Jason X</a> this weekend.
Heh...  It was my first trip to see a Friday the 13th 
movie in the theater since 1993.  I enjoyed it very
much.  Overall, I'd rate it better than Part 8, Part 9,
Part 5 and Part 3.  It wasn't Shakespeare by any means,
but I thought it was very cool.  I think it's funny
that it made almost as much at the box office as that
awful looking Angelina Jolie movie that just released.

Go Jason!

Check out the trailer at <a href="http://www.jasonx.com">JasonX.com</a>.  ;)



*****************************************************

Thursday, April 25th, 2002 - For those of you having
some ping/performance issues in Jedi multiplayer, I
can offer the following advice:

- DON'T mess with your com_hunkMegs allocation.  I've 
seen people on the message boards recommending upping 
the number at the console.  I assure you, upping the
number will only make matters worse.

- If you have a really fast machine, you can cap your
frames per second (defaults to 85) using the com_maxFPS
command.  I'd recommend capping it at 50 or 60.

- Don't go overboard in MP games with your resolution
and game detail settings.  A great explanation of the
settings in Jedi Outcast and how to tweak them can be
found <a href="http://www.3dspotlight.com/tweaks/jedioutcast/index.shtml">at 3D Spotlight</a>.  Stick with 640 x 480.

Jedi Outcast has won a bunch of awards already as far
as reviews go.  I've compiled <a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/jedioutcast/awards.htm">a list here</a>, if you're
interested.  We're very proud of how the game is being
received.  For link and general Jedi Outcast resources,
don't forget to check out our <a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/jedioutcast/">JO Resource Page</a>.

A bit of a geek thrill for me...  I did an interview
recently with Joe Ruby and Ken Spears over at my
<a href="http://www.thundarr.com/downloads.html">Thundarr.com website</a>.  It's kind of nice to be on
the other side of the interview chair for a while. ;)
Give it a read.  There's some interesting stuff in
there.  Especially when you see what those guys are
working on now.  Heh...

*******************************************************

Monday, April 22nd, 2002 - The tools and level editor
for Jedi Outcast have been released to the public.  The
4MB download includes:

JK2Radiant - The map editor.
MD3View - Model viewer for .md3 format models
ModView - Model viewer for .glm (Ghoul2) format model
ShaderEd2 - The shader editor/viewer
sof2map - The map compiler, you will not be using this directly, JK2Radiant uses this.

You can download it from:

Feel free to download and mirror these files as you see
fit.  Remember of course that these are released "as is"
and are unsupported by Raven/Activision/LucasArts.

Another Jedi Outcast fix for you:

If you're getting the CL_ParsePacketEntities error in JK2
multiplayer, it's likely because you are using the cracked
executable.  That's the only instance we've seen the error.
Shame on you.  ;)


******************************************************

Friday, April 19th, 2002 - The Soldier of Fortune II 
multiplayer test is out there!  You can grab it from

So far it looks like the response is overwhelmingly positive!
I'm glad everyone is enjoying it.  Our GameSpy chat yesterday
drew a record number of chatters...more than doubling the
previous record!  Thanks, all for showing up to rap with us!
You can find a <a href="http://www.planetsoldier.com/features/interviews/ravenchatapril2002.shtml">transcript of the chat here</a>.  You can also

read the 3DActionPlanet <a href="http://www.3dactionplanet.com/features/firstlooks/sof2mptest/">MP impressions here</a>.

A few notes:

1. For those who think the speed of the game is slower than
the original SOF, you can change the speed of the players on
the server using the g_speed console command.  You can change
it to whatever you like (for all you speed freaks out there).

2. Those wondering about the gore, keep in mind that there is
less gore in the MP version of the game because of networking
concerns.  SOF2 multiplayer will support 64 players.

3. If you're getting an "invalid game version" error message
when attempting to connect to servers, it's because you're
using the leaked version.  Shame on you.  ;)  Get the new one!

4. For dedicated servers, +set dedicated 1 is a dedicated LAN.
+set dedicated 2 is a dedicated internet public server.

Happy fragging!

**************************************************************

Thursday, March 28th, 2002 - I just pre-ordered my collector's
edition of Jedi Outcast from EBWorld.  In most cases, it's $59.99
but EBWorld has a painless $10 mail-in rebate.  Not bad!  One of
the guys bought a collector's edition today and I must say it's
pretty sweet stuff.  You can get one <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=216704">here</a>.

I haven't had chance to put together a FAQ yet for Jedi Outcast
but here are some support tips for you right off the bat:

1. If you get the "Could Not Open GL Subsystem" error, it's 
because either your video card isn't 100% open GL compatible
or because you need new drivers.  If you have any card released
in the last two years (GeForce anything, Radeon etc.) and you
get the error, it's driver related.  For a great list of drivers,
check out: <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/hw/Binaries/drivers.html">http://www.voodooextreme.com/hw/Binaries/drivers.html</a>.

2. I've seen some performance-related issues pop up on the
message boards as well.  The most likely cause of this is the
tendency of people to crank things up as high as they will go
just because they can.  Don't worry, I do this too...  My
recommendations for improving performance in Jedi Outcast:

a) Update all of your video, sound and directX drivers to
make sure you have the latest, greatest versions.  There's a
list of all supported hardware as well as the tested drivers in
C:Program FilesLucasArtsStar Wars JK II Jedi OutcastInstall	rouble.rtf

b) Turn off all background applications including e-mail, ICQ,
and especially virus scanners.  Some virus scanners really do
check everything and this can kill load times and performance.

c) Don't play in resolutions higher than 800X600 on anything
short of "uber hardware."  JK2 is a hardware intensive game and
if you crank everything as high as it will go, you can overheat
your video card and/or your processor.  That will cause lock-ups
and performance problems.  Taking the side of the case off for
extra ventilation is another option to avoid this.  Be careful
with AMD machines, though.  Sometimes taking the case off makes
matters worse depending on how ventilation is set up.

3. Load times...  I've seen some people mentioning problems with
load times.  The key here is to be objective in analyzing your
system's capabilities before cranking everything up.  To check
this, we did the following test analysis:

All tests were run from the release copy, and dropping out of the 
executable and re-running for each graphic setting change (and 
waiting for any hard drive accessing to cease before starting next 
test). The only settings we altered were choosing the 4 predefined 
video settings at the top of the video screen. Nothing else was 
touched at all.

All tests stopwatched from console command "map kejim_base" to 
seeing "datapad updated" onscreen.

P3 / 1GHZ / 512MB / GeForce3 64MB

VideoSetting	Load time	Reload Time (same timing method)
=================================================
HighQuality	1:15		0:04
Normal		0:38		0:04
Fast		0:31		0:03
Fastest		0:29		0:03

P2 / 300MHZ / 128MB / TNT1 16MB  (low-end machine, but for comparison)

HighQuality	6:00		0:55	
Normal		2:55		0:42
Fast		1:52		0:20
Fastest		1:45		0:15

Ram is the biggest helper for load times as is video memory.
If you have 256MB of RAM or more and a 32MB or 64MB video
card, load times shouldn't be an issue at all.

If I see any other issues, I'll try to address them.  In the
meantime, Jedi Outcast has some of the most comprehensive help
files and diagnostic tools I've ever seen in a game, courtesy
of Activision and LucasArts.  Use them!  You can find the help
files in: C:Program FilesLucasArtsStar Wars JK II Jedi OutcastInstall
and as part of the launcher screen.

If you have issues, be sure to visit "Yoda's Help Desk" over at
LucasArts.com as they are handling support for the game.  I will
try to put support things here and I plan to make a FAQ soon to
collect all of the info.  I'll keep you posted.  In the meantime,
<a href="http://support.lucasarts.com">http://support.lucasarts.com</a> is the place to go!

Thanks for the outpouring of positive feedback we've gotten so
far!  I'm glad everyone is enjoying the game!

**************************************************************


Sunday, February 3rd, 2002 - Today is my Five Year Anniversary
with Raven Software.  Five years ago today I started work with
a PPRO 200 with 128 MB of RAM and a 2GB hard drive with a copy
of Windows 95 and 3D Studio Max 1.2.  I'd never seen the real
Internet before, only muds and a vax at UW-Whitewater. 

A month or so after I started, Jon Zuk and I got Monster 3D 
Voodoo1 cards from Best Buy and proceeded to put colored lighting 
into a Raven title for the first time.  God, has it been that 
long?  I can hardly believe it...

At that time, we were working on Take No Prisoners, MageSlayer
and Hexen II for Red Orb, GT Interactive and Activision.  Raven 
consisted of about 25 people, all of which actually fit around 
the table and in the chairs of our main conference room.

In the five years since I started, I've watched the building
expand twice and the team expand to 60 people.  We released
those three games we were working on, were bought by Activision
and we went on to produce Portal of Praevus, Heretic II, Soldier 
of Fortune (+Gold and Platinum), Elite Force, Elite Force Expansion 
Pack and we're closing in on the completion of Jedi Outcast and 
Soldier 2 with two more titles waiting in the wings.  

My machine today has upgraded by 10 times the MHZ, 3 processors, 4 
times the RAM, 40 times the hard drive space, 16 times the video 
memory, four versions of MAX and five or six OS's.

I had just watched the Packers beat the Patriots in Superbowl XXXI
and now, five years later, I'm about to go home and watch another
Superbowl (featuring the Patriots, no less).

It's been a good five years.  Here's looking at five more...


************************************************************

Wednesday, November 21st, 2001 - I guess it's been a while
since I last updated so I have a bit to catch up on.  Let's
get started, shall we?

First of all, the official <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/outcast/">Jedi Outcast website</a> is live over
at LucasArts.com.  The content there coupled with last night's
<a href="http://www.mgon.com/articles.phtml?id=112760">Jedi Outcast chat transcript</a> should go a long way in answering
most questions people have about the game.  In the coming weeks
and months we'll be beefing up the content of the website, 
updating the FAQ and grabbing commonly asked questions from
various message boards to answer and add to the FAQ.

As you're probably aware, Soldier of Fortune II is now going
to ship with multiplayer.  We released some screenshots the
other day to accompany the <a href="http://www.stomped.com/published/big1006198921_1_1.html">press release</a>.  Most websites only
carried five of them but you can see <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/screenshots/games/sof2/20011119/">all eight here</a> if you're
interested.  We're really excited to be able to offer single 
player, the random scenario generator and now multiplayer.  

Congrats to id, Gray Matter, Nerve and Activision for finishing
and shipping Wolfenstein!  Nothing says "we're gold" like women
in spike heels and leather pants sitting on a pile of gold bars.
That's what I always say...  ;)  

Oh, and congrats to "the Romero" and Co. on their <a href="http://www.monkeystone.com/news.php">new digs</a>...

Other non-work stuff:

I know I've talked about quitting smoking here in the ol' .plan
before at least twice.  Well, this time I mean it.  I'm five
days into quitting using a little thing called Zyban to help
me.  So far, so good.  I may have finally exorcised the demon.  ;)

Raven took us to see Harry Potter yesterday.  It was pretty good.
Not surprisingly, however, the book is much better.  Sadly, there's 
only so much you can do with a movie.  I wonder what all of the
smiling parents at the theater would think if someone told them
that Harry Potter is basically *gasp* a Dungeons & Dragons module?
If they knew that, they'd probably be just like <a href="http://www.exposingsatanism.org/harrypotter.htm">these people</a>.  Huh?

I picked up the KISS boxed set yesterday.  Even if you're a RABID
KISS fan I'd recommend against the "collector's edition" of the 
set.  I don't think a cheesy guitar case and a hardcover version of
the cd book is worth a hundred bucks.  The regular edition, however,
is worth the $50.  The thirty unreleased songs are quite cool.  

I'm going to ask Santa for a GameCube this Christmas.  I'm very
much looking forward to Resident Evil, some incarnation of the
Metroid series and the other games that are due out soon.  I think
the GC looks solid all around.  I think it's the system that will
make me break my console draught of three years...

Okay, I guess I've droned on long enough.  Have a happy Thanksgiving!
Back to work on manual stuff etc. etc. etc.

IN LOVING MEMORY - Kenneth Lee Hoekstra (August 26th, 1937 - April 23rd, 1998)

Sunset and evening star.
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep
Too full for sound and foam.
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For though from out our bourne  of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crossed the bar.				...Alfred Tennyson
