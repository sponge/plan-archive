Sunday, February 3rd, 2002 - Today is my Five Year Anniversary
with Raven Software.  Five years ago today I started work with
a PPRO 200 with 128 MB of RAM and a 2GB hard drive with a copy
of Windows 95 and 3D Studio Max 1.2.  I'd never seen the real
Internet before, only muds and a vax at UW-Whitewater. 

A month or so after I started, Jon Zuk and I got Monster 3D 
Voodoo1 cards from Best Buy and proceeded to put colored lighting 
into a Raven title for the first time.  God, has it been that 
long?  I can hardly believe it...

At that time, we were working on Take No Prisoners, MageSlayer
and Hexen II for Red Orb, GT Interactive and Activision.  Raven 
consisted of about 25 people, all of which actually fit around 
the table and in the chairs of our main conference room.

In the five years since I started, I've watched the building
expand twice and the team expand to 60 people.  We released
those three games we were working on, were bought by Activision
and we went on to produce Portal of Praevus, Heretic II, Soldier 
of Fortune (+Gold and Platinum), Elite Force, Elite Force Expansion 
Pack and we're closing in on the completion of Jedi Outcast and 
Soldier 2 with two more titles waiting in the wings.  

My machine today has upgraded by 10 times the MHZ, 3 processors, 4 
times the RAM, 40 times the hard drive space, 16 times the video 
memory, four versions of MAX and five or six OS's.

I had just watched the Packers beat the Patriots in Superbowl XXXI
and now, five years later, I'm about to go home and watch another
Superbowl (featuring the Patriots, no less).

It's been a good five years.  Here's looking at five more...

Friday, January 4th, 2002 - Happy New Year!  

Thanks for the Windows XP help!  Several people sent me this link
to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/howtobuy/choosing2.asp">comparison between XP Home and XP Professional</a>.
Apparently I'm either too lazy or too slow to find things
like this on Microsoft's home page.  :)

Rock and roll!

Oh...and if you have a moment, check out <a href="http://www.thundarr.com">Thundarr.com</a>.

My New Year's Resolution to achieve total fanboy geekdom, I'm 
happy to say, was a smashing success.  :)

Saturday, December 15th, 2001 - For someone who doesn't like
travel, I sure end up traveling quite a bit...  ;)  Yes, I'll
be out in L.A. for the next five days.  If you e-mail me, I'll
get back to you in the order the mail was received.  Thanks 
for your patience.

Saw this <a href="http://actionvault.ign.com/features/intelligence/sof2.shtml">interesting summation of Soldier of Fortune II</a> the
other day...  It's pretty cool!  A nice, comprehensive overview
of just about every aspect of the game.  

My favorite line of the article is this one: 

"Project Administrator Kenn Hoekstra has repeatedly stated that 
winter is when the game is expected to be complete. More recently, 
Lead Programmer Rick Johnson has given a release date of the first 
quarter of 2002."

What people don't realize is that in Wisconsin, the first quarter 
of 2002 is still "Winter."  ;) I've got something in my head that
Obi Wan once said...  Something about a "certain point of view?"
Heh...  Anyway, I thought it was kind of funny.  

Thanks, by the way, for signing my <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/thundarr/petition.html">"Bring Thundarr To DVD"</a>
petition.  Thundarr.com is coming soon...  Muwahahahaha!

Have a great weekend, peeps.

Thursday, December 13th, 2001 - Nothing work-related today.
I just want to say that I'm about to embark on the biggest
geek-mission of my 28 year long geek life.  I'm in the
process of securing a domain name and server setup for my
first ever fanboy Internet page dedicated to... <drumroll> 
THUNDARR THE BARBARIAN!  

Yes, that's right.  It was one of my fave cartoons as a kid 
(along with other gems like Spider Man and his Amazing Friends, 
He-Man and Thundercats) and I'm disappointed that there's 
so little information about it on the Internet.  I want to
create THE comprehensive place to go for Thundarr info.  I'm
also bitter that there's no way to get the series on video
or DVD anymore.  I contacted Ruby-Spears Entertainment about
it and they told me the rights belong to AOL/Time Warner and
the Cartoon Network.  Surprise!  They don't accept any input
or suggestions through their websites, so there's no way for
me to even SUGGEST they put it out on DVD.

So, to make a long story short, stay tuned for my Thundarr
haven on the web.  First up is going to be a petition to
release all 21 episodes of its glory on DVD.  And I expect
each and every one of you to <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/thundarr/petition.html">SIGN THIS BAD BOY!</a> ;)

It will be one of the corner stones of the site...  Stay
tuned for more geek info and a geek link to Kenn's geek
page.  :)  Thanks for signing, if you sign...

Take care,

--Kenn

Wednesday, November 21st, 2001 - I guess it's been a while
since I last updated so I have a bit to catch up on.  Let's
get started, shall we?

First of all, the official <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/outcast/">Jedi Outcast website</a> is live over
at LucasArts.com.  The content there coupled with last night's
<a href="http://www.mgon.com/articles.phtml?id=112760">Jedi Outcast chat transcript</a> should go a long way in answering
most questions people have about the game.  In the coming weeks
and months we'll be beefing up the content of the website, 
updating the FAQ and grabbing commonly asked questions from
various message boards to answer and add to the FAQ.

As you're probably aware, Soldier of Fortune II is now going
to ship with multiplayer.  We released some screenshots the
other day to accompany the <a href="http://www.stomped.com/published/big1006198921_1_1.html">press release</a>.  Most websites only
carried five of them but you can see <a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/screenshots/games/sof2/20011119/">all eight here</a> if you're
interested.  We're really excited to be able to offer single 
player, the random scenario generator and now multiplayer.  

Congrats to id, Gray Matter, Nerve and Activision for finishing
and shipping Wolfenstein!  Nothing says "we're gold" like women
in spike heels and leather pants sitting on a pile of gold bars.
That's what I always say...  ;)  

Oh, and congrats to "the Romero" and Co. on their <a href="http://www.monkeystone.com/news.php">new digs</a>...

Other non-work stuff:

I know I've talked about quitting smoking here in the ol' .plan
before at least twice.  Well, this time I mean it.  I'm five
days into quitting using a little thing called Zyban to help
me.  So far, so good.  I may have finally exorcised the demon.  ;)

Raven took us to see Harry Potter yesterday.  It was pretty good.
Not surprisingly, however, the book is much better.  Sadly, there's 
only so much you can do with a movie.  I wonder what all of the
smiling parents at the theater would think if someone told them
that Harry Potter is basically *gasp* a Dungeons & Dragons module?
If they knew that, they'd probably be just like <a href="http://www.exposingsatanism.org/harrypotter.htm">these people</a>.  Huh?

I picked up the KISS boxed set yesterday.  Even if you're a RABID
KISS fan I'd recommend against the "collector's edition" of the 
set.  I don't think a cheesy guitar case and a hardcover version of
the cd book is worth a hundred bucks.  The regular edition, however,
is worth the $50.  The thirty unreleased songs are quite cool.  

I'm going to ask Santa for a GameCube this Christ
