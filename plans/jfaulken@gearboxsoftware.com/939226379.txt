Send me on my way.... :)

Heading out next week for the CPL event in New Yahk City: GroundZERO!

I'll be there Friday, Saturday and a little bit of Sunday.  I'd like to hook up with any interested people-of-the-press, or hardware manufacturers, or hot babes^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H.  I'll be demoing Opposing Force publicly (nyah, E3 doesn't count, not public) for the 

VERY FIRST TIME.

So make sure to wear your sunday best.

If you're interested in getting the scoop on Op4, or just hanging out and staring blankly into my monitor, fire off an email.

Posted some unauthorized screenshots of stuff I've been working on.

I had to scale them down a little bit, so some of it might be tough to make out, but there's some good info in these shots about what goes on over on the programming side of Gearbox Software...
