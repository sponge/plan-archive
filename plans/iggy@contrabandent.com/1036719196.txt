our site has been hit pretty hard.  we wanted to get some high fidelity screenshots out to really show the detail in this engine, so they ended up being pretty big files- 1600x1200 jpegs, averaging 4-500k each.

abducted is a 3rd person adventure game, with elements of horror, scifi and action.  i know the website is a little thin on info right now, we're due to give it an overhaul in the coming month (with alot more info i hope).

ATI sent us some love the other day in the form of radeon 9700 cards to develop abducted on.  thanks ATI!  this was much needed.
