haiku about chicken:


I like chicken
chicken is good
I like chicken





So!!!  You think your Kung-Fu is pretty good!  Fight me then!

Ok, it's getting a bit exciting now. E3 is coming up pretty quick. Lots to
do. Just completed the skin for Manon (the spiffy French resistance lady).
She looks pretty swell (not to toot my own horn or anything) just happy with
how the she turned out. 
I'd like to see Manon and Lara Croft in a fight. 
(I hear the French and the English don't care much for each other).
Been playing Black and White a bit. fun fun.  My cow rocks. Enough of this
writing stuff. back to work.

for those of you you feel the need to be informative about grammar and/or haiku form, or those who are bored enough to just want to write and tell me how stupid my plan update is....
please demonstrate your superiority  by writing to someone else, because I can barely read anyway, and I might not understand what you are trying to say.    
and yes these are run-on sentences.    

they just put me in front of this computer with a wacom pad, and a drool cup and let me skin all these characters and vehicles.  who says autism is bad??

I am the Abominable RainMAN 
I am a texture autist  

"yeah... Definetly 512 by 512 pixels>>>definetly 512 by 512"

again for those of you who have autistic relatives or are offended by that last statement....  ummm pick one of these.

a. I love you?
b. i'm not wearing underpants either
c. do you have any older sisters who might want to date a dork?... a divrced mother perhaps?
d. piss off  
e. there is no none of the above..refer to (d.)


ok kids  i'm outta heeere.    I love my plan file  and yes my plan file looooves me.


Brad  step into my office,  we need to talk.
