Work Stuff:

1) I've had to temporarily turn off new registrations on our UBB.  The user file index has become corrupt, and I'm not exactly sure how to fix it at the moment.  If you're already registered, it should work fine, but I've had to temporarily shut off new user registrations.   I'll have that back ASAP.


Non-Work Stuff:

1) Forget that DVD thing I mentioned earlier today - the price has been changed back to it's regular price of $80 some dollars.  Looks like a temporary typo on their part.  :)
