Work Stuff:

Overnight some more Max Payne demo download locations came in.  I just added these new locations to our list: Japan, Denmark, Spain, New Zealand, & Bosnia!

If you haven't checked out the demo, check out our download list - it's gotten pretty widespread at this point, you can probably find a location close to you if you're not in the US.

You can check out the complete list of download mirrors here:
