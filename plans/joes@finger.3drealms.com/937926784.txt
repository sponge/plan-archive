Work Stuff:

1) I had a single report of our web forums generating a "Hard drive is out of space" error.  If you use our web forums, and run into problems such as this, please, I'd need a detailed account of what you're doing to get the error.  Also, whether or not the error happened just one time, or if it could be repeated.  Thanks.

2) I released the Duke Nukem: Zero Hour TV commercial a couple of days ago on the 3D Realms web site in both MPG and RealVideo formats.  Check it out, it's pretty funny.

Other Stuff:

1) The full trailer for the new James Bond flick, "The World is Not Enough" (Nov 19, 1999) is out now.  I've read it's in front of the movie Stigmata, but you can download it from the official 007 site at (surprise) http://www.jamesbond.com.   Check it out, it's way cool.

CD's I'm listening to:

1) Megadeth - Risk (They've mellowed a bit, but still good stuff)
2) Queensryche - Q2K (Their heavist/best album since Mindcrime, I think)
3) The Cage - (Dario Mollo's project with Tony Martin - great Italian guitarist)
4) Queensyche - Operation Mindcrime
