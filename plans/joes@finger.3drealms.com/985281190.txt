I know this is kind of an odd request, but does anyone who is reading this have old baseball games on videotape?  Specifically, I'm looking to find out if the 1980 series between the Philadelphia Phillies & Houston Astros is on tape anywhere.  That's probably the best baseball I've ever seen in my life, and I was wondering if anyone had it.

Thanks.
