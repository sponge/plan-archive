Is anyone familiar with the program Favorg?  It's a program where you can update the icons in your Windows favorites, as well as correct them if they've moved/forwarded/etc..

Anyway, since I've gone to Windows XP, I can't get this program to work.  It can find my favorites OK (in their new XP location), but it doesn't "do" anything when I tell it to start updating my favorites.

Anyone run into this?  If so, how did you fix it?   Or, is there an alternate program available to do this?
