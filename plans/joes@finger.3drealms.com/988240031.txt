Work Stuff:

1) There's an audio interview with me online today over at eUniverse Live.  In it I talk about several things including game news sites and the problems they're currently having, as well as some non game related things like TiVo, Napster, and other stuff.  You can check it out here:

There's going to be a part two with me in two weeks.


Non Work Stuff:

1) I know this is kind of an odd request, but does anyone who is reading this have old baseball games on videotape?  Specifically, I'm looking to find out if the 1980 series between the Philadelphia Phillies & Houston Astros is on tape anywhere.  That's probably the best baseball I've ever seen in my life, and I was wondering if anyone had it.  I'm talking about the entire series, not just one game.


CD's I've been listening to lately:

1) Hall & Oates: Greatest Hits
2) Black Sabbath: Heaven & Hell
3) Halford: Resurrection
4) Iron Maiden: Brave New World
5) AC/DC: Stiff Upper Lip
