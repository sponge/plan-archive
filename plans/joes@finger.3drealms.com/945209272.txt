Work Stuff:

1) I posted the past three Camera Captioning Contest winners this afternoon.  Launch of the web site will be delayed slightly, so I wanted to get these online now.  That brings the camera contest up current.  BTW, I looked over submissions for the current contest, and there's some good stuff in there.

2) Been playing both UT & Q3A.  People who slag one off as "it sucks" really bug me.  There's things to like in both these games.  To quote a phrase..  "Can't we just get along?"  There's things to like in both these games.  People seem to spend far too much time just insulting the crap out of something that doesn't exactly fit "their cup of tea"?   Seems like a big waste of time to me - you should enjoy both of them, as there's things to enjoy in both.


Non Work Stuff:

1) Thanks to all who replied about the Cup of Christmas Tea thing.  I ended up writing to the book's author, who told me where I could call to find out who in my area sells the stuff.

2) Hospitals suck.  Spent all of yesterday in a doctor's office & a hospital (as well as having my cat in the Vet's office).  Very stressful day for me.  To make matters worse, I have to go back tomorrow!


CD's I'm listening to:

1) The World is not Enough Soundtrack
2) Santana - Supernatural (this is AWESOME)
3) Queensryche - Q2K
4) Hepcat - Right on Time
