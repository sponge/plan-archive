Just found out today that Phil Katz, the author of PKZip / PKUnzip and owner of PKWare (the guy who invented the Arc / Zip file formats if I remember correctly) has died.

From someone who cut his teeth on things like PCBoard, Wildcat, RBBS, 2400 baud modems, I know very well this guy (well, not personally, but I know his product).  Rather surprised to see this, as he was 37, and that's only 2 years more than me!

Here's a link to a short story about his passing away:
