OK, I now know what the Bill Cosby thing is - I've had a lot of emails, including several people who just took it upon themseleves to mail me an MP3.  That swamped my email box, please don't do that again.  :)

Work Stuff:

1) I had a really great response to the Keen article I wrote before I went away on vacation.  I was really pleased with the way it turned out.  I'm grateful to the entire original Keen team - all of them contributed new (as well as old) stuff to the article.  If you haven't checked it out, go head over to http://www.3drealms.com/keenhistory/index.html

2) If you haven't checked it out yet, check out the Duke / Lara cover pictures I posted to our site yesterday.  Makes a good Windows background.  :)


Non-Work Stuff:

1) Is anyone familar with Bill Cosby's standup work? There's an old routine of his where he talks about taking care of the kids himself, and in the middle of it he sings

"Dad is great - he gives us chocolate cake".

Anyone know the name of this piece? Went looking for it, and couldn't find it.

2) Just yesterday I picked up the Blue Man Group "Audio" CD.  Man, this is great.  George tells me that the Duke team saw them live in Vegas the last time they went out there for DNF research.  Over the holidays, the Jay Leno show reran an episode with Robin Williams when his Bicentennial Man (another great movie) came out - and BMG was on there.  Anyway, I had forgotten that I liked BMG, and checked out their CD.  It's damn good stuff - very pleased with it.

They kind of remind me of Stomp in a way, although not quite the same.

Other CD's I'm listening to:

1) Blue Man Group - Audio
2) The Beatles - 1
3) Roger Waters - In The Flesh Live
4) Iron Maiden - Brave New World
5) Queensryche - Greatest Hits
6) Wayanay Inca - Enchanted Feelings
