Work Stuff:

1) Today I finished data conversion (3 days behind schedule) of the web site.  Tomorrow I'm going to spend going over it for mistakes, typos, broken graphics, that kind of thing.  Then on Friday, it's onto the second part of the launch.  I'm hoping that goes very quickly.  :)


Non-Work Stuff:

1) Is there anyone out there who actively TRADES baseball cards?  I'm looking to complete the 2000 Upper Deck Baseball series - I have a few stray common cards that I'm missing.  If so, please drop me a line.

2) Noticed the other day that Amazon is now taking pre-orders for Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace on VHS (no DVD is planned from Lucas until all 6 SW movies are out). Anyway, if you're intersted, here's a few links for ya:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305750750/73407921 

The first one is the standard version of the movie (which is full screen). The second one is the widescreen "box set", which also includes (according to Amazon) a behind the scenes documentary, a book on movie art, and a mounted filmstrip (OOOoooohhh - hold me back).

Personally, I'd prefer a DVD, but if you want to buy the VHS tapes, you can do so via the links above.


CD's I'm listening to today:

1) Journey - Trial By Fire
2) Genesis - Calling All Stations
3) Iron Maiden - Virtual XI
4) Kiss - Alive 3
5) Megadeth - Rust in Peace (Their last total kick ass album)
6) Dio - Strange Highways
