Work Stuff:

1) Today is December 14th, 2000.  This is the 10 year anniversary of the release of Commander Keen 1.  It's been TEN years.  Yeesh!   I'm in the final stages of a big historical article about Keen.  Has interviews with the original team that made Keen, as well as lots of cool stuff - some of which you probably don't know.

That will be up later this afternoon.  I'm working on proofreading, and then it'll go online.

2) Today is also my 8 year anniversary here at Apogee.  8 years in one spot in this industry is forever!


Non Work Stuff:

1) If you're into Roger Waters and/or Pink Floyd, check out this CD.  It's a double live album culled from the recent live shows he did (late 99 and early 2000).  At first I thought, "you know, why do I need yet another live album with the same songs again?"  I was supposed to see Waters here in Dallas, but due to a scheduling problem, I couldn't.  I **REALLY** wanted to go, too.  Anyway, I said if they did a live album, I'd get it, and I did.  I was not disappointed - this has some great production values, and he covers a ton of  material.  He goes back to Floyd's "A Saucerful of Secrets" in 1968, covering the Floyd albums Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall, & The Final Cut.  He also hits his first and third solo albums (Pros & Cons of Hitchhiking & Amused To Death).  There's a bunch of great sounding stuff on here, so if you're into Waters, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000053EZS/73407921">check it out</a>.
