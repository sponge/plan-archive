This is kind of an odd plan file update.  I'm looking for something, and have been unable to locate it - I was wondering if anyone reading this knows where to find this.  This has nothing to do with gaming.  :)

A year ago, I bought this greeting card for my wife, and inside it was one single tea bag.  There is a picture of this tea bag here: http://www.geocities.com/dopefish/teabag.jpg

Anyways, I've been looking for a YEAR since then, and I've not been able to find anywhere that sells this card, let alone a whole BOX of this teabag, which is what I really want.  

I have found out there's a book written by Tom Hegg called "A Cup of Christmas Tea", and that looks like it is related, but I can't find that, either.  Info on the book is here:  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0931674085/73407921

I know this is a long shot, but does anyone know if it's possible to buy this "Cup of Christmas Tea" brand tea?  I really wanted to get some, and if you could tell me where I could find it (mail order or internet order is no problem), I'd be really grateful.  Thanks.

Joe
