Work Stuff:

1) The problems with our web forums last night has been fixed, although I don't know why - it appears to have fixed itself.  If the problem crops up again, I'll have to turn the forums off again until I can figure out for sure what the problem was.


Personal Stuff:

1) Thanks to everyone who sent me emails about my having to put my cat Flash down yesterday.  I expanded on the story I wrote yesterday in my plan file.  I'm not going to post it here again, but I did post it to our web forums.  If you're interested, check it out here:

2) I got my TiVo the day before my wife went out of town.  GOOD GOD is this thing awesome!  If you're interested, there's a UBB set up for Audio Video philes which has a TiVo section that's very cool.  Check that out here:  http://www.avsforum.com/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro

1) Santana - Supernatural
2) Dio - Magica
3) Billy Joel - 2000 Years, The Millennium Concert
