   In a followup to my last post (esp. the part about
certain hardware guys going the extra mile, etc.) I'd
like to add the nVidia is also coming up to show us
thier stuff.  Based on all the reports so far I
expect to be blown away by their niffty new hardware.
Can't wait!

   Happy Labor Day Weekend!  I will be vacationing in
beautiful Norath over the weekend, mostly in the
northern part of the Cazic Thule server. If you see a
character named Soramen, say "Hi... NICE LANGSEAX OF
THE WOLVES!" :)

   Busy times at the ol' Dynamix these days.  Had a
couple things I wanted to update people on... so here
goes. :)

   I think it is very worth while to say a couple of
words of thanks to the various hardware vendors that
have gone the extra mile to forge a relationship with
game developers.  This kind of synergy can really
make life easier for the hardware guys, the software
guys, and (to no small degree) makes for a better end
product and a better experiece for the gaming public.
Here at Dynamix we have had great meetings lately
with Intel and ATI.  Very shortly we will have
similar visits from 3Dfx and AMD.  The extra effort
that these guys are putting forward is to be broadly
commended.

   On the development side, Tribes Extreme continues
to steam ahead at a rapid pace.  It is so cool to
have people on my team come into my office and say
excitedly "it's starting to look really cool!".  And
they are right!  TE is shaping up to be a very
satisfying product.

	The Cornman goeth!  Sad tidings, as one of the
most unique characters on the Tribes team is leaving.
Cornboy! will be missed.
