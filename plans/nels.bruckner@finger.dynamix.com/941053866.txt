   A quick update - the Tribes 1.9 patch that I
mentioned a while back (which primarily addresses a
server-side crash) took a little bit longer to put
together than I had originally anticipated. It is in
product certification now and should be available
very soon.  My apologies for the delay.

   For those seeking inspiration in times of
adversity, I have just three words - Sugar Shane
Mosely.

   As many of you have read in the news there are
big organizational changes going on at Sierra and
therefore here at Dynamix as well.  I've been through
a lot of these and they are always difficult, even if
the reasoning behind it all makes good business
sense. It's the kind of thing you just have to figure
out how to work through and move on from, for
everyone involved.

   On a much happier note, our Tribes demo has
(finally) seen the light of day.  I believe it went
live on Thursday and the response so far has been
tremendous.  Every demo server that we put up get's
instantly swamped and there seems to be a pretty
consistent 200-300 people on line all the time.  It
is very cool to see.

   Server opperators can expect a new version of
Tribes sometime next week.  The patch addresses two
server-side crash bugs that have come to light.  The
patch shouldn't effect anything on the client side.
