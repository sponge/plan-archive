   Just a quick 'mini-update' - for those of you that
have been waiting for the Tribes 1.10 patch... it's
almost done!  I'm sorry it's taken so long.  The
process is fairly difficult now, with everyone
working on Tribes 2.

   Also, wanted to mention that we just received some
geForce cards from nVidia - they came in these way
cool 'ammo can' boxes.  nVidia should sell them this
way!

   It looks like our final set of balanced missions
went out on Monday or Tuesday without much trouble.
Sorry I didn't get an update put together about that
-- it's been a very busy week for me. :)

   It looks like there WILL be (at least) one more
patch of Tribes 1.  There was a pretty esoteric
server crash bug that got addressed along with a
meriad of small cheats (and one not so small one)
that have been plugged.  Look for that early in the
New Year (once your power comes back on, etc.).

   Merry Xmas everyone!

   OK, trying to get the Tribes Extreme stuff
completely wrapped.  Getting everyone transitioned
over to T2, etc.  That process is looking really
good -- T2 is going to be that much better for
getting everyone focused on it now.

   Scott Rudi and Dave Meddish are working on
packaging up a bunch of Tribes 1 missions and
other art that we will be putting out next week.
Meddish has put together a series of 10 balanced
'competition' missions that should be great for the
various gaming ladders. These are all new, made by
Dave in the last week and half or so (he's been
busy). Scott is putting the wraps on all the
user-submitted stuff that was aimed at TE. There is a
bunch of stuff there to sift through but I think the
community will have a lot of fun with it.
