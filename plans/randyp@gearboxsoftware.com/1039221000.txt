Gearbox Software suspended development of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero
in July of 2002.  Counter-Strike: Condition Zero introduces single player
gaming to the world's #1 online action game.  Valve Software has overseen
development since July.  Gearbox is aware of and endorses Ritual
Entertainment's involvement.  After developing several Half-Life games,
Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 and James Bond 007:
Nightfire, Gearbox Software is refocusing its efforts on future technology
and more interesting and innovative game play.  Gearbox Software will be
discussing Halo: Combat Evolved for the PC and our vision for the future of
interactive entertainment at The CPL's December 2002 event in Dallas, Texas.

Any inquiries may directed to press@gearboxsoftware.com

I heard the news about William last night when I checked Jim Dose's plan
file on a whim. I had a hard time sleeping last night - I was remembering.

William was one of a handful of guys I connected with when I worked at
3dRealms. With William, mutual respect and professionalism was a given.

I came to know him long after Rise of the Triad, working on Prey.  I heard
stories about how he "enjoyed" the success and money from Triad and the
feeling was that Prey could be much, much bigger.  In late 1996, with every
other person on the Prey team leaving to start other companies or work on
other projects, he was really the only guy left. For some reason, he chose
me to get involved with him in the design of the new editor for Prey, so I
was fortunate enough to spend lots of time with William.

I remember spending afternoons with him yelling our way through design
problems with the Prey editor over the boom of his stereo blasting The
Beastie Boys.  Brian Martel always said, "The Beastie Boys are developing
Prey."

It bothers me, now that he's gone, that he saw Rise of the Triad as just a
step and Prey was where he intended to prove himself. He didn't know that
Triad was to be his most successful, released game that he had significant
involvement with.

But, I saw evidence of his success after Triad - I played with it, worked
with it.  He made neat things happen with the Prey engine, things no one
else was doing at the time. Unfortunately, other problems plagued the
project.

When I heard about him leaving the game business several years ago, I
remember having some thoughts about it.  On one hand, I felt good that he
was relieved of the unpredictability of factors he had little control over
affecting his ability to reach his goals.  On the other hand, I felt sad
that his achievements may never reach the hands of the public.

I heard from him occasionally after I left 3dRealms - Mostly him telling
me about something The Beastie Boys were doing.  It's been a couple years
since I heard from him...

I'm sorry he's gone.  I would think of him from time to time, wondering if
or when he may emerge again in the game dev scene.  I'm sorry I'll never
get to congratulate him again.

William added something to my life and for that I am thankful.  I can only
hope that he found fulfillment and happiness with his life after games.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 for the PC is now in stores.

Everybody at the office is playing on-line, so if you've managed to get the
game early and jump on-line, there's a very high probability that you're
playing with someone from the development team.  

I noticed that EBgames.com is giving away a USB adapter for the PS2 joystick
if you purchase the game on-line from them.  They say that this is only for
pre-orders, but if you order immediately you'll probably be okay.

Gearbox really enjoys this game and we intend to be playing it on-line for
some time.  We're therefore very interested in supporting the title and
improving it through user feedback.  The game has been through some very
thorough testing at Gearbox and with the "Pro Skaters" at Activision, but
there are always things players discover or think of to improve the game
that we may have overlooked.

Please send feedback directly to us at:  thps3@gearboxsoftware.com.

Game on!

Gearbox Software is celebrating it's third anniversary.

I'm very proud of what we've accomplished thus far and am extremely
excited about where we are going.

In it's life span, Gearbox Software has shipped three complete titles and
shelved twice as many SKU's.  We seem to have made a few good decisions as
we've sold a lot of units, won some awards and seem to have made many of
our customers happy.

But, we're not resting.  We're just getting started.  And we're attentively
listening to our customers to help us push forward.

From our perspective, we haven't come close to reaching our potential.
But, the things we've done up to this point have been fun and have been
important to give us the experience, the resources and the partners we need
to really make things happen as we move into new territory.  In 2002 we're
taking some great steps towards our larger creative goals.

This year, Gearbox will ship three, four or five titles including:
- Counter-Strike: Condition Zero
- Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 for PC
- James Bond title - to be named

All of this is extremely exciting to me and I envy each Gearbox developer
that gets to focus all of their creative time towards these titles.

Moving forward, I expect that we'll continue to cultivate relationships
with the folks that we've worked so well with thus far. Valve Software,
in particular, has been instrumental in our endeavors and I look forward
to many future adventures with them and their characters.

Also, soon we'll be creating new things that we hope will surprise and
inspire game players and game makers everywhere. Along the way, we intend
to attract new customers who still need a little extra effort from us
before they figure out what they've been missing out on.  It's the
responsibility of the rest of us to show non-gamers that enjoying
interactive entertainment is time well spent.

In any case, I wish everyone in our industry the success that we've
achieved over the past three years.

Happy Birthday Gearbox!

Strike.

Questions and feedback we received there influences our direction, so we

Half-Life for PS2 is on shelves worldwide.  Buy it now!  Here's some info
from a few of the better review sites to help you with your decision:

IGN - 9.1 (out of 10)
http://ps2.ign.com/reviews/15631.html
"All in all, Half-Life is the best first-person shooter on PlayStation 2
to date."

GameSpy - 89% 
http://www.gamespy.com/reviews/november01/halflifeps2/
"The quality of the interlocking plot, the ongoing madness, the insanely
human AI of the enemy infantry you encounter, and the alien mind-funk of
the final portion of the experience is all you need this side of Halo."

GameSpot - 8.8 (out of 10)
http://gamespot.com/gamespot/filters/products/0,11114,466377,00.html
"Featuring the classic single-player game, a head-to-head deathmatch mode,
and a new cooperative multiplayer expansion called Decay, Half-Life for
the PS2 is a gripping combination of superb story design, sly artificial
intelligence, taut combat sequences, and logical puzzles."

I've been getting a lot of e-mail...

Gearbox Software does not currently need any Beta testers for Counter-Strike:
Condition Zero.  If we do need testers in the future, I'll put the word out.

But I thank you for the many e-mails I've received from fans who are clearly
very excited about Condition Zero and would like a chance to have a look
before it's complete.  We've been working with the press to deliver as much
information about Condition Zero development as we can as quickly as features
and content are added to the game.  Soon, there will be a new wave of info
available on-line and in the print press.

Until then, please be patient and understanding if we don't respond to all
of your e-mail.

Gearbox Software is hiring.  Gearbox is growing cautiously and smartly, but
we are growing.  We're serious this time...

We're ramping up new projects outside of the Half-Life series, so this is
a one time chance to join our award winning talent as we break new ground.

Aside from the all-new stuff, we're also continuing work with Valve and
Sierra in the future on some very exciting projects that are inside of the
Half-Life franchise of games.  This is a rare chance to be a creative part
of some of the most successful and popular games ever made for the PC.

The resume building opportunities alone are golden, but since we foster
the sort of comfortable and productive development environment that's kept us
from ever losing an employee you'll probably be much more interested in
royalties, our complete benfits package, and many other perks Gearbox offers.

There are several positions in art, programming and level design open
and information about those positions can be found on our site:

www.gearboxsoftware.com

Game Design Theory -

Last week, for some reason, I wrote a down a thought relating to game design.
This morning I found it in a notepad on my desktop:  


> Failure is no fun.
>
> Success feels good.
>
> People don't like to fail. They like to succeed.
>
> Once having failed, people will only continue playing if they believe
> the reward they'll get is worth the investment it takes to develop the
> skills necessary to succeed.
>
> So, you need to make a promise of some kind of reward to entice players
> to keep at it.
>
> AND, you need to deliver an understanding of what kind of investment it
> will take to succeed.
>
> Typically, that understanding can be delivered upon failure.  Players
> must profit from failure.  Players must profit more from failure than
> from success because success is a reward in and of itself, whereas
> failure is an incentive to stop playing.
>
> Failure is no fun.


Anyone agree with this?

Half-Life: Opposing Force is now at version 1.1.0.6

The OpFor Linux server will be released tomorrow afternoon - I'll get some
mirrors in place before the release.

This release includes OpFor CTF (team based multiplayer action - Black Mesa
Civilians vs. the Opposing Force soldiers).  It also includes the entire
collection of All-Star deathmatch maps (Fun stuff from great designers
including Tom "Paradox" Mustaine, David Kelvin, Eric Reuter, Marin "Kndyman"
Gazzari, Rich Carlson and The Levelord).

Some notes about the Linux version:

* No CD required, just get the Valve HL server and the OpFor server
* Install clean if you can
* Otherwise, make sure you delete pak0.pak from the /gearbox directory
* E-mail zoner@gearboxsoftware.com for comments/questions about the Linux
  server

Notes about the patch:

* Deathmatch now uses the CTF style grappling hook (use sv_oldgrapple to
  revert if you liked the old one better)
* Trip mines don't block doors anymore.  Also, we fixed the problem of them
  being used as stairs
* European versions should all be good now.  Sorry about earlier localization
  issues

So, go and play OpFor Online.  If you enjoy team based multiplayer and
haven't tried OpFor CTF yet, you're missing out.  If we see enough people on
the servers, we'll create some more maps for you...

About three years ago, when Rebel Boat Rocker was shutting down and we
began creating Gearbox Software in its wake, I had some time and inclination
to think about the process of making games.

I began compiling tidbits of information and game development wisdom into
a single document.  Some of it I stole from the talent I've been working
with - guys like Brian Martel and Rob Heironimus.  Other bits came from
tricks and facts I've learned from people like George Broussard, Richard
Hilleman and Kerry Wilkenson.  Most of it just came from my experiences as
a game maker.

Since I founded Gearbox, I've been appending lines from the document piece
by piece onto the end of each of my .plan file entries.

I've decided to just print the whole thing here now for a couple of reasons.
First, many of the items I've grown to have different opinions about - a
problem that is likely to get worse in time if I don't share everything.
Second, I think that just about every other developer who's reflected on the
process of game making probably has great insignt and may want to contribute
to such a list if invited.  Finally, it's not a terribly long list.

So, below is my list of "Game Development Rules and Observations." If you'd
like me to add something to the list, feel free to e-mail me. Before too
long, I'll probably re-print everything somewhere.


(+ indicates that the item has already appeared in one of my .plan updates)


Game Development Rules and Observations

+ Pitchford's Law of Production: The accuracy of the release date directly
  correlates to confidence in the schedule. Without a schedule, there is
  zero precision in the release date.

+ Building a smaller game that is very solid is better than building a
  huge game that is broken.

- The interface to the game is an obstacle - not a feature.

- Getting feedback from interaction with the game is the whole point.
  The more rewarding, interesting, unique, beautiful and smart the
  feedback is, the better the experience.

+ The more work (installation, learning, cut-scenes, etc) a new player
  has to sift through before getting to the actual game the less likely
  that player will eventually find fun in their experience.

+ Always preceed challenge with incentive. Always follow challenges with
  feedback.  A player must profit from both success *and* failure.

- Do not follow whatever the most respected game of last year was by
  making the same game and thinking that you can do it better - unless
  you're making an add-on pack :)

+ Remember that you cannot build the game alone. Learning how to
  successfully interact with your team is often more important than
  any individual person's creative talent.

- Work with the publisher's marketing people.  They exist to sell your
  game.  If they like you and care about you, they will put more effort
  into selling your product.

+ Law of FPS deathmatch design: Always make the default weapon a hitscan.

- Sometimes design balance is bad.  Imbalance creates ease or difficulty
  which can reduce or amplify the sense of accomplishment from success.

+ Try not to sweat the little things.  Spending half a day arguing over
  the color of a character's eyes is counterproductive. Such things rarely
  affect sales, or the overall response to the product.

+ Keep mind of the big picture.  A developer who spends too much time
  perfecting a tiny piece of the game risks not being able to deliver
  the whole.

+ Focus on your tasks.  Do not allow yourself to worry too much about
  how everyone else you work with is doing (unless that's your role).

+ Things usually take about twice as long as you think they should.

+ If you can't find fulfillment in a job as challenging and rewarding
  as this one, get help. You're probably suicidal.

+ This is a really hard one:  Don't burn bridges.  You never know who
  you're going to have to work with again.  We're all usually guilty
  of this at least one time before we figure it out.

- Martel's Law of human nature: It's always fun to blow stuff up.

+ Amongst the passionate developers who really care about games remember
  that there are no perfect people, but there are plenty of perfect
  intentions. Therefore, be considerate of others mistakes.

- Treat others who seem to be slacking with the patience and
  understanding you'll need when you hit a creative slow point.

- Learn to harness the creativity of those who don't conform in the
  expected ways.  That guy with the colored hair may look at things
  differently.  This can be valuable if it can be leveraged.

- Be careful about working with antisocial peopl
