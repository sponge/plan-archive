It turns out that we'll be playing OpFor CTF on the floor of E3.  Come by
the Half-Life display at the Sierra / Havas booth to see (and maybe even
play) the soon-to-be-released official Gearbox Capture The Flag before
anyone else on the planet. Also being shown are a number of other excellent
Half-Life mods that have helped Half-Life be the most played game on the
internet.

So, if you're at E3, stop by, say hello and check out the CTF action.

I've gotten some mail asking about OpFor CTF's release date so here's the
official word:

OpFor CTF will be released either on the day or very shortly after the
new Half-Life update is released.

In other news, check out this new Counter Strike map developed by Gearbox:

<a href="ftp://jimi.gearboxsoftware.com/pub/cs_shoothouse.zip">cs_shoothouse.zip</a>

This map was developed by Gearbox Software designer Stephen "Reichert"
Palmer.  It's very tight and is intended for six or four player games.
There seemed to be a shortage of small team type CS maps, so here's a
great option for small LAN games or the smaller servers.

Gearbox opened a server dedicated to small CS games.  Right now it's running
cs_shoothouse and pa_fact, a Dave Johnson map (he created de_dust).  The
server is located at: 12.39.99.157 port 27018.  There's another server
Gearbox is running on port 27017 and you're likely to find Gearbox
developers playing on these servers from time to time.  Once CTF is
released, one of these servers will probably become an OpFor CTF server.

Finally, a few people sent e-mail mentioning that the link to the article I
had written about the future of on-line gaming (mentioned in my last .plan
update) had been recycled by euniverse.com for other daily articles.  So,
I've reprinted the article for anyone who's interested in reading it here:

Several weeks ago, I had been asked to comment about the future of on-line
gaming in the context of it possibly dominating all forms of interactive
entertainment.  Apparently I wrote a considerable essay on the matter as
it's now posted here:

<a href="http://www.euniverse.com/full_article.cfm?article_id=1">www.euniverse.com</a>

Reading it again (after having forgotten about I had written it), it sounds
like I thought I knew what I was talking about. It's slightly intellectual
and very academic, but an interesting read for anyone who really thinks
about the nature of interactive entertainment (on-line or not).

Let me know what you think...

I picked up a copy of the Daikatana strategy guide at the mall yesterday.

After flipping through the book I'll just say this:

-I will be buying the game. I can't completely explain myself, but I'm
actually looking forward to it.
-I haven't decided if I should hang up the KillCreek centerfold poster yet.
I don't know which room something like would fit in.
-The "Navy Seal Rocketeer" character pictured on page 27 of the strategy
guide reminds me of Jason Hall's girlfriend. That's not an insult - 'cause
damn, she looks like she could kick my ass.

My son (a first child who is now named Randall Steward Pitchford III)
was born on January 8, 2000. The fact that this was also Elvis' birthday

Last night, I went to the Dallas Toys For Tots Finale Banquet.  Toys For
Tots, as you're no doubt aware, is a charity managed by the US Marines
designed to provide gifts for needy children during the holiday season.

For the third year in a row, Kristy Junio (currently a contract writer
for Gearbox Software) organized local game development companies to help
contribute to the cause.

Last night, that contribution was recognized by the US Marines and the
city of Dallas, TX.

Several local game development companies and their employees made excellent
contributions.  Perhaps the reason game developers are so giving in this
charity is because we understand the importance of playing games and playing
with toys in our constant goal of enjoying our lives.

In particular, Kristy asked me to thank Duncan McKissick of Ensemble
Studios.  He, with the help of his wife, managed to gather the largest
collection of toys from Ensemble, Reel FX and US Web.

However, many other companies and the individuals who work for those
companies all made the needy children of Dallas very happy this season.
In a year where game developers have received quite a bit of negative
attention from the press as scapegoats for some of the violence in
society, it's very important to notice the true motivations behind the
developers in Dallas.  We love to play and we want to share that joy with
the rest of the world. Together, Dallas game developers contributed more
than $5000 worth of gifts. This is the largest contribution made by Dallas
developers for the three years we've been involved.  This is significant
when you consider that these toys were purchased by individual artists,
programmers and designers with their own money on their own time.  And,
let me tell you, game developers know what the good toys are!

Those who were involved with donations this year include:

Ensemble Studios
id Software
Gathering Of Developers
Gearbox Software
Reel FX
Rogue Entertainment
Terminal Reality
US Web
and The Levelord (tm)

Thanks to everyone!

Many of you seem to be enjoying the new map releases made for Opposing Force.
Note that there are still three more maps to be released this week. Watch

I'd like to give special thanks to Frank Nuccio, one of the Gearbox QA team
members for OpFor, who in addition to working with us to properly tune
the OpFor weapon placement in the new map releases is also running some
of the most competitive OpFor servers in the country. Information about
his game servers and events he hosts can be found at:

First, let me say thanks to everyone who's helped us make Op For a
success. And for those of you who panned it, the letter bomb's in the
mail <g>

From what we've heard so far, Op For has been selling out everywhere,
and we're incredibly pleased! We also seemed to have won over the review
press - a difficult task when following in the footsteps of something as
incredible as Half-Life.

Now, we're in the process of preparing some new multiplayer content in
an effort to say thanks to those who purchased the game. The first of
this will be unveiled next week. Each day, we will post a new remixed HL
deathmatch map populated with Op For weapons. If you would like to offer
this new content on your website or magazine's cover CD, you can contact
Doug Lombardi over at Sierra.

Also, I understand that there are a lot of people in the community eager
to use the new content and code we've added to Half-Life for your
modifications.  We have already released the OpFor files for editing in
WorldCraft and they are available at http://halflife.gamedesign.net/.
You will find tutorials and detailed descriptions of all of the new
entities available in Opposing Force. In addition, we are working out a
way for you to reference OpFor content (models, sounds, etc) from within
your own custom games.

Finally, Gearbox is finishing up a Linux port of Opposing Force for
dedicated servers. This should be available relatively soon and I'm sure
it will be of benefit to the on-line HL/OpFor community.

We are pleased to see the Half-Life community embrace Opposing Force and
are proud to support it to the benefit of our fans.

Sean and I are on the road for a couple of days. It's mostyly business, but
since I'm up in the Pacific North West anyway, I've dropped in on my Dad and
Grandfolks. If I don't respond to e-mail for a couple of days it's probably
because my grandmother doesn't have a fat enough pipe of fiber to deal with
all the junk sitting in my account. My Grandma actually has e-mail,
though... Very cool.

Anyway, this morning I checked my mail and found about a zillion
complaints from users having difficulty with OpFor.

I quickly recovered from the shock of so many complaints when it became
painfully obvious that well over 95% of the reports were about a problem
that is only associated with the warezed version of the game. Apparently
the guys who cracked the copy protection didn't quite do it cleanly. Heh...

If you get the "Can't find DLL API" error, you've stolen the game :)

The Frag 3 was a great.  Attendance was high and things seemed to run
very smoothly.  I'm very excited about the future of professional gaming.
Although it may be considered a let down to the patriotic in the U.S. that
someone from across the lake managed to take the purse, I think it's very
exciting for the future of competition in our growing sport. There's sure
to be some nationalistic interest in "re-claiming" the first place spot at
next year's Frag tourney.

Check out the Adrenaline Vault's coverage here:
<a href="http://www.avault.com/the_frag3/">http://www.avault.com/the_frag3/</a>
There is also coverage of the OpFor demo and new screenshots there as well.

The OpFor demo went very well. It was *really* nice to get sincere applause
from the audience throughout the demonstration of Half-Life: Opposing Force.
There's quite a bit to be excited about in the game and I'm really looking
forward to the rest of the world getting a chance to play it.

In case you haven't had a look, you may download the OpFor trailer that
premiered at the Frag3 here:
<a href="http://www.dailyradar.com/features/game_feature_page_53_1.html">http://www.dailyradar.com/features/game_feature_page_53_1.html</a>

The trailer shows off a lot of varied content from the game including
several new weapons, squad combat, the medic class, Black Ops assassins
and more. It gives a great taste of what's to come at the Black Mesa
Research Facility in OpFor and has been received very well.

In any case, it won't be long now before the completed game is in your
hands.  Half-Life: Opposing Force is coming!

This weekend is the Frag 3 and Gearbox will be premiering the Half-Life:
Opposing Force trailer on the floor of the event on Saturday evening.

We'll also be showing a demo of the game there and Gearbox developers will
be available to answer questions in a Q&A session. Sierra's sent down a
ton of OpFor posters so I'll make sure we show up with pens if anyone wants
to get signatures from the team.  We don't do this sort of thing very 
often, so if you're a collector of game memorabilia, this will be a rare
opportunity.

Also, if you're a member of the press and are going to be at the Frag 3,
please introduce yourself and I'll make sure you get a copy of the OpFor
demo sent your way. We've worked very hard to make OpFor an experience
that all Half-Life fans will love and are eager to show it off.

See you there!

I've gotten a few e-mails about the "167 screenshots of OpFor" nonsense that
was posted on GameSpot UK earlier this week. I think they were overcome with
Half-Life fever ("It's driving me crazy... I'm going out of my mind"). Ugh.

I didn't bother to look at all 167 of them, but it looks as though the shots
were all captured from some sort of video. There are some really cool ones
in there, but what a pain finding them!

I'm not going to post the link here, but if someone has the patience to go
through the shots to find and re-post the few "good" ones, that would
probably be useful to the growing community of Half-Life fans patiently
awaiting the release of H/L: Opposing Force. You have my full permission to
repost the dozen or so shots from the pile that really stand out. Those
shots aren't "owned" by GameSpot UK :)

The good news is that soon the entire game will be in your hands.  OpFor
is very close to being completed.  And, very, VERY soon much more
information, shots and other materials about OpFor will be released in a
number of different places. Some of this stuff is very cool.  Of course,
I shouldn't talk about it yet...

This is something I don't like to do in a .plan update, but I couldn't
just ignore this one...

In the November '99 issue of Family PC (Ziff/Davis) on page 121 there's
a sidebar titled "Buyer Beware". This article once again makes a case
against the sales of the type of games that our community is built around.

Here's the quote which really disturbs me:

>>>
> Family PC (Ziff/Davis), Nov. '99, Page 121
>>>
> CompUSA
>
> As soon as we arrived in the games section, Half Life: Opposing Forces
> [sic] (Sierra Studios, www.sierrastudios.com) hit us square in the jaw.
> This shoot-em-up war game received an M rating from the Entertainment
> Software Rating Board (www.esrb.com), meaning that it's designed for
> ages 17 and older.  With cash in hand, Tricia walked up to the checkout
> line and bought the software--no questions asked.  In fact, the only glitch
> in her purchase came when the cash register needed a new roll of receipt
> tape. Later, at the Customer Service desk, we played the role of
> incredulous parent and complained that nobody questioned Tricia's purchase.
>>>

What I'd like to know is this: How did "Tricia" purchase a copy of our
game (Half-Life: Opposing Force) when it isn't even on the shelves yet? 

It's must be an invention of Family PC magazine - an invention designed
to make a negative association with the games we love and to point the
finger at the business of entertainment software design and sales.

The article goes on to jab at Xatrix Entertainment, Software Etc,
Beyond.com and the South Park game after which it appeals to "Mr. President"
for "another press conference."  Presumably the objective of the writer
is to influence public policy in ways potentially bad for our industry.

Does anyone know how the law protects a company like Gearbox Software
from the press making such an injurious fabrication with malicious intent?
I am very bothered that something like this can appear in a high-volume
magazine like Family PC from a huge publisher like Ziff/Davis.

I would be interested in hearing from anyone who has some legal experience
with this sort of thing. Could this be considered libelous?

I would also be interested in hearing from someone with CompUSA on how
they might react to this since their sales methods are the primary
target of this article's attack.

Gearbox is within days (hours?) of "Release Candidate 1" for Half-Life:
Opposing Force.  But, that's not the cool news.  The cool news is that
Brian's been working with the Sierra marketing and art dudes on a Corporal
Adrian Shephard stand-up/cut-out display for the stores.

It's planned to have an animated Pipe Wrench that he brandishes... The
whole thing is supposed to run off of solar power.  It sounds very cool.

I'm going to try to get a dozen of them or so to set up in the hallway to
disturb the neighbors in the building (we're going to need their office
space soon <g>).  If you're a vendor who's going to get one for your OpFor
sales display, don't promise it out to your cousin, I'll buy the damn
thing from ya!

pre-ordering your copy now.

GDC (Game Developers Conference) Road Trips is coming to Austin, TX next
month.  All developers nearby should make a point of attending this year
as there are a number of great speakers including folks from id Software,
Origin, Ensemble, Looking Glass and more.

These events are typically a lot of fun.  I remember the first GDC road
trips in Austin when Ritual chartered a bus where I joined some of the old
RBR crew and a bunch of the other Dallas game developers to ride down to
see our captain, Billy Zelsnack, speak about the unique stuff he was doing
with Java in the Prax War engine.  I met a bunch of notable developers for
the first time during that trip.

Road Trips are often used by speakers to test out new material that later
makes its way into GD Mag. or technical papers and/or books...  It's a
good chance to learn tricks and things leading game developers are playing
with that hasn't been shared yet.

Today Gearbox and Sierra studios have announced four more of the all-star
level designers for the multiplayer portion of Half-Life: Opposing Force.

I'm sure you'll agree that these designers represent some of the best talent
in the business and I'm looking forward to deathmatching in their maps as
much as Half-Life fans are.

Check out the full press release below...

I personally have a great deal of respect for each designer we've invited
to be part of the All-Star group and suspect that the action gaming
community feels the same way.  Only a title like Half-Life could gather as
many accomplished level makers like this together for the OpFor multiplayer
game.  Even though this rare collection of designers alone is enough to make
OpFor a collectors item, I'm going to try to get all of the "All Stars" to
sign my copy after we go gold.  What do you think I could get for that
on E-Bay? I know it's no kidney, but... Hey! look... Levelord!

I would like to point out that there will be more announcements soon
describing the last group of all-stars and the winners of the Team Fortress
Classic level design contest who's maps will be included with Half-Life:
Opposing Force.

In fact, we're going to start playing the TFC entries next week to choose

Bellevue, WA (September 10, 1999) - Sierra Studios, Gearbox Software and
Valve are proud to announce four additional members of the industry
"All-Star" team designing the multiplayer portion of the upcoming PC
title, Half-Life(tm): Opposing Force(tm), the entirely new episode for
the Game of the Year.

The four veteran designers announced today are: Richard "Zdim" Carlson,
David "Kevlar" Kelvin, Marin "Kandyman" Gazzari, and Eric Reuter. They
join the team along with Richard "Levelord(tm)" Gray, who announced his
participation earlier this summer.

"Gearbox is obviously very excited to be working with such an amazing
team of talented designers on Op For," says Randy Pitchford, co-founder
and lead game designer at Gearbox. "It also adds a degree of suspense as
we are waiting just as anxiously as everyone else to see what kind of
amazing maps they put together for us to play."

About the All-Stars:

Richard "Zdim" Carlson
Growing from being one of the most respected amateur designers of the
Doom and Heretic era, Carlson defined unique black and white sections of
Ion Storm's upcoming epic RPG Anachronox. He then contributed to John
Romero's Daikatana before making the move to Looking Glass Studios where
he is a pivotal designer for the upcoming Thief 2.

David "Kevlar" Kelvin
Aside from being a very visible member of the early 3D level design
community, Kelvin was a member of Team Evolve creating several missions
for the Quake II Zaero pack. He spent a short time at Monolith contributing
maps for Blood II and Shogo before joining Legend Entertainment where
he has shipped Unreal: Return to NaPali and is currently working on
Wheel of Time.

Marin "Kandyman" Gazzari
Austrian Marin Gazzari is probably the most respected deathmatch level
designer of the era. His simple yet perfectly flowing designs have been
the setting for countless tournament and clan matches. Although he is
probably best known for his work with Quake's ZerStoerer pack, his "kndy"
series of deathmatch maps are among the most played maps ever created.

Eric Reuter
One of the most accomplished designers of the Opposing Force "All Stars,"
Eric is currently the lead level builder of Unreal PlayStation which will
offer a completely new single player episode. Eric was a designer with
the original Unreal team after working with 3dRealms on Shadow Warrior.
Eric became a professional designer after his early level work for Doom
found its way into the SAM'S published books "Tricks of the Doom Programming
Gurus" and "3D Game Alchemy."

Half-Life: Opposing Force (a.k.a. Op For) will feature over one dozen new
multiplayer levels created by 3-D action industry All Stars. Op For also
features an expansive new single player episode were players return to
the Black Mesa Research Facility from the exciting new perspective of a
soldier to eliminate a new breed of fierce aliens. The title, which is
being developed by Gearbox Software, is on schedule to ship this fall.

public sees that too.

It's funny how polls like this seem to get the competive urge rolling and
all the developers go vote for their own games.

Obviously the more honest votes this thing gets, the more useful it will be.
I'm not saying that some groups of people are screwing up the results, but
I will go out on a limb and suggest that there's no f'n way that Monolith's
"Sanity" is more highly anticipated at this point than "Unreal Tournament."

So, go vote for whatever game you're looking forward to most this season.

Also, don't just vote for Half-Life: Opposing Force because I made this
post... Vote for OpFor if it honestly is a game you're looking forward to.

There's a bunch of new screenshots included with the article that show off

The preview ends with: "Opposing Force will be the mother of all expansions."

Thanks, Next Generation On-Line!

When you haven't recorded voices for a new alien in your game but want
place holder stuff, I highly recommend using sound bytes of Greedo.

Because of creative coder, John Faulkenbury, and sound guru, Rob
Heironimus, our Shock Trooper for Half-Life: Opposing Force currently
speaks Greedo and is the funniest thing I have ever heard in my entire
life.

It's just too bad we can't leave it in :)  Anyone know Lucas?

A few days ago, I was demonstrating a build of Opposing Force to some
nice folks with Imagine (the dudes that publish Next Generation, PC
Gamer and PC Accelerator magazines).

Anyway, I was running around in a test map the coders created that
demonstrates the new squad combat we've been developing for Half-Life. In
a nutshell you can gather up a squad of seven AI soldiers (including a
medic) and lead them into battle with a horde of Shock Troopers and
Voltigores (just a couple of the many new aliens in Op For).

It is very cool and all, but the AI squad vs. squad combat isn't what
suprised me.  I'd spent hours skirmishing in this map long before the
demo I gave on Wednesday.  But, this latest version had the new medic 
soldier working like a medic.  He's designed to join your squad and heal
those who are injured.  Right now it sort of works like a walking wall
health unit, except that the walking wall health unit is actually a
soldier who can talk with you, follow you and fire his .357 Desert Eagle
at enemies.  It's very cool, indeed.

But, the medic was literally dropped into the game the night before the
demo, so I was looking at it for the first time when I was demoing it to
the press dudes.

Anyway, as I'm doing the demo, I run through a skirmish with my friendly
soldier squad attacking the horde of aliens and me running back for
healing from the medic whenever I get too injured.

The medic happens to be a tough looking black dude.  I was admiring the
paint job on the model when one of the press dudes asks me to restart the
map again to try something different in the battle to see what the outcome
would be - or something like that. 

So I restart the map and immediately go into the room where the medic
is waiting and everyone in the room (including me) is suprised to see
that the medic looks different.  There's another version of the medic!
Instead of the tough looking black dude, he now looks a lot like the
"Joker" character from "Full Metal Jacket".

I think one of the press dudes said something like, "Whoa... He's different
now. You guys have variations on these guys!"

And I was like, "Oh yeah. (concealed suprise) Our art deparment is trying
to make sure that no two NPC's in the game look alike."

Anyway, to make a long story short, many people have asked why all the
scientists and security guards throughout the Black Mesa facility look
alike.  The answer, of course, is cloning.

Kidding aside, the answer has a lot to do with memory constraints, artist
resources, and other complicated issues relating to the development process.

However, since Gearbox has the opportunity to go back and essentially
make Half-Life an even better experience with the Opposing Force expansion
we can do things like that.  I'm not sure we'll have time or space to
make every single NPC in the game unique, but we'll be pretty close.

So, there's many versions of each type of soldier.  There's many versions
of just about every character.  And, as developers we're pleased to know
that our time has been worth it.

Because, it was a very cool thing to get a reaction like Op For did from
a group of the most important editors in the game press.

Rob performed the most insane move ever conceivable in Q3Test. And now,
for a limited time it is "CAUGHT ON TAPE." You must see this to believe it.
