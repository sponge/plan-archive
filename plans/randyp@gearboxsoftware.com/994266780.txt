Gearbox Software is hiring.  Gearbox is growing cautiously and smartly, but
we are growing.  We're serious this time...

We're ramping up new projects outside of the Half-Life series, so this is
a one time chance to join our award winning talent as we break new ground.

Aside from the all-new stuff, we're also continuing work with Valve and
Sierra in the future on some very exciting projects that are inside of the
Half-Life franchise of games.  This is a rare chance to be a creative part
of some of the most successful and popular games ever made for the PC.

The resume building opportunities alone are golden, but since we foster
the sort of comfortable and productive development environment that's kept us
from ever losing an employee you'll probably be much more interested in
royalties, our complete benfits package, and many other perks Gearbox offers.

There are several positions in art, programming and level design open
and information about those positions can be found on our site:

www.gearboxsoftware.com

You can also look at the job descriptions posted on Gamasutra:

!Blue Shift for $20 with a free copy of Gunman!

At the Best Buy in Plano, TX, Blue Shift is $20 and you get a free copy of
Gunman Chronicles.  This is before the $10 Opposing Force rebate, so if
you've already got Opposing Force, you can get Gunman and Blue Shift with
the HD Pack for only $10.  Serious bargain...

If you're from somewhere else and find any good Blue Shift bargains, drop
me a note and I'll mention them here.

Game Design Theory -

Last week, for some reason, I wrote a down a thought relating to game design.
This morning I found it in a notepad on my desktop:  


> Failure is no fun.
>
> Success feels good.
>
> People don't like to fail. They like to succeed.
>
> Once having failed, people will only continue playing if they believe
> the reward they'll get is worth the investment it takes to develop the
> skills necessary to succeed.
>
> So, you need to make a promise of some kind of reward to entice players
> to keep at it.
>
> AND, you need to deliver an understanding of what kind of investment it
> will take to succeed.
>
> Typically, that understanding can be delivered upon failure.  Players
> must profit from failure.  Players must profit more from failure than
> from success because success is a reward in and of itself, whereas
> failure is an incentive to stop playing.
>
> Failure is no fun.


Anyone agree with this?

Half-Life: Opposing Force is now at version 1.1.0.6

The OpFor Linux server will be released tomorrow afternoon - I'll get some
mirrors in place before the release.

This release includes OpFor CTF (team based multiplayer action - Black Mesa
Civilians vs. the Opposing Force soldiers).  It also includes the entire
collection of All-Star deathmatch maps (Fun stuff from great designers
including Tom "Paradox" Mustaine, David Kelvin, Eric Reuter, Marin "Kndyman"
Gazzari, Rich Carlson and The Levelord).

Some notes about the Linux version:

* No CD required, just get the Valve HL server and the OpFor server
* Install clean if you can
* Otherwise, make sure you delete pak0.pak from the /gearbox directory
* E-mail zoner@gearboxsoftware.com for comments/questions about the Linux
  server

Notes about the patch:

* Deathmatch now uses the CTF style grappling hook (use sv_oldgrapple to
  revert if you liked the old one better)
* Trip mines don't block doors anymore.  Also, we fixed the problem of them
  being used as stairs
* European versions should all be good now.  Sorry about earlier localization
  issues

So, go and play OpFor Online.  If you enjoy team based multiplayer and
haven't tried OpFor CTF yet, you're missing out.  If we see enough people on
the servers, we'll create some more maps for you...

About three years ago, when Rebel Boat Rocker was shutting down and we
began creating Gearbox Software in its wake, I had some time and inclination
to think about the process of making games.

I began compiling tidbits of information and game development wisdom into
a single document.  Some of it I stole from the talent I've been working
with - guys like Brian Martel and Rob Heironimus.  Other bits came from
tricks and facts I've learned from people like George Broussard, Richard
Hilleman and Kerry Wilkenson.  Most of it just came from my experiences as
a game maker.

Since I founded Gearbox, I've been appending lines from the document piece
by piece onto the end of each of my .plan file entries.

I've decided to just print the whole thing here now for a couple of reasons.
First, many of the items I've grown to have different opinions about - a
problem that is likely to get worse in time if I don't share everything.
Second, I think that just about every other developer who's reflected on the
process of game making probably has great insignt and may want to contribute
to such a list if invited.  Finally, it's not a terribly long list.

So, below is my list of "Game Development Rules and Observations." If you'd
like me to add something to the list, feel free to e-mail me. Before too
long, I'll probably re-print everything somewhere.


(+ indicates that the item has already appeared in one of my .plan updates)


Game Development Rules and Observations

+ Pitchford's Law of Production: The accuracy of the release date directly
  correlates to confidence in the schedule. Without a schedule, there is
  zero precision in the release date.

+ Building a smaller game that is very solid is better than building a
  huge game that is broken.

- The interface to the game is an obstacle - not a feature.

- Getting feedback from interaction with the game is the whole point.
  The more rewarding, interesting, unique, beautiful and smart the
  feedback is, the better the experience.

+ The more work (installation, learning, cut-scenes, etc) a new player
  has to sift through before getting to the actual game the less likely
  that player will eventually find fun in their experience.

+ Always preceed challenge with incentive. Always follow challenges with
  feedback.  A player must profit from both success *and* failure.

- Do not follow whatever the most respected game of last year was by
  making the same game and thinking that you can do it better - unless
  you're making an add-on pack :)

+ Remember that you cannot build the game alone. Learning how to
  successfully interact with your team is often more important than
  any individual person's creative talent.

- Work with the publisher's marketing people.  They exist to sell your
  game.  If they like you and care about you, they will put more effort
  into selling your product.

+ Law of FPS deathmatch design: Always make the default weapon a hitscan.

- Sometimes design balance is bad.  Imbalance creates ease or difficulty
  which can reduce or amplify the sense of accomplishment from success.

+ Try not to sweat the little things.  Spending half a day arguing over
  the color of a character's eyes is counterproductive. Such things rarely
  affect sales, or the overall response to the product.

+ Keep mind of the big picture.  A developer who spends too much time
  perfecting a tiny piece of the game risks not being able to deliver
  the whole.

+ Focus on your tasks.  Do not allow yourself to worry too much about
  how everyone else you work with is doing (unless that's your role).

+ Things usually take about twice as long as you think they should.

+ If you can't find fulfillment in a job as challenging and rewarding
  as this one, get help. You're probably suicidal.

+ This is a really hard one:  Don't burn bridges.  You never know who
  you're going to have to work with again.  We're all usually guilty
  of this at least one time before we figure it out.

- Martel's Law of human nature: It's always fun to blow stuff up.

+ Amongst the passionate developers who really care about games remember
  that there are no perfect people, but there are plenty of perfect
  intentions. Therefore, be considerate of others mistakes.

- Treat others who seem to be slacking with the patience and
  understanding you'll need when you hit a creative slow point.

- Learn to harness the creativity of those who don't conform in the
  expected ways.  That guy with the colored hair may look at things
  differently.  This can be valuable if it can be leveraged.

- Be careful about working with antisocial people.  Often there are
  reasons why people need to build their identities around strange
  appearance or behavior.

+ Play games.  Play them as much as you make them, if you can.  Be
  suspicious of the game developer who doesn't play games.

- Game development is about decisions - often with sacrifices.  Allow
  sacrifices and you will ship your title. Sacrifice too much and your
  title may fail.  Decisions.

+ Assume there will be staff changes during a project.  Think about how
  a project can adapt if any given member of the team goes away.

+ Resource redundancy is a tool.  It can boost moral for workers doing
  a technically difficult job, but it can lower moral in a system that
  is expected to be predictable.

- Be careful about attaching a movie or book franchise to a game. The
  franchise cannot carry the product, but it can get everyone's
  attention.  If the game is great, it has a strong chance of succeeding.
  If the game is bad, it will fail miserably.

+ Be respectful of competitive development studios.  Some of your best
  talent may come from there.

- It's okay to be somewhat open with employees about where people stand.
  No one feels good about the co-worker who doesn't seem to do anything
  until they learn he's not getting paid very much.

- It's okay to be open with your employers. They'll respect you more if
  you're honest about the things that concern you.  A predictable resource
  makes an employer much more comfortable than a loose cannon.

+ Don't automatically shun something just because it's easy.  Purists in
  this business are only hurting themselves.  If a cheap tool or hack
  trick gets the job done, the job is still done and end users will often
  be just as satisfied with the end result.

+ Understand the limit of quality. Quality is subjective and can be
  endlessly pursued. Knowing what is 'good enough' is key. Remember that
  the Mona Lisa only covers 3/4 the canvas the artist originally set out
  fill.

- Be friendly and respectful to everyone you meet.  You never know how
  important someone will become in time.  This business changes radically
  very quickly.  Bill Gates was nobody in 1971.

- When you stop learning, you lose your value. Don't be afraid to learn
  from the talent around you.  Always learn from your own experience and
  by watching the experiences of others.

+ The 'formula' for a successful game is simple, but it's not what you
  think. At any given second of the game, if the player is gratified by
  their experience to the point where they want to play more, you've
  got it.

- Big flashy introductory movies based around a company logo are usually
  not considered entertaining by the player. I suppose they manage to
  make their way into titles because they help the game makers feel
  proud of their label.  Building brand recognition is valuable, but
  don't over do it - especially during the game.

+ The only thing worse than a player finding it difficult to cleanly
  uninstall or remove a program from the computer is the fact that the
  player felt compelled to delete the game in the first place.

- Try not to make extremely important decisions instantly. These often
  occur near the end of a painfully long brainstorming session and they're
  nearly always regretted the next day.

- Things only get done if people do them. Doing stuff is better than not.

+ Misdirected effort is wasted effort. Everyone on a team must have the
  same goal.  The goal should usually involve actually finishing the title
  and having it be a good one.  Seems simple, but it often doesn't work
  that way.

- If goals feel unreachable to a team, they may never be reached. Perhaps
  the most powerful ally towards a successful title is confidence. If a
  person or team lacks confidence, some sort of change is mandatory or
  the project will be met with failure.

+ All games involve challenge. Challenge implies work. Work is not a
  synonym for fun. This is the fundamental hurdle of a game designer.

- Some of the basic instincts that cause you to want to do your job (or
  anything else for that matter) are the same instincts that should be
  manipulated by your game. Human nature is what must be understood by
  a designer.  Always be aware of how your human nature drives you and
  try to put those elements into your game.

- If you know something that you can do to make the title better, you
  cannot assume that eventually someone else will ask you to do it. You
  must first make your talent and skills known to your team-mates and
  managers.

- If someone you work with thinks something in the game isn't very good,
  chances are it will bother some customer somewhere too. Conversely, if
  someone on the team really likes something in the game, it will
  probably be liked by a customer.

- Beware allowing things you do to become to precious to you.
  Remember, no matter how good you do your job, it can always be done
  better.  Someone you work with may hold the key, so constantly seek
  and absorb criticism.

- Always remember who your customers are.  Adding features or content
  that you hope will impress your game developer peers but cannot be
  recognized by the average end user is counter-productive.

- If you want to be on a winning development team, start by making your
  work environment as comfortable as possible for your co-workers.

- Our job is to create experiences that our customers would otherwise
  not be able to have.  The better we apply the unique power of our
  medium to that goal, the better chance we as an industry have of
  monopolizing the world's mindshare for all entertainment.

This week, I joined the CPL Advisory Board.

CPL Website Announcement

Gearbox Software has long been interested in competitive gaming on a
professional level and has supported many competitive events in the past
(including CPL events like the Counterstrike tournament at the recent
Babbages $100,000 CPL event).  

I hope that my association with the CPL will help Gearbox get an even
greater understanding of the issues associated with high level game
competitions to help us make our upcoming titles a more solid competitive
platform.

Since the CPL has been the leading computer game sporting league for some
time, it is best positioned to continue to push professional gaming forward.

As a member of the CPL Advisory Board, I hope to use my influence to help
the idea of professional gaming grow in ways that uphold the respect and
integrity of the Cyberathletes and their fans.

No league for any sport is perfect.  But, the league that continually
tries to improve itself, and actively asks for the advice of people who
may have means to improve it, has the best chance of approaching perfection.

Since the announcement was made this morning that Gearbox Software is
working on Half-Life for Playstation 2, I've been slammed with requests
for more information.

We are extremely excited about this project, and will be releasing more
information soon. For the next few weeks, however, we will be keeping
quiet.

Until then, look for a big scoop on HL PS2 in the January issue of

It doesn't seem like a year since Half-Life: Opposing Force went gold.
It's even more amazing to us at Gearbox that the game has been as
successful as it has.

To help commemorate OpFor's birthday, Gearbox was recently delivered the
PC Action Game of the Year award we won at the Academy of Interactive
Arts and Sciences 2000 Interactive Achievement Awards. AIAS website.

Here's a picture of the award, the case it came in and the box of the game
that earned it: *aias_award.jpg*

So, congratulations to all of my coworkers at Gearbox who helped make
Opposing Force worthy of such praise from our peers in the industry.

I seem to be getting a lot of questions about Half-Life: Blue Shift and
Half-Life for Sega Dreamcast.
Here are correct answers to the most common questions...

+Blue Shift is intended to be exclusive to the Sega Dreamcast version of
 Half-Life.  It's possible that it could eventually appear on other
 platforms (like the PC) should it be successful. Porting Blue Shift to
 other platforms cannot be considered until after the Dreamcast version
 ships. (And, yes, we've seen the petition)

+Half-Life: Blue Shift is the third official single player game in the
 Half-Life universe.  Half-Life and Half-Life: Opposing Force were the first
 two. As far as we know, no other single player games in the Half-Life
 universe have been announced.

+In Blue Shift, players take on the role of the security guard known
 as Barney. 

+Blue Shift is a complete new episode that spans about 27 levels.  This is
 about 1/3 the size of the original Half-Life.

+The new models are on average about twice the detail (polygons) of the
 original Half-Life models.  They also sport new textures and animation
 articulation.

+There are new characters introduced in Half-Life: Blue Shift. Barney's
 fate is explained as well.

+Captivation Digital Laboratories has been responsible for the engineering
 of the porting of the Half-Life code base to the Sega Dreamcast. Gearbox is
 behind Half-Life: Blue Shift and new content (including the upgraded
 characters, weapons, front end, manual, etc).

+Valve and Gearbox have worked closely enough together on the story of
 Blue Shift and the direction of the upgraded content.

+This project has been in development for nearly 1 year.

+You can save your game to the VMU anywhere in the Dreamcast version of
 Half-Life.

+Barney has a last name and you'll hear it for the first time in Blue Shift.

+Gearbox does have other projects under development, but they have not yet
 been announced.

I've gotten quite a bit of mail asking when OpFor CTF will be released.
So, once again, OpFor CTF will be released with the latest Half-Life patch.
You should expect the upgrade to Half-Life to be released "very soon".

Also, it was noticed that there are seven maps mentioned in the recently
released OpFor CTF manual, yet it's previously been reported that the
free mod will ship with only four maps. This is because three of the seven
maps a
