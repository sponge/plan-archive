I've received some e-mail asking about the winners of the recent TFC
level design contest hosted by WON.NET, the winners of which will have
their maps featured on the Half-Life: Opposing Force CD.

We received the entry maps a few weeks ago and have played them quite
a bit before picking the winners.  We wanted to make sure we gave every
map the attention it deserved. There are some GREAT Team Fortress Classic
maps among them and I'm proud to include the winning maps with our game.

So, we would like to let you know that the winners are being chosen by
Gearbox and Valve and that an announcement will be coming very soon.

Thanks for your patience, and thanks for the great maps!

A couple of days ago, a good article about Half-Life: Opposing Force
was posted here:

http://www.gameproworld.com/gpw/pc/article/0,1408,1694,00.html

I noticed that not many of the news pages reported this one, yet it
is significant because this is the first published preview of OpFor
where the writer actually had a playable version of the game to report on.

Check it out... There's lots of good info and tons of new exclusive
screen shots.

Best quote: "This year, I think I'll be heading back to Black Mesa at
least one more time." -Jason Samuel, Game Pro World

Thanks Jason!

Today Gearbox and Sierra studios have announced four more of the all-star
level designers for the multiplayer portion of Half-Life: Opposing Force.

I'm sure you'll agree that these designers represent some of the best talent
in the business and I'm looking forward to deathmatching in their maps as
much as Half-Life fans are.

Check out the full press release below...

I personally have a great deal of respect for each designer we've invited
to be part of the All-Star group and suspect that the action gaming
community feels the same way.  Only a title like Half-Life could gather as
many accomplished level makers like this together for the OpFor multiplayer
game.  Even though this rare collection of designers alone is enough to make
OpFor a collectors item, I'm going to try to get all of the "All Stars" to
sign my copy after we go gold.  What do you think I could get for that
on E-Bay? I know it's no kidney, but... Hey! look... Levelord!

I would like to point out that there will be more announcements soon
describing the last group of all-stars and the winners of the Team Fortress
Classic level design contest who's maps will be included with Half-Life:
Opposing Force.

In fact, we're going to start playing the TFC entries next week to choose
a winner.  I can't wait!

Bellevue, WA (September 10, 1999) - Sierra Studios, Gearbox Software and
Valve are proud to announce four additional members of the industry
"All-Star" team designing the multiplayer portion of the upcoming PC
title, Half-Life(tm): Opposing Force(tm), the entirely new episode for
the Game of the Year.

The four veteran designers announced today are: Richard "Zdim" Carlson,
David "Kevlar" Kelvin, Marin "Kandyman" Gazzari, and Eric Reuter. They
join the team along with Richard "Levelord(tm)" Gray, who announced his
participation earlier this summer.

"Gearbox is obviously very excited to be working with such an amazing
team of talented designers on Op For," says Randy Pitchford, co-founder
and lead game designer at Gearbox. "It also adds a degree of suspense as
we are waiting just as anxiously as everyone else to see what kind of
amazing maps they put together for us to play."

About the All-Stars:

Richard "Zdim" Carlson
Growing from being one of the most respected amateur designers of the
Doom and Heretic era, Carlson defined unique black and white sections of
Ion Storm's upcoming epic RPG Anachronox. He then contributed to John
Romero's Daikatana before making the move to Looking Glass Studios where
he is a pivotal designer for the upcoming Thief 2.

David "Kevlar" Kelvin
Aside from being a very visible member of the early 3D level design
community, Kelvin was a member of Team Evolve creating several missions
for the Quake II Zaero pack. He spent a short time at Monolith contributing
maps for Blood II and Shogo before joining Legend Entertainment where
he has shipped Unreal: Return to NaPali and is currently working on
Wheel of Time.

Marin "Kandyman" Gazzari
Austrian Marin Gazzari is probably the most respected deathmatch level
designer of the era. His simple yet perfectly flowing designs have been
the setting for countless tournament and clan matches. Although he is
probably best known for his work with Quake's ZerStoerer pack, his "kndy"
series of deathmatch maps are among the most played maps ever created.

Eric Reuter
One of the most accomplished designers of the Opposing Force "All Stars,"
Eric is currently the lead level builder of Unreal PlayStation which will
offer a completely new single player episode. Eric was a designer with
the original Unreal team after working with 3dRealms on Shadow Warrior.
Eric became a professional designer after his early level work for Doom
found its way into the SAM'S published books "Tricks of the Doom Programming
Gurus" and "3D Game Alchemy."

Half-Life: Opposing Force (a.k.a. Op For) will feature over one dozen new
multiplayer levels created by 3-D action industry All Stars. Op For also
features an expansive new single player episode were players return to
the Black Mesa Research Facility from the exciting new perspective of a
soldier to eliminate a new breed of fierce aliens. The title, which is
being developed by Gearbox Software, is on schedule to ship this fall.

Anyone we know going to ECTS next month?

Art Director, Brian Martel drew the short straw this time so he's going to
have to be our man in London doing the demo of Half-Life: Opposing Force
for all the hungry Euro press.

If you're going and know about any of the cool parties, let me know so
we can throw him a bone :)

Wow.  I feel honored that the PC Paradox dudes felt to include Opposing
Force in their poll of the top upcoming action games.

http://www.pcparadox.com/Editorials/Choice/Choice.shtml

I'm even more amazed that OpFor seems to be getting the votes!  I mean, I
know we're building an awesome game here, it's just cool to see that the
public sees that too.

It's funny how polls like this seem to get the competive urge rolling and
all the developers go vote for their own games.

Obviously the more honest votes this thing gets, the more useful it will be.
I'm not saying that some groups of people are screwing up the results, but
I will go out on a limb and suggest that there's no f'n way that Monolith's
"Sanity" is more highly anticipated at this point than "Unreal Tournament."

So, go vote for whatever game you're looking forward to most this season.

Also, don't just vote for Half-Life: Opposing Force because I made this
post... Vote for OpFor if it honestly is a game you're looking forward to.

Next Generation On-line ran a preview of Opposing Force yesterday here:

There's a bunch of new screenshots included with the article that show off
lots of new stuff, so check it out.

The preview ends with: "Opposing Force will be the mother of all expansions."

Thanks, Next Generation On-Line!

When you haven't recorded voices for a new alien in your game but want
place holder stuff, I highly recommend using sound bytes of Greedo.

Because of creative coder, John Faulkenbury, and sound guru, Rob
Heironimus, our Shock Trooper for Half-Life: Opposing Force currently
speaks Greedo and is the funniest thing I have ever heard in my entire
life.

It's just too bad we can't leave it in :)  Anyone know Lucas?

A few days ago, I was demonstrating a build of Opposing Force to some
nice folks with Imagine (the dudes that publish Next Generation, PC
Gamer and PC Accelerator magazines).

Anyway, I was running around in a test map the coders created that
demonstrates the new squad combat we've been developing for Half-Life. In
a nutshell you can gather up a squad of seven AI soldiers (including a
medic) and lead them into battle with a horde of Shock Troopers and
Voltigores (just a couple of the many new aliens in Op For).

It is very cool and all, but the AI squad vs. squad combat isn't what
suprised me.  I'd spent hours skirmishing in this map long before the
demo I gave on Wednesday.  But, this latest version had the new medic 
soldier working like a medic.  He's designed to join your squad and heal
those who are injured.  Right now it sort of works like a walking wall
health unit, except that the walking wall health unit is actually a
soldier who can talk with you, follow you and fire his .357 Desert Eagle
at enemies.  It's very cool, indeed.

But, the medic was literally dropped into the game the night before the
demo, so I was looking at it for the first time when I was demoing it to
the press dudes.

Anyway, as I'm doing the demo, I run through a skirmish with my friendly
soldier squad attacking the horde of aliens and me running back for
healing from the medic whenever I get too injured.

The medic happens to be a tough looking black dude.  I was admiring the
paint job on the model when one of the press dudes asks me to restart the
map again to try something different in the battle to see what the outcome
would be - or something like that. 

So I restart the map and immediately go into the room where the medic
is waiting and everyone in the room (including me) is suprised to see
that the medic looks different.  There's another version of the medic!
Instead of the tough looking black dude, he now looks a lot like the
"Joker" character from "Full Metal Jacket".

I think one of the press dudes said something like, "Whoa... He's different
now. You guys have variations on these guys!"

And I was like, "Oh yeah. (concealed suprise) Our art deparment is trying
to make sure that no two NPC's in the game look alike."

Anyway, to make a long story short, many people have asked why all the
scientists and security guards throughout the Black Mesa facility look
alike.  The answer, of course, is cloning.

Kidding aside, the answer has a lot to do with memory constraints, artist
resources, and other complicated issues relating to the development process.

However, since Gearbox has the opportunity to go back and essentially
make Half-Life an even better experience with the Opposing Force expansion
we can do things like that.  I'm not sure we'll have time or space to
make every single NPC in the game unique, but we'll be pretty close.

So, there's many versions of each type of soldier.  There's many versions
of just about every character.  And, as developers we're pleased to know
that our time has been worth it.

Because, it was a very cool thing to get a reaction like Op For did from
a group of the most important editors in the game press.
