This week, I joined the CPL Advisory Board.^M
^M
<a href="http://www.thecpl.com">CPL Website Announcement</a>^M
^M
Gearbox Software has long been interested in competitive gaming on a^M
professional level and has supported many competitive events in the past^M
(including CPL events like the Counterstrike tournament at the recent^M
Babbages $100,000 CPL event).  ^M
^M
I hope that my association with the CPL will help Gearbox get an even^M
greater understanding of the issues associated with high level game^M
competitions to help us make our upcoming titles a more solid competitive^M
platform.^M
^M
Since the CPL has been the leading computer game sporting league for some^M
time, it is best positioned to continue to push professional gaming forward.^M
^M
As a member of the CPL Advisory Board, I hope to use my influence to help^M
the idea of professional gaming grow in ways that uphold the respect and^M
integrity of the Cyberathletes and their fans.^M
^M
No league for any sport is perfect.  But, the league that continually^M
tries to improve itself, and actively asks for the advice of people who^M
may have means to improve it, has the best chance of approaching perfection.^M

It doesn't seem like a year since Half-Life: Opposing Force went gold.^M

PC Action Game of the Year award we won at the Academy of Interactive^M
Arts and Sciences 2000 Interactive Achievement Awards. <a href="http://www.interactive.org/">AIAS website.</a>^M

I seem to be getting a lot of questions about Half-Life: Blue Shift and^M
Half-Life for Sega Dreamcast.^M
Here are correct answers to the most common questions...^M
^M
+Blue Shift is intended to be exclusive to the Sega Dreamcast version of^M
 Half-Life.  It's possible that it could eventually appear on other^M
 platforms (like the PC) should it be successful. Porting Blue Shift to^M
 other platforms cannot be considered until after the Dreamcast version^M
 ships. (And, yes, we've seen the petition)^M
^M
+Half-Life: Blue Shift is the third official single player game in the^M
 Half-Life universe.  Half-Life and Half-Life: Opposing Force were the first^M
 two. As far as we know, no other single player games in the Half-Life^M
 universe have been announced.^M
^M
+In Blue Shift, players take on the role of the security guard known^M
 as Barney. ^M
^M
+Blue Shift is a complete new episode that spans about 27 levels.  This is^M
 about 1/3 the size of the original Half-Life.^M
^M
+The new models are on average about twice the detail (polygons) of the^M
 original Half-Life models.  They also sport new textures and animation^M
 articulation.^M
^M
+There are new characters introduced in Half-Life: Blue Shift. Barney's^M
 fate is explained as well.^M
^M
+Captivation Digital Laboratories has been responsible for the engineering^M
 of the porting of the Half-Life code base to the Sega Dreamcast. Gearbox is^M
 behind Half-Life: Blue Shift and new content (including the upgraded^M
 characters, weapons, front end, manual, etc).^M
^M
+Valve and Gearbox have worked closely enough together on the story of^M
 Blue Shift and the direction of the upgraded content.^M
^M
+This project has been in development for nearly 1 year.^M
^M
+You can save your game to the VMU anywhere in the Dreamcast version of^M
 Half-Life.^M
^M
+Barney has a last name and you'll hear it for the first time in Blue Shift.^M
^M
+Gearbox does have other projects under development, but they have not yet^M
 been announced.^M

I've gotten quite a bit of mail asking when OpFor CTF will be released.^M
So, once again, OpFor CTF will be released with the latest Half-Life patch.^M
You should expect the upgrade to Half-Life to be released "very soon".^M
^M
Also, it was noticed that there are seven maps mentioned in the recently^M
released OpFor CTF manual, yet it's previously been reported that the^M
free mod will ship with only four maps. This is because three of the seven^M
maps are under development and were mentioned: a) to show Gearbox's^M
commitment to supporting the game even after release, and b) for the sake^M
of completeness and accuracy in the document.^M
^M
If you haven't yet looked at the Official OpFor CTF manual, Gearbox released^M
it to Planet Half-Life early so that Half-Life players can see what the new^M
game is all about before the free mod is released.^M

I've gotten a few e-mails recently asking about which Gearbox designers^M
created which sections of Opposing Force.^M
^M
At Gearbox, there is quite a bit of collaboration during level development^M
not only amongst designers but with the engineers and artists as well. In^M
fact, the Gearbox artists responsible for scripted sequences (Stephen Bahl^M
and Landon Montgomery) greatly influenced the design of many areas of the^M
game.^M
^M
But, for the most part, the maps had primary ownership by one or two^M
designers who did the majority of the work on those levels. Below is a^M

^M
OpFor CTF will be released either on the day or very shortly after the^M
new Half-Life update is released.^M
^M
In other news, check out this new Counter Strike map developed by Gearbox:^M
^M
<a href="ftp://jimi.gearboxsoftware.com/pub/cs_shoothouse.zip">cs_shoothouse.zip</a>^M
^M
This map was developed by Gearbox Software designer Stephen "Reichert"^M
Palmer.  It's very tight and is intended for six or four player games.^M
There seemed to be a shortage of small team type CS maps, so here's a^M
great option for small LAN games or the smaller servers.^M
^M
Gearbox opened a server dedicated to small CS games.  Right now it's running^M
cs_shoothouse and pa_fact, a Dave Johnson map (he created de_dust).  The^M
server is located at: 12.39.99.157 port 27018.  There's another server^M
Gearbox is running on port 27017 and you're likely to find Gearbox^M
developers playing on these servers from time to time.  Once CTF is^M
released, one of these servers will probably become an OpFor CTF server.^M
^M
Finally, a few people sent e-mail mentioning that the link to the article I^M
had written about the future of on-line gaming (mentioned in my last .plan^M

Last night, I went to the Dallas Toys For Tots Finale Banquet.  Toys For^M
Tots, as you're no doubt aware, is a charity managed by the US Marines^M
designed to provide gifts for needy children during the holiday season.^M
^M
For the third year in a row, Kristy Junio (currently a contract writer^M
for Gearbox Software) organized local game development companies to help^M
contribute to the cause.^M
^M
Last night, that contribution was recognized by the US Marines and the^M
city of Dallas, TX.^M
^M
Several local game development companies and their employees made excellent^M
contributions.  Perhaps the reason game developers are so giving in this^M
charity is because we understand the importance of playing games and playing^M
with toys in our constant goal of enjoying our lives.^M
^M
In particular, Kristy asked me to thank Duncan McKissick of Ensemble^M
Studios.  He, with the help of his wife, managed to gather the largest^M
collection of toys from Ensemble, Reel FX and US Web.^M
^M
However, many other companies and the individuals who work for those^M
companies all made the needy children of Dallas very happy this season.^M
In a year where game developers have received quite a bit of negative^M
attention from the press as scapegoats for some of the violence in^M
society, it's very important to notice the true motivations behind the^M
developers in Dallas.  We love to play and we want to share that joy with^M
the rest of the world. Together, Dallas game developers contributed more^M
than $5000 worth of gifts. This is the largest contribution made by Dallas^M
developers for the three years we've been involved.  This is significant^M
when you consider that these toys were purchased by individual artists,^M
programmers and designers with their own money on their own time.  And,^M
let me tell you, game developers know what the good toys are!^M
^M
Those who were involved with donations this year include:^M

Ensemble Studios^M
id Software^M
Gathering Of Developers^M
Gearbox Software^M
Reel FX^M
Rogue Entertainment^M
Terminal Reality^M
US Web^M

First, let me say thanks to everyone who's helped us make Op For a^M
success. And for those of you who panned it, the letter bomb's in the^M
mail <g>^M
^M
From what we've heard so far, Op For has been selling out everywhere,^M
and we're incredibly pleased! We also seemed to have won over the review^M
press - a difficult task when following in the footsteps of something as^M
incredible as Half-Life.^M
^M
Now, we're in the process of preparing some new multiplayer content in^M
an effort to say thanks to those who purchased the game. The first of^M
this will be unveiled next week. Each day, we will post a new remixed HL^M
deathmatch map populated with Op For weapons. If you would like to offer^M
this new content on your website or magazine's cover CD, you can contact^M
Doug Lombardi over at Sierra.^M
^M
Also, I understand that there are a lot of people in the community eager^M
to use the new content and code we've added to Half-Life for your^M
modifications.  We have already released the OpFor files for editing in^M
WorldCraft and they are available at http://halflife.gamedesign.net/.^M
You will find tutorials and detailed descriptions of all of the new^M
entities available in Opposing Force. In addition, we are working out a^M
way for you to reference OpFor content (models, sounds, etc) from within^M

Sean and I are on the road for a couple of days. It's mostyly business, but^M
since I'm up in the Pacific North West anyway, I've dropped in on my Dad and^M
Grandfolks. If I don't respond to e-mail for a couple of days it's probably^M
because my grandmother doesn't have a fat enough pipe of fiber to deal with^M
all the junk sitting in my account. My Grandma actually has e-mail,^M
though... Very cool.^M
^M
Anyway, this morning I checked my mail and found about a zillion^M
complaints from users having difficulty with OpFor.^M
^M
I quickly recovered from the shock of so many complaints when it became^M
painfully obvious that well over 95% of the reports were about a problem^M
that is only associated with the warezed version of the game. Apparently^M
the guys who cracked the copy protection didn't quite do it cleanly. Heh...^M

The Frag 3 was a great.  Attendance was high and things seemed to run^M
very smoothly.  I'm very excited about the future of professional gaming.^M
Although it may be considered a let down to the patriotic in the U.S. that^M
someone from across the lake managed to take the purse, I think it's very^M
exciting for the future of competition in our growing sport. There's sure^M
to be some nationalistic interest in "re-claiming" the first place spot at^M
next year's Frag tourney.^M
^M
Check out the Adrenaline Vault's coverage here:^M
<a href="http://www.avault.com/the_frag3/">http://www.avault.com/the_frag3/</a>^M
There is also coverage of the OpFor demo and new screenshots there as well.^M
^M
The OpFor demo went very well. It was *really* nice to get sincere applause^M
from the audience throughout the demonstration of Half-Life: Opposing Force.^M
There's quite a bit to be excited about in the game and I'm really looking^M
forward to the rest of the world getting a chance to play it.^M

premiered at the Frag3 here:^M

several new weapons, squad combat, the medic class, Black Ops assassins^M
and more. It gives a great taste of what's to come at the Black Mesa^M
Research Facility in OpFor and has been received very well.^M

I've gotten a few e-mails about the "167 screenshots of OpFor" nonsense that^M
was posted on GameSpot UK earlier this week. I think they were overcome with^M
Half-Life fever ("It's driving me crazy... I'm going out of my mind"). Ugh.^M
^M
I didn't bother to look at all 167 of them, but it looks as though the shots^M
were all captured from some sort of video. There are some really cool ones^M
in there, but what a pain finding them!^M
^M
I'm not going to post the link here, but if someone has the patience to go^M
through the shots to find and re-post the few "good" ones, that would^M
probably be useful to the growing community of Half-Life fans patiently^M
awaiting the release of H/L: Opposing Force. You have my full permission to^M
repost the dozen or so shots from the pile that really stand out. Those^M
shots aren't "owned" by GameSpot UK :)^M

In the November '99 issue of Family PC (Ziff/Davis) on page 121 there's^M
a sidebar titled "Buyer Beware". This article once again makes a case^M
against the sales of the type of games that our community is built around.^M
^M
Here's the quote which really disturbs me:^M

^M
What I'd like to know is this: How did "Tricia" purchase a copy of our^M
game (Half-Life: Opposing Force) when it isn't even on the shelves yet? ^M
^M
It's must be an invention of Family PC magazine - an invention designed^M
to make a negative association with the games we love and to point the^M
finger at the business of entertainment software design and sales.^M
^M
The article goes on to jab at Xatrix Entertainment, Software Etc,^M
Beyond.com and the South Park game after which it appeals to "Mr. President"^M
for "another press conference."  Presumably the objective of the writer^M
is to influence public policy in ways potentially bad for our industry.^M
^M
Does anyone know how the law protects a company like Gearbox Software^M
from the press making such an injurious fabrication with malicious intent?^M
I am very bothered that something like this can appear in a high-volume^M
magazine like Family PC from a huge publisher like Ziff/Davis.^M
^M
I would be interested in hearing from anyone who has some legal experience^M
with this sort of thing. Could this be considered libelous?^M
^M
I would also be interested in hearing from someone with CompUSA on how^M
they might react to this since their sales methods are the primary^M

Today Gearbox and Sierra studios have announced four more of the all-star^M
level designers for the multiplayer portion of Half-Life: Opposing Force.^M
^M
I'm sure you'll agree that these designers represent some of the best talent^M
in the business and I'm looking forward to deathmatching in their maps as^M
much as Half-Life fans are.^M
^M
Check out the full press release below...^M
^M
I personally have a great deal of respect for each designer we've invited^M
to be part of the All-Star group and suspect that the action gaming^M
community feels the same way.  Only a title like Half-Life could gather as^M
many accomplished level makers like this together for the OpFor multiplayer^M
game.  Even though this rare collection of designers alone is enough to make^M
OpFor a collectors item, I'm going to try to get all of the "All Stars" to^M
sign my copy after we go gold.  What do you think I could get for that^M
on E-Bay? I know it's no kidney, but... Hey! look... Levelord!^M

Bellevue, WA (September 10, 1999) - Sierra Studios, Gearbox Software and^M
Valve are proud to announce four additional members of the industry^M
"All-Star" team designing the multiplayer portion of the upcoming PC^M
title, Half-Life(tm): Opposing Force(tm), the entirely new episode for^M
the Game of the Year.^M
^M
The four veteran designers announced today are: Richard "Zdim" Carlson,^M
David "Kevlar" Kelvin, Marin "Kandyman" Gazzari, and Eric Reuter. They^M
join the team along with Richard "Levelord(tm)" Gray, who announced his^M
participation earlier this summer.^M
^M
"Gearbox is obviously very excited to be working with such an amazing^M
team of talented designers on Op For," says Randy Pitchford, co-founder^M
and lead game designer at Gearbox. "It also adds a degree of suspense as^M
we are waiting just as anxiously as everyone else to see what kind of^M
amazing maps they put together for us to play."^M
^M
About the All-Stars:^M
^M
Richard "Zdim" Carlson^M
Growing from being one of the most respected amateur designers of the^M
Doom and Heretic era, Carlson defined unique black and white sections of^M
Ion Storm's upcoming epic RPG Anachronox. He then contributed to John^M
Romero's Daikatana before making the move to Looking Glass Studios where^M
he is a pivotal designer for the upcoming Thief 2.^M
^M
David "Kevlar" Kelvin^M
Aside from being a very visible member of the early 3D level design^M
community, Kelvin was a member of Team Evolve creating several missions^M
for the Quake II Zaero pack. He spent a short time at Monolith contributing^M
maps for Blood II and Shogo before joining Legend Entertainment where^M
he has shipped Unreal: Return to NaPali and is currently working on^M
Wheel of Time.^M
^M
Marin "Kandyman" Gazzari^M
Austrian Marin Gazzari is probably the most respected deathmatch level^M
designer of the era. His simple yet perfectly flowing designs have been^M
the setting for countless tournament and clan matches. Although he is^M
probably best known for his work with Quake's ZerStoerer pack, his "kndy"^M
series of deathmatch maps are among the most played maps ever created.^M
^M
Eric Reuter^M
One of the most accomplished designers of the Opposing Force "All Stars,"^M
Eric is currently the lead level builder of Unreal PlayStation which will^M
offer a completely new single player episode. Eric was a designer with^M
the original Unreal team after working with 3dRealms on Shadow Warrior.^M
Eric became a professional designer after his early level work for Doom^M
found its way into the SAM'S published books "Tricks of the Doom Programming^M
Gurus" and "3D Game Alchemy."^M
^M
Half-Life: Opposing Force (a.k.a. Op For) will feature over one dozen new^M
multiplayer levels created by 3-D action industry All Stars. Op For also^M
features an expansive new single player episode were players return to^M
the Black Mesa Research Facility from the exciting new perspective of a^M
soldier to eliminate a new breed of fierce aliens. The title, which is^M
being developed by Gearbox Software, is on schedule to ship this fall.^M

^M
A few days ago, I was demonstrating a build of Opposing Force to some^M
nice folks with Imagine (the dudes that publish Next Generation, PC^M
Gamer and PC Accelerator magazines).^M
^M
Anyway, I was running around in a test map the coders created that^M
demonstrates the new squad combat we've been developing for Half-Life. In^M
a nutshell you can gather up a squad of seven AI soldiers (including a^M
medic) and lead them into battle with a horde of Shock Troopers and^M
Voltigores (just a couple of the many new aliens in Op For).^M
^M
It is very cool and all, but the AI squad vs. squad combat isn't what^M
suprised me.  I'd spent hours skirmishing in this map long before the^M
demo I gave on Wednesday.  But, this latest version had the new medic ^M
soldier working like a medic.  He's designed to join your squad and heal^M
those who are injured.  Right now it sort of works like a walking wall^M
health unit, except that the walking wall health unit is actually a^M
soldier who can talk with you, follow you and fire his .357 Desert Eagle^M
at enemies.  It's very cool, indeed.^M
^M
But, the medic was literally dropped into the game the night before the^M
demo, so I was looking at it for the first time when I was demoing it to^M
the press dudes.^M
^M
Anyway, as I'm doing the demo, I run through a skirmish with my friendly^M
soldier squad attacking the horde of aliens and me running back for^M
healing from the medic whenever I get too injured.^M
^M
The medic happens to be a tough looking black dude.  I was admiring the^M
paint job on the model when one of the press dudes asks me to restart the^M
map again to try something different in the battle to see what the outcome^M
would be - or something like that. ^M
^M
So I restart the map and immediately go into the room where the medic^M
is waiting and everyone in the room (including me) is suprised to see^M
that the medic looks different.  There's another version of the medic!^M
Instead of the tough looking black dude, he now looks a lot like the^M
"Joker" character from "Full Metal Jacket".^M
^M
I think one of the press dudes said something like, "Whoa... He's different^M
now. You guys have variations on these guys!"^M
^M
And I was like, "Oh yeah. (concealed suprise) Our art deparment is trying^M
to make sure that no two NPC's in the game look alike."^M
^M
Anyway, to make a long story short, many people have asked why all the^M
scientists and security guards throughout the Black Mesa facility look^M
alike.  The answer, of course, is cloning.^M
^M
Kidding aside, the answer has a lot to do with memory constraints, artist^M
resources, and other complicated issues relating to the development process.^M
^M
However, since Gearbox has the opportunity to go back and essentially^M
make Half-Life an even better experience with the Opposing Force expansion^M
we can do things like that.  I'm not sure we'll have time or space to^M
make every single NPC in the game unique, but we'll be pretty close.^M
^M
So, there's many versions of each type of soldier.  There's many versions^M
of just about every character.  And, as developers we're pleased to know^M
