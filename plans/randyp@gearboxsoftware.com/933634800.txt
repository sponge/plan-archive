Half-Life: Opposing Force

When you haven't recorded voices for a new alien in your game but want
place holder stuff, I highly recommend using sound bytes of Greedo.

Because of creative coder, John Faulkenbury, and sound guru, Rob
Heironimus, our Shock Trooper for Half-Life: Opposing Force currently
speaks Greedo and is the funniest thing I have ever heard in my entire
life.

It's just too bad we can't leave it in :)  Anyone know Lucas?

A few days ago, I was demonstrating a build of Opposing Force to some
nice folks with Imagine (the dudes that publish Next Generation, PC
Gamer and PC Accelerator magazines).

Anyway, I was running around in a test map the coders created that
demonstrates the new squad combat we've been developing for Half-Life. In
a nutshell you can gather up a squad of seven AI soldiers (including a
medic) and lead them into battle with a horde of Shock Troopers and
Voltigores (just a couple of the many new aliens in Op For).

It is very cool and all, but the AI squad vs. squad combat isn't what
suprised me.  I'd spent hours skirmishing in this map long before the
demo I gave on Wednesday.  But, this latest version had the new medic 
soldier working like a medic.  He's designed to join your squad and heal
those who are injured.  Right now it sort of works like a walking wall
health unit, except that the walking wall health unit is actually a
soldier who can talk with you, follow you and fire his .357 Desert Eagle
at enemies.  It's very cool, indeed.

But, the medic was literally dropped into the game the night before the
demo, so I was looking at it for the first time when I was demoing it to
the press dudes.

Anyway, as I'm doing the demo, I run through a skirmish with my friendly
soldier squad attacking the horde of aliens and me running back for
healing from the medic whenever I get too injured.

The medic happens to be a tough looking black dude.  I was admiring the
paint job on the model when one of the press dudes asks me to restart the
map again to try something different in the battle to see what the outcome
would be - or something like that. 

So I restart the map and immediately go into the room where the medic
is waiting and everyone in the room (including me) is suprised to see
that the medic looks different.  There's another version of the medic!
Instead of the tough looking black dude, he now looks a lot like the
"Joker" character from "Full Metal Jacket".

I think one of the press dudes said something like, "Whoa... He's different
now. You guys have variations on these guys!"

And I was like, "Oh yeah. (concealed suprise) Our art deparment is trying
to make sure that no two NPC's in the game look alike."

Anyway, to make a long story short, many people have asked why all the
scientists and security guards throughout the Black Mesa facility look
alike.  The answer, of course, is cloning.

Kidding aside, the answer has a lot to do with memory constraints, artist
resources, and other complicated issues relating to the development process.

However, since Gearbox has the opportunity to go back and essentially
make Half-Life an even better experience with the Opposing Force expansion
we can do things like that.  I'm not sure we'll have time or space to
make every single NPC in the game unique, but we'll be pretty close.

So, there's many versions of each type of soldier.  There's many versions
of just about every character.  And, as developers we're pleased to know
that our time has been worth it.

Because, it was a very cool thing to get a reaction like Op For did from
a group of the most important editors in the game press.

Rob performed the most insane move ever conceivable in Q3Test. And now,
for a limited time it is "CAUGHT ON TAPE." You must see this to believe it.
