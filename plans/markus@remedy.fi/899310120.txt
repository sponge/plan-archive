Plan:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1 July 1998

I just read Jason Hall's plan update. It made me chuckle, although
not for the reasons he or anybody else might think thinks. But I 
really can say that I enjoy working in an organization, which is 
flexible and still gets the thing done (=the game).

About Paul Schuytema's "bliss games". These games have given me
most bliss.
- Wing Commander II
- maybe Tie Fighter
Both of these made me dream about being a fighter pilot :), and 
especially WC2 instilled some emotions -- although I was a lot 
younger then.

Remedy's benchmark subsidiary, Futuremark, opened new web pages.
Go check them out at http://www.futuremarkcorp.com. They're still
quite limited in content but it will increase over time.

Slowly but surely DX6 beta finds its way to all computers here at 
the office. We're now again in the "are there any new drivers" 
period... Fortunately our technology transition is going quite
smoothly, with minimum impact on Max Payne (as it is not in
such a hurry to get DX6 stuff implemented). Unfortunately that
is not true with Futuremark's products... They need DX6 yesterday.

If it would just be the DX6 stuff, life would be extra easy. 
We have a new geometry pipeline, and a new material system, both
needed to get most out of 3D accelerators. With tight release
schedules, it all gets into a nice mess which takes a few meetings
to sort out. 

Anyway, after todays meeting I'm feeling very confident that
we'll get everything done in time, and in the right order.

Anybody getting to keep any summer vacation? Not me. Maybe a day
here and there but nothing more extensive. Welcome to the world
of games development and responsibility.
