For all you "worried" TNT owners asking about DirectX 5 compatibility
mode driver setting and higher performance in 3DMark 99. Some results
on a P2-400:
		Default		Dx5 comp mode	
Race		34.6		42.6
First Person	36.7		32.0
Fill Single	76.6		143.2
Fill Multi	140.1		144.6

Whoa! What's happening here? 

It's really simple if you think about it for a while. Short explanation:
Their current driver can't mix single and multi-texturing and fetch
always two texels per clock. It's either two texels/clock multitexturing
(default, DX6) or two texels/clock single-texturing (dx5 compatibility 
mode on!)

The reduced frame rate in the first person test with DX5 comp mode is due 
to the fact that although the fill rate is the same, the screen is rendered
two times (instead of one when multi-texturing), meaning that all triangles
are processed two times.

Happy? Now go get your TNT. Turn on DX5 compatibility mode for ultimate
Incoming / Forsaken speed and use the defaults for Quake & Unreal fragging!

First off, there's been quite a lot of talk about Voodoo 3. Clearly 
from the info available it's an evolutionary, not a revolutionary 
step. But it's quite nice step anyhow. The best side is that they've
got it running and the drivers are quite nice already based on what
news we heard from Comdex. As lots of other game developers have
commented, the up side is the nice fill rate. I had hoped 
for larger than 256x256 texture support.. DOH! Also, I hope the separate
texture memory limitation Voodoo2 has is gone.

Oh, there's a nice review of 3DMark 99 at:
http://www.planetriva.com/reviews/games/3dmark/page-1.htm 

One thing that got me saying DOH! was Mercury Research's benchmark results.

Check these out (from their press release):

Futuremark 3Dmark Results (run on P2-400/64MB)

S3 Savage 3D (AGP)               2394
3DFX Banshee (AGP)               2375
Nvidia Riva TNT (AGP)            1926
Matrox G200(AGP)                 1634
Nvidia Riva 128 (AGP)            1496
Intel i740 (AGP)                 1367
Rendition V2200                  1196
3Dlabs Permedia II (AGP)         1189
Nvidia Riva 128ZX (AGP)          1133
ATIRage Pro Turbo (AGP)          1060
Num. Nine Revolution IV (AGP)    1037
3DFX VooDoo 2                     972
Trident 3Dimage975                678
Cirrus GO5465                     472
S3 Trio3D(AGP)                    305

A few things I'd want to point out:
- Voodoo2 result is 972 ??? No way in hell. It should be around 2000. 
- S3 Savage3D HW was not a version that is publicly available yet.
- Riva128ZX gets worse results than Riva128? Impossible. It's the same card, 
they should've used same drivers, ZX just has more memory and clock speed.

I know and you know that 3DMark does not give these kind of results on 
Voodoo2 unless there is something VERY wrong with the test setup 
(hw/drivers/software running in background). There is something fishy 
going on...
