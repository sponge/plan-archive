24 May 1998

E3 rush is still on. Haven't gotten much sleep lately. Our plane
is leaving next Weds 7:10am meaning we have to be at the airport
at 6am latest. Might not be worth sleeping at all... Although I'm
looking forward to E3 very much, I'm not that fond about the 16 hours
in transit that it takes for us to get there.

Did the Max Payne video yesterday. It's definitely cool, a lot better 
than the first video we did two months back. Come and check it out
at the god booth.

Today was time to setup the demo machine. I really hate carrying a 
computer with me when I travel, but no can do if you want to ensure 
everything works. Fortunately there are plenty of us to carry the 
luggage :) The different standards are a pain for us europeans coming
to the US. You have different voltage and a different TV standard.

Try to find a NTSC digital video in Finland -- impossible. Try to find
a 110 volts --> 230 volts power converter that can do over 50W; custom
manufactured item only, three weeks delivery time. AARGH! Fortunately 
everything has now been arranged and there should not be any 
complications. Just have to hope the airline doesn't lose our bags :)

See you at E3!

Man I'm still phased out from today's long benchmark interface design
session. Long brainstorming sessions leave me completely drained.

It's almost E3-time. My g.o.d. it shows heavily over here :) (no 
blasphemy intended..) Unfortunately I'm not going, I've still to see
that show, but somebody needs to keep the shop running). Well, fortunately
E3 arrangements are not burdening me too much.

We sort of agreed yesterday that Joe Siegler would handle Max's to-be-
released new web site updates. That's good news for all of you Max Payne
fans as it means you will see updates there much more often than if it were
us doing it :)

Now with the emerging new 3D accelerators and AGP 2x, everybody's hyping 
that "it doesn't matter how much video memory the card has because 
textures can be transferred through AGP".

Yes, they can. Nobody just seems to realize the difference in bandwidth
between local video mem and AGP memory. If you have a P350+ with 100MHz 
frontside bus (64 bits), that's 800MBytes/s bandwith to memory. With the
"old" 66MHz bus that figure drops to 532MBytes/s. Compare these 
with e.g. RIVA 128's 1.6GBytes/s bandwith. There is a difference.

Did I tell you I hate Mondays? :)

If you read Petri's plan update for today, you heard about the e-mail
spoofing attack received by House of Payne. It's a relatively small 
issue, technically, but it has kept me busy for a few hours. If it 
wouldn't have been our own product in line I would have had fun 
tracking down the *sshole (who wasn't very clever btw).

Sending fake e-mail is so easy that it's not fun :) I wish everybody 
would update their mail server software so that it would not allow
outside people to use the server for relaying messages. We notified 
this (Bahrain-based) ISP our spoof went through that their systems 
are not "up to date" (nicely put) but there must be thousands of similar
systems anybody can use.

Well, I'll have my fun when this guy *burns* :) Sometimes I 
just love the digital world where you leave trails everywhere you go
(unless you're very very good).

23:40 and still at the office (since 9am) -- wanna be a game developer? 
Well, I do! Today's one of these "hey, let's just quickly do this AVI of
this realtime 3d piece" and 6 hours later... :)

And of course our coke machine is out of coke. DOH! Full service my a**.
They hyped they have a modern computer tracking system so they know to come
and fill it up before it runs out. Now they tell me their system crashed :)

We definitely need a "Joe Siegler" here at Remedy (hi there Joe :-). It 
would be nice if somebody would have time to update our web site once in a 
while. Which brings to mind, we'll have a new MP web site in "Alpha" now
(it's online whenever it's done) (later)...)

Did a checklist on installing Win95 today. 19 steps and approximately same 
amount of reboots. Yippee! No offense MS but Linux does the same in one
reboot. Well, I'll still take Win95 over Linux anyday for workstation use :)

More bitching :) I read the 3DS Max2 license agreement a while back
(had too much time I guess), and found out that you are not allowed to
sell that software onwards without permission from Kinetix (Autodesk. 
Called the Finnish retailer and they said "We haven't given those 
permissions". So you buy a  program and can't sell it if you don't
need it anymore. That's what I call a "good deal" ...NOT!

Three favorite games here at the office: BattleZone, Q2 & Starcraft.

Thanks for everybody who e-mailed me ideas for the next benchmark,
and sorry that I haven't been able to give you feedback earlier.
We've been having serious planning sessions for the last week and the 
concept is starting to take form.

First off, the benchmark will not be called "Final Reality 2" or '98. 
It's a completely new product. We've now "practised" once, and now we 
can do it better. Then, to the feedback.

Many of you wanted to have an OpenGL benchmark (about 25% of e-mails).
That's not going to be in on this one for a couple of reasons. We want
to committ to Direct3D at the time, and test one platform properly.
Second, there's only one OpenGL out at the time (Quake) and you can do
your OpenGL benchmarking with that pretty well. But don't worry, we will
not forget OpenGL, we just have to return to that subject later :-)

So, it's gonna be D3D (DX6), no bus tests like in FR, no 2D tests. 
Pure 3D. It's for Win95/98, and why not for NT5 Microsoft releases it in 
time (which I doubt). NT4 is a no-no because of DirectX. Don't blame us :)

Other requests:
 - It's gonna be gaming oriented & real world (again!)
 - I'm not promising DirectSound3D but we'll see...
 - Glide won't be there, at least not by default...
 - Don't worry, support for the new features of DX6 will be there (bump,
   texture compositing etc.)
 - Multiple resolutions / color depths? You got it!
 - We'll do our best to take the "demo" mode back to the "old school" 
   style and make it rock much more than FR.

We have lots of other stuff in mind as well but I don't want to reveal you
too much just yet - just so that the excitement keeps up, you understand :)

My favourite game for this week: BattleZone. Although it's a bit of a  
"stressy" game because you have to do too many things at once...
Still waiting for Jane's F15...

Got a coke vending machine here at the office yesterday. Rocks, although
drinks are not exactly free as in some game companies ;) Cheap though.

11 April 1998

Happy Easter, everyone.

We're just starting to have initial plans of  our next 3D benchmark - if 
anyone has any GOOD ideas what a 3D benchmark should have, and how we can
improve Final Reality (can be found from our web site at 
http://www.remedy-ent.com), e-mail me at markus@remedy.fi. Please put
the words BENCHMARK IDEAS to your subject line so I can filter them.

Then, sheesh! Yesterday I saw a music video of a German band, having a 
badly made shootout/hand to hand combat with an animated Lara Croft. 
What is the world coming to? Besides, the song sucked :)

Hmm.. I need to start doing these updates more often.

During the past month -- Remedy has announced a new sister company,
Futuremark Corporation at http://www.futuremarkcorp.com, focusing
on 3D Benchmarks, so we're continuing in the footsteps of Final
Reality. Should be interesting enough.

Two new people started yesterday. Aki Maatta started as a mapper for Max
and Mika Tammenkoski as a technology programmer. Two too good people.
It's getting busy around here :-)

Got Voodoo2's finally (a bit more than a week ago)! They rock. Don't 
take me wrong, the opinions below count still. But it's a good solid 
working package, with speed & image quality you want.

Most expected game for me is Jane's F-15. Finland's just lagging a week
behind in game availability. DOH!

Finally we seem to be on the winning side in this long battle against
the internet and ISP's. We've now under a new ISP, new Linux servers,
and everything seems to work fine. 

Also the finger service is back online - it just needs a bit of tweaking
still.

I've been following the 3D accelerator market very closely for the past
year and I'm getting huge laughs out of this 3Dfx Voodoo 2 - Creative -
Diamond issue that's been on the news. Now for some analysis and 
personal opinions:

Everybody talks about the "Voodoo 2" chip. It's actually three chips; two
TMU's and one frame buffer unit (+ a heck of a lot of memory chips). It
looks to me like a Voodoo design, doubled, and spiced up a bit (better
MHz, bump mapping, more polygon init stuff). To me making a product with
that many components is very expensive. Compare the solution to the ones
from Intel, NVIDIA, ATI, Rendition. All of them are one chip solutions AND
include 2D as well. 

The other side of the coin is memory. Voodoo 2 needs a lot of it and as a
game developer, I would hope that 8MB Voodoo2 boards would not have been
invented at all (too little texture memory). 12MB mem on a Voodoo 2 board
compares roughly to a 8MB RAM with a more sensible design from somebody
else. Plus, don't forget the AGP nonlocal video memory support. Where's
that on the Voodoo 2?

So others save two chips and 4MB memory - if they'd get to the same
level of performance. And they will. I believe this is the last generation
of cards when 3Dfx is in the lead.

Now, don't take me wrong, I actually haven't seen a Voodoo 2 board in
action yet and I'm sure when I get one I'll sing praises for it :-)

Next week --- My 2c on DirectX 6 and some analysis :-)

p.s. how much of your product is downloaded from the web in one day?
We had 17.8 GB worth of Final Reality downloads when version 1.01 was
released...
