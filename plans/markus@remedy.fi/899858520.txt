Plan:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
7 July 1998

Final Reality's "follower", 3DMark, has then now been officially
released. If someone's interested, the press release is at
http://www.futuremarkcorp.com.

It's gonna be cool.

Futuremark could also use a good full-time producer / graphics
"lead" with a vision what looks cool. Because I don't have enough
time to give. Or alternatively Remedy could use an Operations 
Manager so I could focus on producing... You can also check out
the other jobs from Futuremark's site. But you need to be GOOD :)

We're thinking of using MP3 file format in 3DMark.

If anyone knows a good, free (cheap?) & lighting fast MP3 player 
lib / source that is or can be ported easily to Win32 platform 
(Visual C++ 5.0), is possibly a DLL or lib, e-mail markus@remedy.fi!

More specifically we need:
- no actual "player" interface, no sound card interface etc....
- just something that would decode MP3.
- it would need to be able to seek to locations in the middle. 
- no encoder
- Uses max. 4% of CPU time on a P2-266 while playing a 128kbit stream.
- Good quality, preferably adjustable (->if more speed is needed).

What we can offer -- that's largely negotiable. Name in the credits and a 
*large* audience at least. All offers answered :) - so e-mail me!


Cheers,

Markus
