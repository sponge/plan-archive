In case anyone's interested, MadOnion.com's just released 
a new update to 3DMark2000. The new 1.1 version fixes issues
with for example Windows 2000 and detects new CPUs like Pentium 4
and Duron. Available at www.madonion.com.

Also, PC game developers, I recommend moving all of your programmers
to developing on Win2k as soon as possible. Remedy & MO is not
installing ANY Win9x computers anymore to people. Noticing 
some bugs that cause a crash is much easier on Win2k. We
do use for example boundschecker and other utils, but still
there were few probs that didn't appear on Win98, only on
Win2000. Ah well, just my two cents.

Last thing, I wanted to thank the Texans for their hospitality
during my holiday in Austin/Dallas last month, especially Terry,
Scott, Steven & Jason and everybody at 3DR & G.o.D. Made my life
a lot more fun especially since my ankle was sprained and made 
walking painful for a few days.
