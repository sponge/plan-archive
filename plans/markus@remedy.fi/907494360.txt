Plan:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
04 October 1998

It's time for some 3D Hardware driver awards, _based on our experiences_

Best install
Matrox (any driver, any hw). Very fast, very easy, haven't gotten 
install to screw up ever. Plus they have unified drivers for some
products. Quite an achievement of coordination on hw production &
software driver development.

Best reliability & functionality in shipped drivers
No award given. Everybody goofs up occasionally.

Best developer support (e-mail tech support)
3Dfx
NVidia  
Honorable mentions go also to 3D Labs & ATI

Best DirectX 6 drivers
NVidia. I guess their co-development with Microsoft paid off. 
Developing the DX6 support for Max-FX would have been nearly 
impossible without their good beta drivers.


Oh yeah, I guess my mad raving about the Hercules' drivers paid off
since S3 has now new reference drivers on their site that work 
nicely with both NFS3 and our technology, just 2 days after my 
last plan update. Coincidence? Maybe. Besides, the card rules.
It's about as fast as TNT on single texturing apps (on a P2-400),
but in multi-texturing apps TNT beats it by a big margin. Savage3D also
seems to have a better AGP implementation than TNT.

I'd need to benchmark the Savage3D on a slower system to get a complete
picture of it's performance & scalability.

But Savage3D is  TNT is  (Finnish wholesale prices). Hmmm...
Decide for yourself.

I'd still recommend that all Hercules BEAST users use the S3 reference 
drivers, not the ones from Hercules.
