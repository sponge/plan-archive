10 September 1998

ECTS98 is over. Look for a short ECTS report in our web pages in a few 
days. But the guys who came from there say it was a success...

Check out http://www.gamespot.co.uk for their Max Payne article.

Scott Miller came to visit us here in Finland for the first time. 
Although the weather isn't important, it's of course raining :)

Last, a bit of nagging to all 3D hw manufacturers. Get your act together
on DirectX 6 drivers.

If you're a dev support person in a 3D card company, and have DX6 drivers
for your hw (old or new), send 'em here (to markus@remedy.fi). 
I'll test them. Or if you're in 3DMark BETA program, we can test and debug
them together.

To my knowledge, the only public DX6 drivers are from Matrox (for G200).
And the ones that ship with TNT. This, frankly speaking, sucks.
