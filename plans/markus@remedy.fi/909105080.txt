14 October 1998

Sami, Kim and I have been working hard on 3DMark's demo mode. Haven't 
gotten much sleep. But this has been lots of fun.

A note on the Voodoo2 DirectX6 drivers. We've noted a quite large
speed increase (20+%) on multi-texturing apps (Max Payne & 3DMark's 
First Person game test). But it comes with a price.

For a DX6 3D engine writer the "odd" (or different) behaviour of Voodoo2
is a slight problem. The problem comes from the separate texture memories,
as you know Voodoo2 is the only current card that cares where in memory
the textures are placed if multi-texturing is used.

It means in practise that the programmer needs to know very early which 
TMU needs the material and that's not a very optimal case. It also means
that Voodoo2 dual TMU support requires special cases (and they are always
BAD).

This is probably why SHOGO had it disabled in the release, and enabling 
it is easy but causes some minor problems like that the textures might
needed to be allocated two times, once for each TMU... (Note, this was
one of the problems we faced, and Shogo might not have this problem)

Also remember that the free trilinear filtering ability is gone...
