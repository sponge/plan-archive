Couple of comments on 3DMark 99.

3DMark downloads exceeded 1 terabyte in just three days. Cool, eh?

Our results web pages at www.3dmark.com will be online early next week.
The system is nearly complete. We can already get data from SQL and 
print graphs to the screen. Now we just need to fine tune it a bit
and then we can start mass-producing different kinds of views of 
the data we have.

Why TNT doesn't seem to be able to do two texels / clock on single 
texturing fill rate? We don't know for sure. Current best guess is
that they can't do two (additive) alpha blends per clock but they
could draw two solid texels per clock. Or something.

The TNT seems to be quite driver dependant. Installed the .37 reference
drivers and my results dropped quite much. 

Oh yeah, those with a Banshee, yellow screen in 3D rendering is a 
feature. We don't know the reason but it happens sometimes with 
ALL 3D progs. Cool, eh?

The top score we've received so far is 4187 (in 640x480). It's done with
an SLI but how the heck much has that dude overclocked his Voodoo2's? My
SLI setup gave only 3681 on our fastest (OC'd to 500MHz) system.

Huge thanks go to the AGN3D guys for helping us with the downloads.
For the occasion, I bought a  unlimited traffic virtual web
server, but they e-mailed me after 8000 3DMark downloads that their 
server can't take it anymore :)

Well, 200 gigs for  - a good deal...

3DMark release is tomorrow. That is tomorrow US time. Not Finnish
time. Anyway, go to http://www.3dmark.com and download your own 
copy.

Phew. Everything seems to have clicked to it's proper place. But it's 
been a heck of a crunch.

Anyway, I hope you all like 3DMark and it's some value to you. I think
at least the demo mode should blow some of you away. It has some creative
uses for particles...
