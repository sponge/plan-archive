Finally we seem to be on the winning side in this long battle against
the internet and ISP's. We've now under a new ISP, new Linux servers,
and everything seems to work fine. 

Also the finger service is back online - it just needs a bit of tweaking
still.

I've been following the 3D accelerator market very closely for the past
year and I'm getting huge laughs out of this 3Dfx Voodoo 2 - Creative -
Diamond issue that's been on the news. Now for some analysis and 
personal opinions:

Everybody talks about the "Voodoo 2" chip. It's actually three chips; two
TMU's and one frame buffer unit (+ a heck of a lot of memory chips). It
looks to me like a Voodoo design, doubled, and spiced up a bit (better
MHz, bump mapping, more polygon init stuff). To me making a product with
that many components is very expensive. Compare the solution to the ones
from Intel, NVIDIA, ATI, Rendition. All of them are one chip solutions AND
include 2D as well. 

The other side of the coin is memory. Voodoo 2 needs a lot of it and as a
game developer, I would hope that 8MB Voodoo2 boards would not have been
invented at all (too little texture memory). 12MB mem on a Voodoo 2 board
compares roughly to a 8MB RAM with a more sensible design from somebody
else. Plus, don't forget the AGP nonlocal video memory support. Where's
that on the Voodoo 2?

So others save two chips and 4MB memory - if they'd get to the same
level of performance. And they will. I believe this is the last generation
of cards when 3Dfx is in the lead.

Now, don't take me wrong, I actually haven't seen a Voodoo 2 board in
action yet and I'm sure when I get one I'll sing praises for it :-)

Next week --- My 2c on DirectX 6 and some analysis :-)

p.s. how much of your product is downloaded from the web in one day?
We had 17.8 GB worth of Final Reality downloads when version 1.01 was
released...
