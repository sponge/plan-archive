Just got back from GDC. This was my first time there, but I think
it's the best place to learn about new 3D technologies and meet with
companies on that field. One cool thing was that it was mostly about PC
game development, so just right for me. I don't care for consoles that much.

Also it's a very good place for free beer every night if you're into that...

Most impressing real time 3D demo I saw at GDC was the Japanese garden /
butterfly demo that they showed at the X-BOX launch. It's a shame it can't
be downloaded from anywhere except as a poor quality Quicktime mov.

Future looks very bright for PC game developers. Hardware seems to be 
ahead of game content nowadays. Also X-BOX can get us poor Direct3D 
PC game developers a much wider distribution with hardly no platform 
conversion work. Sorry OpenGL people :-)

On the console notation - I didn't see much of anything about PS2 at GDC.
Only the Lithtech engine demo at their booth (*surprisingly* poor looking)
and the rumour that UT was running 10fps at Epic's booth. Didn't see it
myself.

Also met with a few Playstation2 developers, they saw our technology
running at the Intel hospitality suite, and asked two questions:
1) Is this real time?
2) Can you really do this on a PC?
