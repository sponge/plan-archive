Plan:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
21 July 1998

Just came from Petri's (Max Payne's producer) room. It was a difficult 
walk back to my room. Why? Because my head exploded. Kaboom! So cool stuff
I see seldom. And I'm not easy to impress.

My current favourite weapon in Max Payne is H&K MP-5. It rocks. Accurate
and fast.

I'm now officially appointed producer of 3DMark. More stress & work for 
me :-)

Also, if you didn't know, DX6 final is here, after a long wait! Get it from
www.microsoft.com/directx. And our engine supports DX6 already!

Then, for those who know about demo scene or have heard about "Future Crew"
-- if those words don't mean anything to you, nevermind the rest of the 
story... Anyway, one of the most important scene events, Assembly '98
(http://www.assembly.org) is next weekend, and inspired by that we got the
old Future Crew team together and started brainstorming... We got a bunch
of cool effects on paper and we'll see what happens. If nothing else, you
might see some of those effects in 3DMark.

Finally, I'm sorry that I don't have a digital camera. If I did, I could
take a picture of Darth Vader observing us from top of our coke machine :)
