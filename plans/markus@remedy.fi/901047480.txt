Plan:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
21 July 1998

The great Remedy logo censorship is complete. All the logos 
on our web site have been changed. I think this is ridiculous, as 
Scott Miller said, "may the Farce be with you". For more info on
the matter, read the press release on our pages, http://www.remedy.fi,
and Scott's plan file.

I've already started to build my own lightsaber so I can complete
my Jedi skills, to defend the world from the Dark Side.

Thanks for everybody who have sent me info on MP3 players.
We haven't found a perfect solution yet, but on the other hand
we've been occupied on other fronts. So far http://www.freeamp.com
sounds most promising, all things considered.

Oh yeah, www.remedy-ent.com is offline for now, the ISP has some minor
probs. Use www.remedy.fi instead, but don't clog us up completely :-)

That's all folks!
