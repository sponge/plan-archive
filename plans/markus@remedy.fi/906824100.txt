26 September 1998

This is my personal opinion, and that only. And yes, I'm pissed.

I finally got my hands on the first S3 Savage3D board yesterday. I have 
never ever_ seen such crappy *RELEASED* hardware & driver than the Hercules
Terminator BEAST with S3 Savage3D.

Let me tell you the full story.

Remedy registered as a S3 developer at E3. We were promised a board in a 
month :) That's ok that we didn't get one then as delays are common in
this line of business. 

At ECTS Futuremark (Remedy's subsidiary) requested a board from S3 
to do compatibility testing for 3DMark as we had heard it crashes currently
and S3 engineers had no clue why (it currently looks like their DX6 driver 
gives an unsupported error message). S3 couldn't supply us with a board at 
all, and told us to "go to the states and buy one". Yeah right... Pretty 
cool attitude especially when Futuremark is making a 3D benchmark with 
projected distribution of many million copies.

Ok, as I said we finally got one from the Hercules' Finnish distributor.
Cool. They even waited for us half an hour after closing time so we could
get the board ASAP and it only cost about  + tax.

Got back to the office, plugged the board in to our P2-400 demo/test 
system, downloaded newest drivers from Hercules' site, installed 'em
and we had a picture. Cool. Did some testing. NFS3 demo (DirectX 5) had 
some (a lot actually) flickering polys, treetops looked like the texture
had an offset of a few pixels, but it was fast and otherwise ok. Our own
DX5 engine stuff worked about as fine as well. Our DX6 stuff did not work
at all as assumed, couldn't even get past init (works fine on V2, TNT, 
Matrox, i740, RagePro, Permedia2,... well, you get my point).

Ok. Gave the card to our 3D Engine / Direct3D expert guy, Jussi. Installed
it to his P2-266 (Win95), same way as we did for the previous computer.

Reboot and KABOOM. No signal to the screen. Use the magical three keys;
Ctrl-alt-del. Booting ... Operating System Not Found! Nice. Whole FAT was
corrupted on the C drive. Don't know if it was the reason of the BEAST or 
just a weird coincidence (don't believe those at all mind you)...

Anyway, new hard disk in (as the old was getting small anyway), install Win98
with the Savage3D in the machine, install display drivers, reboot. 

DOH! No signal AGAIN! Note that I had a monitor that could do 1600x1200 
75Hz... Reboot.

"Your Display Adapter is Configured Incorrectly. Please click OK to start the 
hardware troubleshooter". FUCK. Ok, configured it again as I have done a 
million times before with other adapters, and rebooted. Kaboom, no signal!

Fought with it for a while before giving up and plugging the TNT back in.
Man I love the Nvidia drivers. (And this is not a shameless plug!)

Don't know who to hate more, S3 Savage3D chip or Hercules' drivers. Probably
the drivers. I have some seriously bad history with Thriller3D & Stingray
drivers as well. *I* would not release a product that is that unfinished.

The chip & the card itself could be ok on long term (when it's _tested_) but
now... phew!

ECTS98 is over. Look for a short ECTS report in our web pages in a few 
days. But the guys who came from there say it was a success...

Check out http://www.gamespot.co.uk for their Max Payne article.

Scott Miller came to visit us here in Finland for the first time. 
Although the weather isn't important, it's of course raining :)

Last, a bit of nagging to all 3D hw manufacturers. Get your act together
on DirectX 6 drivers.

If you're a dev support person in a 3D card company, and have DX6 drivers
for your hw (old or new), send 'em here (to markus@remedy.fi). 
I'll test them. Or if you're in 3DMark BETA program, we can test and debug
them together.

to my knowledge, the only public DX6 drivers are from Matrox (for G200).
And the ones that ship with TNT. This, frankly speaking, sucks.
