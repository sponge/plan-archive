QBS2 - July 11th...<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<br>
<b>26th June 1998</b><br>
<br>
Looking at the countdown on the QBS page I see that I only have 14 days and 23 hours left until QBS2 must be<br>
complete and in the final preparations for upload.<br>
<br>
I think it's hitting home just how much has to be done to make this target and how many things I want to have<br>
ready for the 2.0 release.<br>
<br>
Tonight I added a feature that I suddenly thought would be a good idea - emailing pages and plan maintainers straight<br>
from the lists. Right click - "Send Email to Redwoods 3D News..." or whatever and thats it, email client launched and ready<br>
to go. Right click "Send Email to John Carmack..." - that works too. Now I just have to add the email addresses of all the<br>
news pages and its done.<br>
<br>
I've also got the options section to finish - a slobbering beast of a section where you control everything about the program.<br>
Want Customised sounds? Don't want it to make a sound? Don't want it to flash the tray icon? Want to hear different<br>
sounds depending on who has updated? All possible.<br>
<br>
Want to see red icons that work? Want it to automatically tell you about new versions and upgrade to them? New graphics?<br>
New web site? Registration when you run it for the first time? Stats on the pages you visit? A smart app which can do things<br>
for you? Such as noticing that you goto Blue everytime he updates and then asking if you want this to happen automatically...<br>
<br>
A new download component that works on more machines? A new way for launching pages and browsers for those of you who<br>
it still doesn't work for?<br>
<br>
News headlines from a variety of sources? Entertainment? Faster? Help files? Proper error messages? ZIP file support for faster<br>
updates?<br>
<br>
The list goes on... and on... and on...<br>
<br>
and the timer goes down.... and down.... and down... July 11th is coming...<br>
<br>
