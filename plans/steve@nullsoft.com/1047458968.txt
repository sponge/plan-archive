Plan:
March 11, 2003 - 11:55PM

I'm going to LA on Friday. I'm not particularly excited about
it. I generally hate going to LA at this point. I guess it'll
be nice to hang out with friends and what not. I just don't
know if having to put up with the shit that comes along with
travel is worth it. Whatever.

So the cats out of the bag, so to speak. Justin mentioned a
bunch of shit that's going on around the Winamp player. There
are many good things that are going to be coming in the next
year or so.

At this point, I just wanted to say something. Yes, we're not
dumb. We hear what users have to say about Winamp3. We know
where we must improve. We have the will and the focus to now
do so.

For those of you who are frustrated with Winamp3, all I can
say is remain patient because good things do really come to
those who wait.

I would love to get into much more detail about all this shit, 
but unfortunately, at this moment, I really can't. Over the next
couple of weeks and months, you'll definitely get a much clearer
understanding of what we're up to and where we are going.

Before I go, I just want you all to know that I'm baking a hot
steaming loaf, just for you, and damn does it smell tastey.
