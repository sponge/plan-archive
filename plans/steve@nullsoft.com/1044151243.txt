So yesterday might be a big day for us. Kind
of hard to explain. Just seems like things are
different. Like I'm happy again. Excited about
what I spend my time on. It's good.

I bought this new video card for my mac. It's
the ATI Radeon 9000. Too bad I can't use it 
because I stupidly bought a card that had only
a DVI and ADC port on it. I ended up letting 
Tom use that while I use his old Geforce 4 MX.

Sharon and I are learning Armenian. We bought
this book, an old one at that, which guides 
you step by step to learn Armenian. I'm really
excited. My Armenian has been pretty weak most
of my life anyway, nows my chance to really
improve it.

Oh yeah, I heard that I have a stalker or
something. Well, he's more of a stalker of the
entire crew, not just me. I've never had one
of those before, seems kind of interesting to
have one. Maybe I'll receive a threat letter or
something in the mail soon.

Why are there no decent IRC clients for the Mac?
I mean, jesus, it's not like we're talking about
Microsoft Office. No one knows how to code. The
only decent one I've played with is SNAK, but
that's just barely decent. Lame.

Going on a hike tomorrow. I'm excited. I hope
that Biderman doesn't decide to flake on this
whole trip. It'll be a lot of fun, I haven't
gone hiking in a long long while.

Okay, I'm done. Bye.
