Holy crap. This weekend was pretty nuts, to say
the least. I went camping up in Big Basin. Dave,
Erin, Sharon, and I all went hiking and enjoyed 
the wilderness for all it's worth.

We went hiking and saw some really increddible 
things. There are many pictures that were taken,
if you'd like to see some, <a href="http://genghis.winamp.com/~steve/archive/index.phtml?path=trips%2FBig%20Basin%20-%2006-09-2001" target="_blank">click here</a>...

This past week has been really strange. I can't 
exactly say as to why, just yet... It's probably
because I'd get in to trouble with someone if I 
do say something without spilling the beans to
the person first. Regardless, I'm happy the way 
everything has gone and there is much happiness
in my life at the moment.

I'm going to be going to LA in a few weeks. I don't
know if I'm happy or sad about it really. It's been
kinda nice not being there for such long periods of 
time, however, I did promise Sako that I'd go to his
Sis's wedding and I've also made some other plans
around it all.. I'm sure it will be fun no matter
what ends up happening.

I'll be going to Las Vegas at the end of the month
for a few days. That should definately prove to be 
quite exciting. The weather will be wonderful, my
friends will have finsihed school and I'll be 
having the time of my life. I hope.

I want to say hi to Taline and thank her for not 
letting me feel like a loser at the upcoming
wedding. 

That's it for now kids, see you all later...
