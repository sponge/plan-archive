Okay, so I hate LA. Really really bad. I'm here again. 
We laid my grandma to rest yesterday afternoon and I'm
gonna be here till Monday morning dealing with family 
shit. I really don't wanna be here anymore. First off,
it's incredibly boring. There's absolutely nothing to
fucking do here.

I'm gonna try to head down to San Diego over the 
weekend to see Justin's house. I've been meaning to 
head down there but I never seem to have any time when
I'm in LA to do anything unless it's at night. I think
I might have to just take a special trip straight to
SD to make something like that happen if I can't pull 
it off during this trip.

I miss Sharon. So much. You know, it's nice waking up
next to a warm body every morning. I'll be back soon
enough.
