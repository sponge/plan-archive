I was going to talk about a specific subject,
but now, after thinking about it some more,
I decided that it's probably not a good idea
cause of one reason or another. 

Anyway, on to another subject I guess....
Today, I went to the beach with Sharon. We 
had a great time. We went down to go buy a
frisbee and watch a movie and then go to the
beach, but little did we realize that we both
had forgotten to bring our wallets. What a 
bunch of schmucks we are. So we scrounged up
all the change that was available in Sharon's 
car and came up with $10. Quite a lot for 
just being change that has accumliated in the
back seat of someone's car... 

So we took the ten bucks and headed to the 
toy store on the main drag and bought us a 
original classic frisbee. The cashier was not
happy to see the fact that we had brought him
nothing more than quarters, nickels, and dimes.
After we spent a short 5 minutes counting up
right ammount of change, we headed to the
thai restaurant across the street and got
ourselves some watered down shitty thai iced-
teas. We got to sit around and act like
a couple of speds though, so that was kinda
fun. 

After that, seeing that we had pretty much
spent all the money we had, we went down to 
the beach and played frisbee for a 3 hours or
so. THAT was a lot of fun. I hadn't played
frisbee in years. While we were playing, we 
made a new friend named Thomas, he's from 
Sac-town... He and his homies had driven down
to watch the fireworks. Good for them I say.
Swell lad.

After that was all said and done, we decided
to just head home. When we got there we made 
rad ass Tuna-Melt. That was good stuff. Okay,
Sharon is starting to hum the Doogie Houser
theme, I think it's off to bed for me. Good
night my friends.
