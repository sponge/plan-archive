Plan:
March 2, 2003 - 11:57PM

Woo, Sharon's in the shower. I better do this quick
before she gets out and I have to go in. Man, I smell.

Sharon and I went down to Santa Cruz today, we met up
with Rob at his house and went bike riding. We ate
sandwiches by the light house and then we moved on to 
eating a very filling dinner at the Crow's Nest in 
Aptos. 

We stayed for comedy night. It was actually really 
entertaining. The first comedian, Sandy Sticks wasn't
all that great. She spent her time up their to poke
fun at herself. She had a few funny ones, but basically
she ended up walking off stage with more people releaved
than laughing.

The other guy, Bengt Washburn was HILARIOUS. We laughed
for about 2 hours straight. He was totally worth the
time. All in all a fantastic day. I loved it.

Okay, time go get off this blasted thing. God I can't 
wait for the new hard drive for this piece of shit 
computer. It's so fucking loud right now I can't even
think.
