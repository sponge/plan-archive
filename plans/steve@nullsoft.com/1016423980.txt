This update won't be nearly as long as the 
last. So I was up last night, up till about
5:00AM working. Actually, I was working for 
most of it, the rest of the time I was off
chatting with pals in #nullsoft. I realized
that it was fucking COLD in my house and I
drove to my gurl friends house so that I 
could cuddle up in the bed with her, damn
that was a great fucking idea. :)

We got a dog, she's adorable. She's a pitbull
and something mix, we don't know what yet.
She was found roaming the streets, appearing
to be an abandoned dog. Someone took her in 
and then had to give her up so we came into
the picture and now this dog is recieving
some insane amounts of love. I think the dog
thinks it landed a total jackpot.

It's been really cold outside this weekend.
California is a little ridiculous in that
way, one moment it's completely sunshine,
the next it's raining like there's no 
tomorrow, i haven't quite figured out why it's
so fucked but I think you learn to appreciate
it.

I'm anxiously awaiting the arrival of
Blizzard's latest and greatest, Warcraft III.
I'll probably go buy it the day it comes out
I recommend you all do aswell if you know 
what's good for you.

Winamp3 is coming along very very nicely. I'm
still using Winamp3 and Winamp 2 at the same
time but it's getting damn close to the point
where I won't even have Winamp2 installed
anymore.

Time to go get the laundry, be back later.
