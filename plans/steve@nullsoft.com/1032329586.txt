Sharon's about to go to bed and I'm just sitting here
getting my laptop up to date with all the "latest"
versions of my documents. I'm going to be going to 
Mountain View tomorrow to work from there. There's
some all hands meeting or something on campus and I'd
like to be there for it.

I gotta wake up early as fuck to make it there, which
won't be fun, but whatever, I'm going. Tuesdays and
Thursdays are proving to be very hectic. I'm basically
walking through the front door, walking into meetings
all day. I don't even have time to go to lunch with my
friends. It totally bites balls. I wonder how much 
more of this I can really take?

David stuck me with the bill on so much shit this week,
it's kinda funny. That jerk. I'm waiting for him to 
come back eagerly so my life can get a little back in 
order, or something like that. 

oops, sharon's out. time for bed.
