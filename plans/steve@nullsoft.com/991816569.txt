Interesting... Winamp 2.76 now finally has a
damn shuffle logic that works... AFTER ALL
THIS TIME, and guess what, I don't use the 
fucking thing anymore. I use Winamp3 now,
100% of the time and WA3 doesn't even seem to
have a shuffle in place. DAMN IT. I can never
seem to win.

I spent most of the evening playing the game
called Alice. It's really intense. I get
wrapped in it.. I can't even think. It's just
this whole world. Very well done I must say.

Okay, I'm done. I'm going to bed now. Good
Night...
