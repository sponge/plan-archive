Wow, Sharon is a total freak. I love her so 
much it scares me sometimes. She is just so 
amazing. The way she thinks, talks, laughs,
walks. Everything. She puts a smile on my
face every morning. Every night, I go to bed
happy knowing she's there with me. She's 
the best.

It's a little weird. When do you know that 
you've found a person that you can literally
spend the rest of your life with? It's been
about a year and a month since we started
dating and it's still going strong. I find
myself aching to see her every day. We have
yet to find something honestly upsetting to 
argue about. Maybe this one's just meant to 
last. I'm happy with that. I've got NO
complaints.

I see that Sharon does worry about me at times.
I don't want her to worry about me. I can 
completey understand her concerns, I just don't
think that there's cause for alarm. I'm fine
most of the time and when I'm not it's pretty
blatantly obvious. She knows that though. I
love her.

She's my hero.

Good night.
