April 23, 2003 - 12:34AM

Hot damn it's good to be back. I actually got back on
the 20th. I've been using the time to recover from the
week of lots of scuba diving and drinking (not at the 
same time, of course :).

I'm going to get the pictures up soon. Many of which 
came out phenomenal, I might add. Digital cameras
totally rock. Thanks for the emails from you people with
the links to the underwater digital equipment. I'm
defintely going to investigate further when I have
some more cash on hand.

My girlfriend is pretty. Especially when she cuttles 
right up to me and starts to fall asleep. I love that.
I get a big smile when I look at her. So peaceful. So
happy. Everyday, I'm happier than the previous because
I know that I have her in my life. Yeah yeah, all you
boys and girls who are single right now are about to 
barf, I'm sure. But hey, it's just my turn to be lucky
on this front, so cut me some slack ;)

Okay, well it's time for bed. I shall check back in 
soon I'm sure.

Good times
