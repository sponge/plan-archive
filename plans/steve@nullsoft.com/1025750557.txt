Now that I'm back, just when I think that my life
is finally getting back to normal, it's not. it's 
doing just the opposite in fact. People are weird,
you know... Sometimes you wonder what they someone
is thinking when they do something, but you can't 
ever know.

I'm a little bummed about something that I'm not
going to say anything when I've confirmed that 
there is indeed something to be bummed about first.

I'll get back to you as soon as I know...
