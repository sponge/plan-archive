Oh my god. David Lynch is fucked up.
Tonight, Sharon and I decided that we'd
make dinner for everyone and rent a movie
to watch. So we got meat and chicken and
a bunch of veggies and made sheish kebabs
for everyone. The movie we rented, 
Mullholand Drive.

This movie is fuckin' fucked up. I'm not 
just saying it cause I like the word
fuck either. The entire movie pretty much
follows one plot line and within the last
few minutes of the movie, the entire plot
line changes to something entirely
different and knocks you on your ass. 

After the movie ended, I *think* that I
was totally pissed. I'm not entirely sure
what I think yet, however, I am pretty 
sure that I'm pissed about it. Don't get
me wrong, I think the movie was a total 
trip and for most of it, I was held in 
complete and utter suspense. However,
after 2 hours and 29 minutes of twists
and turns, I would have appreciated some 
sort of ending that would have given me
some closure.

I'm not sure if I'm going to recommend
this movie to anyone quite yet. I think
I may have to watch it once more before
I can really decide what I think about
it. 

I love Sharon. SO much. The more time that
goes by, the more I realize how much of a 
great match that she is for me. We're 
laying next to each other right now
updating our respective journals. How cute,
a geek and his blog with a girlfriend and
her journal. Makes you want to just cry.
Maybe not.

Speaking of blogs, bonnie burton freaks
me out sometimes. Her doggie bloggie is 
a little *too* weird for me. Check it
out on grrl.com if you want, but don't
say I didn't warn you.
