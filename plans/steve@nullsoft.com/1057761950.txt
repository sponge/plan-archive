Plan:
June 17, 2003 - 10:58PM

Things here have been crazy. It's an emotional
rollercoaster nearly every day. One day you're 
high on hope, next day you're feeling like it's
all about to fall apart. 

I'd like to write a book one day. It would likely
detail this portion of my life. I'd say it'd
probably cover between 1998 and 2004. I'd imagine
it would start out about how it was like growing
up Armenian, in LA, and then go through my high
school experiences and how retarded I was. Then
it would probably touch on getting involved with
Nullsoft and how it all just came out of the blue
and then likely the 4 years that followed.

I would probably never want to publish it. It's
more for me, just so I can always remember what
this part of my life was like.

Uh-oh, laundry is done, gotta take care of that.

I'll be back soon.
