Do things that people tell me I can't do.

<span style="font-size:small;">I forbid anyone from quoting my .plan for use in anything without
my written concent. Please. For the love of God. Do not quote me.

I maintain this .plan as a collection of my PERSONAL thoughts. They

I work with. Now... Get on with it.</span>


Plan:
May 2, 2003 - 12:14AM

Ever since I got back from Catalina, I haven't been
able to write in my .plan as often as I wanted. I had
a total groove going and going on vacation fucked it
up.

These past couple of weeks have been incredibly busy.
There's just a lot of projects related to Winamp all
going on at the same time. It's tough to keep track
of. Fortunately, we got ourselves a new Project
Manager, and ever since she came "onboard" things have
been SOOO much better for me. I am finally able to
step back a little and let someone else worry about
how things are going on with each project on a day
to day basis.

Anyway, I gotta go to bed... Talk to you soon...
