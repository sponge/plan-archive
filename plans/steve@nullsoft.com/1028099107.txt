Wow, I woulda never thought I'd see the day.
The end is finally near. Years of work, love,
and dedication is finally paying off. We're 
almost at the point where the whole world
will be able to use Winamp3 and love it for
what it is and what it does.

Don't ask me when it's coming out. I can't
really say, but it's damn near, that's fo'
damn sure. Am I proud of what we've managed
to accomplish? You're god damn right I am.

I think there are going to be a lot of people
who won't upgrade at first. It will take time.
Over the next few years, we're going to add
more and more reasons for people to use this
over anything else they can think of. 

I was talking to Brennan yesterday and it's
just kinda funny. It was just about 3 years
ago that we embarked on this project. Now, 
we're 3 years smarter, more mature, and 
definately more weathered. But despite all
the changes, the hardships, and the nuicenses
I am so fucking happy to work here. I love
everyone I work with, I love the projects we
work on, and I love the environment in which
it all happens.

The hard work that was put into Winamp3 shows
with everything you do with it. It's a great
player and an even better platform to build
atop of. This is just the begining for us and
our community. I'm almost willing to dare and
say that Winamp3 is as significant to us as
Windows 95 was to Microsoft. Our real work
only begins now.

Stay tuned for more.
