What the fuck. It's been well over a month
since I last updated. What the fuck is my
problem. It's called laziness. But what can
you do.

So, my loyal readers, whats new you don't
ask? Nothing. Nothing has really changed.
Basically, on a techinical front, we 
released a beta release of Winamp3 which 
has been pretty well recieived by the public
at-large. I'm actually really annoyed that
Brennan put me as the bug contact for WA3 
cause now everyone and their mothers are 
emailing me to tell me know that it's a
beta and that shit is broken. Whoopdy shit,
don't you think we know that shit's all
broken. If you really want it fixed, you 
should probably check it into bugzilla 
anyway.

Sharon has been great. Actually, she's been
spectacular. We've been together for almost
5 months now and I must say, I haven't been
happier, at least on that front. She's such
a freak sometimes, but it's good for me,
keeps me on my toes. Makes me realize how
big of a freak I am as well. Love does that
kinda shit, don't it.

Dave and Erin, my roommates, well now ex-
roommates just moved out to Santa Cruz, I 
wish them luck. The house hasn't been the
same since they left.

Rob is moving in, that excites me. I like
Rob, he's an odd fellow, however, he's all
good in all respects of the word.

Anyway, it's kinda late and I should head
off to bed. Good night.
