Plan:
March 26, 2003 - 8:45PM

Okay, so maybe I'm over reacting. I was just
thinking about the shit that put me off
tonight while I was flossing my teeth and I
realized something.

All the shit about my mom that I hate I'm
doing here. I'm nitpicking and nagging until
I get what I want and it's only putting the 
people I work with into a position where they
want to push me away. Ugh. This sucks. How 
did I let that happen.

I think a lot of my frustration comes from 
presure from expectations of me. I didn't ask
to become a product manager. It was pretty 
much dropped on my lap. Now, people expect me
to do all this bullshit to get the job done,
but no one realizes that the people I have to
work with to get that job done don't want to 
workin that way. 

Working with these expectations of me  makes 
it impossible to "plan" for the future. These
guys are incredibly smart, but they're also 
very picky about what they want to do. 

Anyway, I'll figure something out. I have to
or I'm just going to quit. The way things are
currently is unbareable.
