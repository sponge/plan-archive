December 9, 2001 - 2:01AM

I went to prom tonight. Well, not literally
prom, but for the most part. Sharon's friend,
Mitch, decided that it would be a great idea
to throw a prom in honor of all those who
have had bad prom experiences in the past.
So naturally, this prom was designed not to 
suck. The verdict is, it didn't suck. 

It was actually quite a bit of fun. We were
served a beautiful appetizer, a filling
dinner and a wonderful dessert. We hung out
among friends and had a shitload of laughs.
Basically, it was a lot of fun.

Now, Sharon and I are sitting on the couch
and she's patiently awaiting for me to 
finsih this .plan update. and so it is done.

Farewell and good night.
