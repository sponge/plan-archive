Well, I wanted to wish you all a very Happy
New Year. I'm sure everyone is excited this 
holiday season is over with. The concensus 
was that it was pretty uneventful. Everyone
did their own little thing and ended up 
not doing anything really amazing after the
New Year wrang in.

So now that that's all done and over with.
I wanted to greet you all with a new skin
that a few of us made for Winamp3. We hope
that you enjoy it. You can find it at this

Anyway, I'm really tired and almost feel 
hung over, even though I had nothing to drink
last night. I'll be back later.
