Plan:
March 13, 2003 - 12:01PM

This fucking country is going down in flames. Someone,
please help us. Bush is a lunatic. The Republicans are
out of control. I'm amazed at how little regard Bush 
has for the citizens of this country and the countless
other countries who are opposing this administration.

With the countless protests, the strict stance against
a possible war in Iraq, and the world wide outcry for 
peace, none of it makes a lick of difference to this 
administration. Bush and his drones are nothing more
war mongers of the worst kind. It's amazing the history
being made. The first president to not be elected, but
appointed by the Supreme Court, than undoes so much of 
the enviornmental good, fucks the economy, demands war,
begins to overturn abortion, and then tries to sweep
under the rug all the forward movement made since the
creation of the UN. This maniac tries to downplay North
Korea when they pose a threat much larger than Iraq 
could possibly ever pose.

Bush is NOT MY PRESIDENT. I look forward to him stepping
down at the next presidential election.
