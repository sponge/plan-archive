Holy jumping fuck nuts. I just finished 
Warcraft III and I'm fucking tired. Those
fucking bastards at Blizzard. Why'd they
have to make such a rad fucking game. I
mean come on, seriously. My poor girlfriend
probably thought there was something really
wrong with me or something cause I've been
just obscessed by the damn thing. Well, it's
now over. I finished. 

What about Battle.net you ask? Well, I've 
never really been a fan of bnet. I just hate
playing against people better than I. 
Frankly, I don't appreciate the idea of a
bunch of 14 year olds trying to rub in my 
face the fact that they have less of a life
than I cause they can beat me. 

God help me. I'm sorta looking forward, but
not really, to have my mom come out. I've
been doing the tourist thing quite a lot
lately and frankly, I'm a little sick of it.
I just want to veg out a little bit, is that 
to much to ask?

I love my girlfriend. Everything about her
is just amazing. Her sense of humor, her 
witty remarks, her perty smile. She brings
a smile to my face everytime I set my eyes
upon her, that's just precious, isn't it?

Okay, well, I'll go watch some TV now. Be
back later.
