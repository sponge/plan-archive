Oh jesus. My friend Luke sent Tom a copy of a commercial
today from Nokia. Holy shit, it was of this cat that 
grabs onto this little ball hanging from the blade of a
ceiling fan. The cat flys around the room a few times 
and eventually crashes into the corner of the room. 

Fucking HILARIOUS. It reminded me of this other video
that is just as hilarious, if not funnier. It's located
here:

Made me fucking laugh for about 20 minutes. I just kept
it on repeat, just watching it over and over again. So
good.

I had forgotten how good Quake3Arena was. We started all
playing it again at work. It's a wonderfully fun game.
It's especially fun since we're all at about the same 
skill level so the games end up being challenging and 
really fun. It's a good time.

Man, Winamp 2.9 is hot. SUPER hot. The Media Library 
simply put owns. It'll evolve over time and become even
more intuitive, but at this point, it's blazing fast and
very very usable. It works great. You're all in for a real
treat.

If you haven't checked out muse.net yet, I suggest you
go try it. It's Rob and Ian's new baby. It's pretty
good.

By the way, thanks to the courtesy of Patrick Cosson, our
former Marketing dude, we got our hands on one of these
new Slim Devices... (http://www.slimdevices.com). It's 
pricetag is a little bit high, but man does this thing
rock.

Anyway, I'm off.
