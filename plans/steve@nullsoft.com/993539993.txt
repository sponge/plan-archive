So here I am, sitting in LA with it almost
too hot to breath. I'm in Rupen's house and
I'm by myself. He went out to run "some 
errands" or some shit. I don't know where
the hell he went, but whatever. I uploaded
a shit load of pictures from this weekend. 
I love my digital camera, Canon makes some
great hardware.

On Thursday, we took a few hours in the 
afternoon to go rock climbing in a climbing
gym. It was a lot of fun. I think we're
going to end up doing it more often. It's
a great team building stuffs and it's just
damn fun to do.

I got distracted from this, now I'm going to
bed. I'll update this again, really soon,
I promise.
