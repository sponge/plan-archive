Doh! Grandma went off to a better place this 
morning. Her health's been failing for quite
some time now, so it wasn't a surprise or 
anything, but it still sucks. Too bad I didn't
even get a chance to say good bye or anything.

I'm heading to LA on monday or tuesday for the
funeral. I think I'll probably get back 
sometime the following week, I'm expecting on
monday or something. I don't know tho. Good
thing my schedule is such that it isn't going 
to be to detremental to anything.

Shucks, death sucks.
