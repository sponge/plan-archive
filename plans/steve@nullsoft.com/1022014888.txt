Today's quote of the day...

<em><pre><CraigF></pre> germ is gay</em>

I'm not sure if it's true or not but might
as well just throw it out there as a topic
of discussion.

So I'm in LA. Everytime I come back here I
realzie why I dislike this place so much.
At the moment, I really dislike the fact
that there's just nothing to do here. All
you can do for fun is basically go and be
with your friends in a restaurant or 
something. Last night, I went and hung out
at a Denny's with Koko and Edward. We just 
sat around and shot the shit. That's what
I call a "blast" in LA.

I'm anxious to get this E3 business over
with already. I'm sitting here on my ass
trying to focus on work but this place is
sucking my will to live.

Just four more days and you can be back at
home. FOUR MORE DAYS. STAY CALM EVERYONE.
