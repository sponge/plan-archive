Man, this whole career thing is a lot of pressure.
I mean lately has just been really hard. There
doesn't seem to be any relief in sight either.
What the hell. Not good times. 

Hmm, I wonder when sharon is getting home. It's 
nearly midnight. I look forward to going to bed.
I love waking up in the morning with my love next
to me. It's so relaxing. We just fit like two 
puzzle pieces into one another. It's a pretty 
amazing feeling.

I finally finished the game "Alice" tonight. It's 
dimented. A great game to say the least. I love the
atmosphere it creates. It's kinda like '7th Guest'
and Quake mixed ;)

On a sad note, it sounds as though the Hollywood
Star Lanes is closing down for good. I'm trying 
to find out when so that I can go and bowl one
last time before the place is torn down. The Los
Angeles Unified School District basically forced
them out so they can build an elementary. That's 
just totally bullshit if you ask me. I'd never
want to send my kid to a school in that area. It's
just dangerous and run down. It was however, a 
relavively brilliant location for that alley. It 
makes me sad.

I've been practicing playing the guitar lately,
with Sharon's help of course. It's hard stuff. My
fingers are having difficulty jumping from note 
to note. Also, I can't get comfortable with 
strumming. I guess I'll get the hang of it event-
ually, either that or quit. We'll see which one
comes first. ;)

Okay, anyway, I'm off. Later boys and girls.

By the way, iTunes fucking rocks.
