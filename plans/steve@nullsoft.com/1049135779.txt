March 31, 2003 - 9:47AM

I enjoy when people feel compelled to email me and 
tell me they disagree with what I have to say. It's
amazing that the things I write even matter to
people, as if I'm some authority on any of these
matters. 

Anyway, on to something else. Something a little
less controversal. I am the proud owner of a Treo 90
from Handspring. Unfortunately, the backlight on the
LCD display went out on the device, and Handspring
graciously replaced it. Now, I got the replacement,
and after not being even a month old, the stylus 
holder refuses to hold it in place. Handspring again
is sending me out another unit. I love their service
but am a little concerned about what's going to
happen when I get my device and my warantee runs out
in July.

Anyone else been seeing these kinds of issues with
their Treo's out there? Or is it just bad luck?

Anyway, I'm out. I've got a lot of work to do today.
