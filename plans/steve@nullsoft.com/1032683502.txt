September 22, 2002 - 12:40AM

Wow, what a hectic fucking month I've had. It's
literally been one thing after the next. So we 
had these pretty big meetings with one of the 
men upstairs. He's basically my boss's boss's
boss, and meeting with him initially was one
of the most nerve racking things I've had to 
deal with.

However, after meeting with him twice, I realized
that he's actually a really cool guy. He's a 
smart guy, forward thinking, and the thing that
really made my day is that he LOVES Winamp. It 
was great to hear the kinds of things that he
had to say about what we were up to and what we
wanted to do with our product. 

Regardless, the time for headaches are now gone,
temporarily. I'm really looking forward to
getting back to my every day life. Which is great,
but I do know I need a vacation super bad.

Anyway, things are really great, I'm happy, and 
best of all, work fucking rocks.

Be back later.
