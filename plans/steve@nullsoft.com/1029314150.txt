Bah. I'm stressed the fuck out out. I need to
take a fucking vacation way soon or I'm going
to literally lose it. I think that when Sharon
is near, she provides some sense of sanity or
calm within my life that I don't have other-
wise. She's been gone for two night now, she 
went camping. I've been stressing out from
work and not having her to cuddle with at
night is something that gets harder and harder
with every passing day. Don't get me wrong,
I'm actually really happy that she went. Shit,
I wish that I had gone with her, damn knows I
coulda used the time off. However, the fact 
that I miss her does not change. I look forward
to her coming back.

The past two weeks have been fucking ANNOYING.
I've been having to drive in way MORE than I'm 
used to and it's getting way old way fast. The
fact that I happen to live about 1.5 hours from 
the place I work SUCKS. I don't know how much
more of this commute I can take. It seems to be
becoming a daily thing and wasting 3 hours of
my day to driving seems far to excessive.

I need to go to a masseus bad. My back has more
knots in it then a boy scout training rope. 
Sharon suggested I go see her mom, I'll probably
take her up on that offer. 

Okay, bed time. I'm falling asleep as I type...
