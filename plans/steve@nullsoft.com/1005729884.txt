Wow, that last update was pretty friggin'
long. It was a damn good one too. Anyway,
whatever, i'm bored right now and I 
thought it might be nice to go ahead and 
write a little somethin' somethin', if
you know what i'm sayin'.

We're doin' some Lord of the Rings promo
this week or something, so look forward 
to that. I'm sure it'll be really lame 
and stupid, actually, this one is gonna
be kinda cool.

You know, it's really nice to sit here in
your room and just listen to some music
and not really do anything. It's actually
damn nice. Calms the soul.

Daniel sent me a book from South Africa,
it's called 'Cacas : The encyclopedia of
poo'. God bless his soul. He is one of
those lads you meet once in a life time 
and hold on to forever. Good stuff I say.

Hmm, some Ben Folds Five just came on,
reminds me of Andrea. Hi Andie, how are
you back in Ireland. I know you'll read 
this some day. That'll be nice to hear
from you again.

Girlfriends are cool. When you find one
that's not fucking crazy or strung-out. I
wonder where I can find my own :) Really,
Sharon is probably one of the best things
that has happened to me in recent times.
A really great healthy relationship with 
no chaos. Good for the mind and the soul.

21 inch monitors are damn cool. Lots of 
pixels == you can work from your bed. Heh.

That is all.

by the way, Francis, you damn stupid
frenchman, come back, we miss you.
