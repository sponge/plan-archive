Happy Cinco De Mayo everyone. Let's all go
out and get trashed while shooting our hand
pistols in the air!

All I have to say is holy fucking shit. So
where to begin, huh? All I have to say is
that we've all been working our fucking
asses off. It seems like most of us are 
working like 16-18 hour days. All I gotta 
say is when this work is done, I'm taking
a fucking vacation.

I have to tell ya though... It's been a 
lot of fucking fun working lately. There's
still so much to be done and there's no 
doubt about that, however, it's been pretty
exciting finally seeing things REALLY start
coming together. It makes me proud to be 
part of this team of really talented people.

I think that once Winamp3 is done... The 
really kick ass shit is going to begin. Some
of you might be disappointed with what Winamp3
has to offer, but patient the cool stuff 
comes later.

Anyway, I gotta book my flight for e3...
