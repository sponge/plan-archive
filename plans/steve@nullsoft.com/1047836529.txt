Ugh. I went to a party last night at a friends house. I
got drunk. Drunk to the point in fact that I ended up 
puking on the curb outside his house. I hadn't done for
a few years now. I had forgotten how shitty it feels to
have to throw up. I'm laying in bed right now and it's 
beautiful outside. All I want to do is sleep for a few
hours but the hustle and bustle of the day is already too
loud. It would be difficult to sleep.

I hung out and talked to this girl named Maral that I
graduated high school with. I was very blown away at how
different she really was. How much more depth she has.
I too am a lot different since the last we really spoke.
I'm much more mature than I was 4 years ago. So I suppose
I shouldn't be so surprised. 

I think I'm going to take a nap.

I'll be back...
