God help me. I'm going to LA for Christmas. Boy, that's
going to be a LOT of fun. I can totally feel it. NOT. 
Sharon's coming with me, that should be fun. We'll go
terrorize my friends and family.

Forums upgrade coming soon, today or tomorrow. Hurray.

Uhm, nothing else to really talk about.

Oh yeah, I very much dislike a certain QA manager here.
He has proven to be extremely difficult to work with, 
uncompromising, and seems to not really care about how
their actions impact the products and the users that
they are supporting. How's that for some real iniative?

That's just my 2 cents.
