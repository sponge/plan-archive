March 17, 2003 - 1:31AM

All we keep doing while we're down here is eating. Jesus.
I had In 'n' Out for lunch, then BJ's for dinner. I feel
like I'm going to be a fatass by the time I get back.

I can't wait to get back. Life pauses when I'm out here,
it's just not right.

Fuck it, I'm going to bed.

Good night.
