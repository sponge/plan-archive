Well, I got back from LA yesterday afternoon,
it was actually a pretty decent trip. I was 
expecting a horrible time, but it went by
and left LA relieved that I got into two 
arguments with my mum. That's a miracle, if
I've ever heard one.

So now I'm back home, and I'm very greatful
for being home. However, I came home to a 
flat tire on my car. That totally sucked, I
was going to go out to a nice dinner, instead,
I got fucked at the used car-lot. I'm going
to change my tire sometime this afternoon.
Shitty part is that I have to get the tire 
repaired now, if that's even an option,
otherwise, I gotta go somewhere and buy a new
one.

The new Winamp alpha is out. It's totally tits.
There are still a few goodies that haven't
been released, I guess you're just going to 
have to wait till the next alpha.

Herro Amanda! :) 

I'm out, I'll come back later.
