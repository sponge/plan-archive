Holy shit. I can't wait. I'm two days away from
going on vacation. Thank god. The idea of going
underwater and Scuba diving is driving me nuts.

I think I made up my mind. Once the new PowerMac
G5 (the PPC 970 based) machines are released, I'm
going to lay down the cold hard cash and get me
new machine. I'm so anxious. Sharon decided that
she's going to go buy a new miniDV camera so that
we can start making short little films and stuff
with it. I'm looking forward to getting into 
video editing. I wonder if Canon or Sony make a 
miniDV camera that have an underwater kit... I'd
be stoked if that was the case. If anyone knows
of one, please let me know.

I went out last night to go see a hip-hop show
in Santa Cruz. The band I saw "The Moonies" were
pretty amazing. I know two of the band members.
It always freaks my shit when I see them perform 
because you end up having like a room of teenagers
screaming, jumping, and hopping around like little
rabbits. 

Anyway, time to watch some cheesy movie about a 
boy and his dog.
