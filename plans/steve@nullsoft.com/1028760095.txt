Oh fucking shit. We're almost fucking there.
3 years of work is about to pay off in one
huge titanic orgasm. I'm not talking about
losing my virginity, I lost that long ago. 
I'm talking about Winamp3. Yes folks. The 
time is finally upon us. The clusterfuck 
that has been the past three years is about
to spew forth the latest incarnation of 
Winamp. Hurray for fucking us.

Oh shit, i got more work to do... talk to 
y'all later.
