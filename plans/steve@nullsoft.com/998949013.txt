August 27, 2001 - 2:10PM

Last week was one of the hardest weeks of
my enitre life. I saw some of my closest 
friends be asked to leave. AOL made some 
sweeping changes and it affected the entire
company in a very profound way.

This week has been a bumpy start, that's
for sure. I don't know what to feel or how
to act. I've written an article addressing
what happened and it will be published on
the site rather soon. I think on Wednesday
to be more exact. Regardless, the future
is very different from what it was a mere
week ago. 

There have been changes of titanic
proportions over the last two years. The
most notable being that being at Nullsoft
has changed. It has definately transformed
into a job. Am I happy about that?  I don't
know yet. It's been challenging but also 
quite concerning. I was speaking with Brennan
about this the other night on the phone
while we were trying to figure out where 
our priorities should lie. He told me that
I have an amazing tollerance for stupidity.
I agree.

Perhaps it is not that I'm tollerant of
stupidity, but more so stupid my self. Maybe
I'm just naive. I spend quite a bit of time
devoted to our causes trying to spread word
about our mission and why we are all here,
and yet perhaps it falls on deaf ears. I don't
know. I'll make my decision over the next
year. I would like to see where we all are 
within a year, that's when the true outcome
of our fates will be clear as crystal.

I'm going to go out and lay in the sun.
I can only hope that that might cheer me up,
or maybe not.
