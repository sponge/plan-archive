Man, I really love my Mac. I mean seriously,
apple get's like 1000 bonus points for style.
The damn thing is just beautiful. Every aspect
of it has so much attention to detail. Steve
Jobs is my hero. I look foward to the MacWorld,
I'm wondering what new goodies I'll have to 
play with.

If anyone knows if there's processor upgrades
for my G4, please let me know where I can find
it. I've got a 450, I'd like to make it
something much faster, if I can.

I slept devestantingly late last night. It was
quite unfortunate. This morning I woke up like
a total zombie. I don't know how it happened,
but it did. I wonder when I got too old for
this shit. I mean, just a few years ago, me and
my friends in LA would stay out on all hours of
the night. Now I can't stay up passed midnight
without feeling like a walking turd the next
day. So sad.

Today we went to this restaurant on the way
home through the mountains. The place is called
Alice's Restaurant. Dave and I were just sitting
around and chatting. It's amazing how bad guys
are. There was this semi-cute girl who walked in
almost all the guys were just gawking at her,
even ones with girls sitting right across from 
them. Always thinking with the dick I guess.

I'm going to the Warped Tour show on sunday in
SF. I'm pretty excited. I'm going to get to see
a bunch of bands that I've heard so much about 
without experiencing. I've been looking forward
to going to some shows for a while and finally 
I get to do it, better yet, with the chicky that
I love.

Okay, maybe it's time for me to stop writing in
this stupid thing and play my vids. Warcraft 3 
is sucking my will to live.
