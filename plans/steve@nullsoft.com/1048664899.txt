The more time that goes on, the more I realize how much
of a sham this whole fucking war is and how it's all 
just a cover for these fucking assholes in office to exploit
their positions for their own personal gain.

Case in point:

This lovely press release from Halliburton, the oil company 
that Dick Cheney, our most wonderful VP who was the CEO of 
Halliburton. While running Halliburton, he earned roughly 
$60M dollars at it's helm through sallary and stock options 
as pointed out in this BBC article:

Anyone who tries to tell me that this administration is nobel
in their efforts to liberate the Iraqi people is just brain
washed by the spineless media who has done nothing more than
to glorify and package up the war like a fucking prime time
sports event. Don't get me wrong, I'm all about supporting our
troops because they are the ones putting their lives on the
line for making sure that we retain the way of life that we so
presiously hold dear. However, these soldiers shouldn't even
be there right now. Not for something as selfish and short
sighted as a war against the will of UN, and so many Americans
in this very country that are opposed to sending their young
and spouses into the middle of a warzone that they don't care
about. 

Saddam is a menace and a threat not to the American people,
but to those countries around him and the citizens of his 
nation. Drop the fucking cloak of bullshit and admit what
you're doing. You're interested in nothing more than lining
your pocket books and repaying old favors Mr. Bush. Thanks
for nothing.
