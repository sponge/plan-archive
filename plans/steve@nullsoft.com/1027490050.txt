God help us all. My mom is finally coming
to visit. Let's all have a moment of
silence. You may wonder why I'm reacting
this way but there is order in my chaos.

I've lived here in the bay area for what,
3 years now? This is the first time that
my mom is heading out to visit me. Don't
get me wrong, she didn't choose to not 
visit me, it's just hard when you're
tending for someone (my grandma). Now that
she's passed on, my mom has the freedom to
finally come out and pay me a visit.

So with that said... My mom is coming to
visit.... It's gonna be a bumpy road. I 
love my mom and all, but we don't exactly
always get along, so this is going to be 
a test for both of us. Last thing I want
is the Armenian angers bursting out at one
another while Tom, Bonnie, and Sharon are
around. That's just plain embarasing...

Regardless, I need to figure out what the 
hell I'm going to do with her while she's
here. I'll take her around Santa Cruz, and
probably show her all the beauties of where
I live.

Oh god... I think i'm gonna have an anxiety
attack just thinking about it....
