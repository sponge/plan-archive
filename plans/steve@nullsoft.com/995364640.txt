You know what's super scary? When you
think that the condom breaks and the 
chance of your life changing suddenly
jumps about 10,000%. Well, not really 
that bad, but pretty bad. Fortunately
upon further inspection, you realize
the condom aura is fully intact and
everything is seemingly well. All I 
know is, I don't want to feel scared 
like that again.

Who ever said sex was fun musta had 
his tubes tied.

Anyway, life can be a little scary, 
but I guess you realize that it's 
that excitment that makes it all 
worth living, eh?
