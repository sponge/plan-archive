Happy birthday Taline! You're a whole 22 years 
old now! Hurray! (Taline is one of my dearest 
friends, even though I don't talk to her as
much as I'd like to anymore)

I feel kinda funny right now. I caught this 
nasty ass cold which is making me feel like
total shit. I took some Tylenol Cold, and that's
actually helping quite a bit, but it's putting
me in a really weird mood. Silly me. I would
almost be willing to say it's making me feel 
happy, or more love than I would usually feel.

Let's list out the top things that I love right
now:

1. My mom, dad, brother, sharon.
2. My friends (the people in nullsoft are
included)
3. Driving my old nissan and listening to K-Earth
in LA.
4. Bowling at Hollywood Star Lanes.
5. Listening to really good music (Beck's Sea
Change is really good)
6. Laying in bed with the window open and 
hearing the rain out side.
7. Walking outside our house and seeing the view
8. Getting emails from Winamp users telling me 
how much they love Winamp.
9. Santa Cruz, Ca and redwood trees.
10. Eating food that Sharon and I make together.

I think that's a pretty healthy list. I'm now going
to go to bed as I feel a little dilerious. Good
night. I love you all.
