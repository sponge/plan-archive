Hmm, people have been giving me shit for not
doing this. Probably because they're all
obscessed over me or something. Hehe. I don't
know exactly why I haven't been updating my
.plan. Probably because I've just been bored
or something. Who knows...

I got a new camera... I'm really happy about
it. It takes great photographs and it's super
small.. It's the canon powershot s110. It's
the same size as my elph 2 which is not 
a digital camera.

Here are some of the first photographs that
I've taken with my new camera. <a href="http://genghis.winamp.com/~steve/archive/index.phtml?path=house%2F06-04-2001" target="_blank">click here</a>
to see them...

I'm going to be going to LA in a few weeks. I
have a wedding to go to. That should be quite
interesting. I'm going with Taline. I asked
her to come with cause I know that we'll have
a lot of fun just laughing and what not. It'll
be an interesting experience. That's for sure.

It's been kinda nice, I haven't touched a line
of code for the site in a few weeks at least.
I've been writing word documents and emails. I
feel like a manager or something. Heh. I'll 
start working again the moment I don't feel
burned out anymore. I do this to myself once
in a while I guess... Something I'll have to
just get passed I guess.

We had a party at our house the other day. That
was kinda nice. The weather was simply 
beautiful. We had people in the pool and out
on the deck. It was definately a chill-out day.

The next few weeks should be a lot of fun I
think. I'm going to vegas at the end of the 
month just for fun I guess.. Sounds like a 
year of traveling for steve or something. Heh.

Anyway, it's getting late and I gotta get to
the office early tomorrow. Good night.
