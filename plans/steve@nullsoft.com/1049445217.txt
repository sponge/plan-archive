Last night I went to go see Bowling for Columbine.
Wow. As Dave Newton puts it, it's a very important
movie to see. The movie really shifted my
perspective on various issues. It pointed out
things that I had never really noticed before.

When I moved away from LA, I tried to tell my friends
how different the world is outside of there. They
didn't seem to get it. When you're in it, surrounded
by it, it's extremely difficult to see what's real
and what's fake. I think that this movie points out
that very concept. It tells us that, we as citizens
of this country, don't see the big picture, what's
really happening all around us because we're in it.
Knee deep, and it's really at a place that if you
don't take a step back, you'll never realize it.

I urge everyone to go see this movie. It's really
one of those movies that only come out once in a 
blue moon and really make a difference on you. 

On a lighter note. Winamp 2.9 is out. It fucking 
rocks. So far, we've had overwhelming positive
feedback from you, our users. It's been great to see
that people really see that we're trying to make
some really kick ass powerful software. If you don't
have it yet. I recommend that you go download it. 
You won't be let down.
