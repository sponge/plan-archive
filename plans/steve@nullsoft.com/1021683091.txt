This week was meeting hell. What the hell 
happened. I used to be such an insignificant
turd monger, now I'm sitting in meetings
all day long talking about all the great
things we'll all be doing. Whoopdie do.

It's a beautiful day today. What am I doing?
I'm sitting in front of my computer and 
filling out a .plan while i'm giving Susan
a hard time. Oh dear god, I think the dog
just rubbed a piece of turd on my bare foot
when sat down to cuddle with me. Damn it.

I really don't want to go to LA. That place
is the center of all that is evil and unholy
in this world. Well, not completely, San
Francisco has a percertage on that stake, but
never the less, it's pretty bad. I can't
beleive I loved it there. Maybe it was just
because I grew up in the "valley" so now
I'm jaded. 

I wonder how many people still read this 
damn thing. OH GOD, THE DOG FARTED. UGH.
*sigh* kill me now, please.
