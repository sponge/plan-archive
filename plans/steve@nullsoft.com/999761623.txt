September 5, 2001 - 10:51PM

This past few weeks have been quite a the
rollercoaster. Emotions have run from high
to low ever so dramatically. Between the
lay offs and the personal dilemmas I've
faced this month, I'm looking forward to
the period of happiness and tranquility 
with open arms.

For the most part, this past week was a
lot more calm and controlled. The initial
shock is starting to subside and those of
us who are still left in the picture are 
trying to work as fast as we can to help
clean up the mess after the tornado tore
our world to shreads. 

I've said this to a few but I believe it 
more and more. Those of us that are 
remaining are most likely the crew that's
going to go down with the ship. I think 
that if there is another "round" of
layoffs in the future, it will prove to be
the final nail in our coffins and
probably throw "Nullsoft" into non-
existance. But who knows if there will
even be another round of layoffs anytime
soon.

This weekend I came down with a horrible
chest cold. In fact, all of my roommates
did. It's vicious and I hope no one else
gets it. Anyone have any good ideas for
some remedys?

I Need to get some rest if there's any
chance that I'm going to get up tomorrow
morning an drive to the city. Good night.

PS: We made it on fuckedcompany today!
Hurray! At least someone noticed us :)
