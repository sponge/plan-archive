I'm bummed. I broke my PDA. I have one of those
handspring treo 90's. They rock. I don't know 
what happened to it. I picked it up, plugged it
into my PC to sync, and the backlight stopped
working on the screen. It makes me sad. I've
tried to call Handspring techinical support,
unfortunately, it's been relatively difficult
to get through. I'm really sad. It helps me gain
so much control over my life. Without it, it
makes prioritizing really difficult for me.

*sigh*

On the other hand, there are some problems with
the device that I would love to see fixed. The
benefits are that it is super small, fast, 
readable, and very usable. The only thing I had 
to complain about it was the fact that the thing 
didn't have a high-res screen and a keyboard
backlight.

Oh shit, one of my friends just told me he's
getting engaged just now. What the hell is this
world coming to? I'm only turning 23. I know a 
bunch of girls I went to HS with that are already
married. It's not that time yet people, or is it?

At least my dear friend here is not planning on
tying the knot for quite some time, 3 or 4 years 
at least. That's comforting at least.

Okay, time for bed. Nite nite.
