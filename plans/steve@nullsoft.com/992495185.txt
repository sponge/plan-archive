So I laid down the bucks and bought myself
a USB Flash Card reader. However, I can
never seem to win. Why you ask? Well, first
off, I have to boot the computer with the 
stupid reader attached in order for it to
mount the fucking drive. Second off, the 
Mac I'm trying to connect it to doesn't 
have drivers for it.. (macosx). So now what,
Well, I'm stuck.

Last night was awesome. I went to dinner
with Sharon. We went to the Golden Buda,
in Santa Cruz. I had an amazing time. I
always do when I'm with her. It's just
really weird, when I'm with her, I feel
completely my self. Nothing to front. Just
all me. Never been that way with ANYONE 
before. I have to say, every moment I'm 
with her, I'm happy.

So get this, last night, I get to her place
and her roommate greets me at the door.
She tells me "sorry, sharon's not ready
yet, give her a minute" and she scurries
off to the bathroom which is immediately
by the front door. Next thing you know,
"Love me do" by the Beatles comes on and 
I see Sharon slowly coming down the stairs
in this "Romeo/Juliet-esque" dress. She's
slowly dancing, twirling and laughing.
She finally gets to the foot of the stairs
and does a twirl into my arms.

I was blown away. Couldn't have been a more
perfect start to a date. I realized at that
instant that she's as twisted and crazy as 
I am. OH JOY.

It's funny how one moment, they drive you
up the walls and the next moment you're 
barely able to control your thoughts. All 
you want to do is see them again. *sigh*

I think I've found a good one. <a href="http://genghis.winamp.com/~steve/archive/index.phtml?path=trips%2FBig%20Basin%20-%2006-09-2001&img=Uhmm%2C%20yeah.jpg" target="_blank">A really good one.</a>
