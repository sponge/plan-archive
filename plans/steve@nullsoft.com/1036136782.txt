Happy fucking halloween everyone.

Boy did I have a shitty night. On my way home tonight,
I got into an accident with my car. Suffice to say, it
sucked. The car is somewhat drivable, but it sounds
like it's pretty pissed at me. Whatever, at least she
had insurrance.

I've already reported the claim with both my and her 
insurrance companies and am trying to get this dealt
with as soon as possible. 

I just hate fucking car accidents. The car is never
the same after it. They can spend all the fucking money
in the world to fix it, and it'll never be the same.
It's just the way it is. I look forward to selling it
and getting a new car as soon as I can. 

It's funny to have both Bonnie and Me carless now. It
is definately going to be interesting to see how I'm 
going to get to work and back with the car all busted
in.

These things can be so shitty.

At least Newton and I are okay. It could have been much
much worse. I'm just glad the air bags didn't deploy.

Those things hurt.

Anyway, I'm gonna go drink some beers, watch TV, and 
call this a night.

nitey.
