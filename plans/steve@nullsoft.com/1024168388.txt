Woah, it has now been a year since Sharon
and myself have considered ourselves an
item. Goodness gracious has it been a long
long year. We're still goin' strong and 
everyday seems to get better and better.

I've never been in a situation before
where I have never been so happy with 
someone in my life. I had a late start into
the whole relationship thing. I think I
was just looking in the wrong places and
also putting unrealistic expectations on
people that were just not the right match
for me. As they say, "live and learn."

Today is not actually the day we decided,
it's more of a good guess. We don't really
remember the exact day. We do know that it
was somewhere between the 13th and the 18th
or so we figured, how about just the middle
of the month, and so it is. 

I suppose that this day should be a little
tainted by gloom seeing that my grandma 
just passed away two days ago. However, I'm
not sad about her passing. I'm happy for
her. Her life was a long and strenious one.
Her husband, my grand dad, passed over 10
years ago. She's been living a difficult
life since. If there is indeed a place
beyond the mortal realm, then she's gone
there, and I hope that she finds all her
friends and loved ones waiting for her.

I fly to LA on tuesday morning to visit
the family and lay grandmas body to rest.
My mom is really really broken up and I 
completely understand. I've been calling
her almost daily and talking to her,
telling her how much I love her and trying
to be as supportive as possible. It's been
really really hard for her. I just hope
that she remembers how much her children,
husband, and friends really do care about
her.

Regardless, it's been pretty hectic. I'm
going to spend today enjoying the weather,
hanging out with friends, and loving life.
