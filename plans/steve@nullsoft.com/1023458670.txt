June 7, 2002 - 5:01AM

Wow, when was the last time I did an update
at round abouts 5:00AM? By my count, at
least a year or so. What do you owe this
great occasion to? Well, me and the boys are
all up working on Winamp3 right now at
Brennan's house. This is the second thursday
in a row that we've done this and frankly,
it's starting to wear me down big time.

I think I'm probably going to take a nap in
a little while. I was supposed to have a 
meeting of some sort tomorrow but there's
just now way in hell that I'm going to be
around for any fucking meeting. If no one 
can understand that, then fuck them I guess.

I miss my bed at nights. I miss sleeping next
to Sharon. It totally bites balls when
you're just far enough that it's not really
feasible to try to go home just to hop in the
same bed.

I'm starting to see how much of a toll
Winamp3 is really taking on all of the team.
We're all quite irritable and we find reasons
to snap at each other quite too often. I think
that the tensions are higher than they've
probably ever been, at least in terms of most
of the group. I'm looking forward to the day
that this release date is behind us and Winamp
is just out there and being used by people. 
We're not too far off and this is always just
the hard part.

Anyway, I can't think anymore. I'm gonna nap.
