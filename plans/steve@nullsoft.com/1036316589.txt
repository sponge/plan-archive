Man, I really have to give it up to Apple. iTunes 
totally fucking rocks. Winamp3 and iTunes are very
different programs with very different purposes.
But I must admit, that iTunes is a totally great
program. It has some really fantastic qualities.

I downloaded and played with Windows Media Player
9 tonight. It's kinda funny to see how they ripped
us off in some features. Nice to see that the boys
and girls at Redmond are still watching what we're
doing. 

Overall, I was disappointed with WMP9. Had a few 
good qualities, but overall, it was still a steaming
pile of junk. I don't see why they don't just go
and rip off iTunes. They ripped off everything else 
from Mac OS, what's another program?

I love my iPod. Jonathan got me hooked up with a 
20gb iPod, which I'm very thankfull for. It's leaps
better than my 5gb one. I love it very much. Only 
problem is, I've ripped all my music and uploaded it
to the thing, guess what, I've only managed to fill
up 7GB of it. :) 

It'll be a long long time before I fill up the entire
thing. I suppose that's a good thing. How many times 
do people buy things and it's just barely enough.

Anyway, I'm thinking about going to bed. Good night.
