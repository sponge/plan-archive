Well here's my first .plan post!  Whooo!  Hi world!
  
It looks like Quakecon 2001 was garnered as a success this year,(i got a free shirt: free shirt = success/w00t!) I think these next couple of years will be a great time for gamers and I can't wait to see what other developers release with these advances in technology.

Speaking of advances in technology; I'm anxious to play around with the new Creative card (Audigy) once it becomes available...sounds pretty nifty to me.

To all of you crazy sound-designers out there; I'd like to point you in the direction of Hellchick's new site "Vox Feminae", it's a nice little place to gather at talk about all things Aural:
