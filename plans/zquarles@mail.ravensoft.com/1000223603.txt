Okay; it looks like I will be one of the first to make a .plan update regarding the attack.  

I will make a warning right now that I will probably upset some people regarding my views.

I am truly terrified to what this will bring for our country's future.  I am terrified of war and hoped I would never see it in my life time.  I have looked through some of the newsgroups and have been horrified at some of the remarks stating "we should nuke whoever's responsible."

Nuclear War is not the answer.  We are not the only country with nuclear capabilities.  If we use a nuclear weapon on a country it could (and probably would) start a chain-reaction leading to the end of this planet as we know it.  We live in an incredibly dangerous time and I suggest people think about the people that have lost their lives & families and the scope of tragedy that has occured in our great nation.
