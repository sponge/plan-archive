Whoohoo!  QuakeCon 2003!

For those of you in the Chicago area and interested in theatre, I attended an entertaining production of Howard Korder's "Boys' Life" by a group of friends and talented actors that go by the name of "Open Cage Ensemble".  Here is more information, blatantly ripped from their PR junkets:
Open Cage Ensemble presents “Boys’ Life” by Howard Korder opening August 8, at the Cornservatory, 4210 N. Lincoln. Showtimes are Fridays and Saturdays at 10:30pm thru September 5th and Thursday September 4th at 8pm. Tickets are $10 with a group rate of $7 available for a group of 10 or more. For reservations please call 773.525.1668
