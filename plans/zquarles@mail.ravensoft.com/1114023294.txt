R.I.P. Billy "Wicked" Wilson

I was reading Billy's posts on VE3D long before I even considered working in the games industry...At that time, I was happily running "VQuake" on my old Intergraph and desparately trying to save some coin for a Monster3D.  His posts would always make me laugh out loud and I was very disappointed that gaminggroove.com never quite got the footing that VE3D did.  My condolences to his family and friends.  You will be missed.
