I wanted to send out a few thank-you's today:

Firstly to the teams behind the Game News sites ala, Blue's News, VoodooExtreme, and The Shack (those are the ones that I regularly check anyway) for picking up some bandwidth from the Major news sites (CNN, MSNBC, etc) and keeping us all informed when the other sites were too bogged down.  You guys rule.

Second, to the many news anchors/reporters (which will probably never read this) that stayed around the clock to give us all new information as it came and in certain instances risked life and limb.  You all certainly earned your salaries and should probably be given a big fat raise.  

Lastly but CERTAINLY not leastly: I thank with all of my heart and soul to many, many volunteers that have the horrible task of cleanup in the NYC, Washington, and Pittsburgh areas.  They are truly great people and will need as much assistance as possible, both physically and emotionally.  I can't imagine what they will encounter, and only wish I could help more.  The only way I can think to help would be to give blood, eventhough I only weigh 111 pounds; I think it's worth passing out for.  

My thoughts and feelings are with the friends and families of the victims; and with my own friends and family.

ps: Melissa and Michael, I'm sure you're okay but could you each please call me back or reply to my emails just to keep my mind at ease?
