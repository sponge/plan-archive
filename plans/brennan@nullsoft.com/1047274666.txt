Project: blah blah Winamp3 blah blah
Plan:
Wasabi development is not over nor dead. Think of it more as Winamp 2.x is getting Wasabified!
If we do things right you'll be able to load your Winamp3 components into Winamp
right alongside your Winamp 2.x plugins, while still being able to just install Winamp 2.9 if
you prefer that, or just Winamp3 if you prefer that. Basically, you'll be able to run
Winamp 2.x skins in their native skin engine, and Winamp3 skins in theirs.

Should be pretty cool. ;)
