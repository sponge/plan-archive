Wow, I haven't written a .plan update in forever. Does anyone even read these
any more?

I'm now past my 2-year anniversary of starting at Nullsoft... how things
have changed.

I kinda miss the bizarre idealism of 1999... The idea that we could actually
change the world with a network. Instead, corporatism encroaches and life
gets marginalized. Remember when it was a sick joke to say "Hey! They're only
trying to make money!" instead of it being accepted as a reason for fucking
people over? Or was it always like this and I only now notice?
