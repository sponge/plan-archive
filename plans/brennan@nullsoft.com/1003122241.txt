Having read yet more comments, I think you guys are totally missing something:

Our open-fucking-source SDK. It's 1.5 megabytes of C++ code, zlib-type
licensed, mostly debugged, pretty portable, and happens to comprise about 90%
of the *exact same code* we use to build Winamp3 itself.

Do you see the point now?

Do I have to fucking spell it out for you?

Dear /.

We ported it to Linux because we *like* Linux. Calm down.

Sincerely,
Brennan

Well, I'm back, goddammit.

The layoffs didn't really hit home until I had to move all those names in AIM from
the "Gaybags" group to the "Ex-Gaybags" group. It's getting crowded in there.

Eh, fuck.

Wow, I haven't written a .plan update in forever. Does anyone even read these
any more?

I'm now past my 2-year anniversary of starting at Nullsoft... how things
have changed.

I kinda miss the bizarre idealism of 1999... The idea that we could actually
change the world with a network. Instead, corporatism encroaches and life
gets marginalized. Remember when it was a sick joke to say "Hey! They're only
trying to make money!" instead of it being accepted as a reason for fucking
people over? Or was it always like this and I only now notice?
