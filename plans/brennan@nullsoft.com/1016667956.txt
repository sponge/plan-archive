Sonique 2 alpha is out. To celebrate, here is our prealpha from almost

Hmm, my first .plan update in a while. What the fuck is there to say?
How long have I been working here now? I can't even remember any more.
Thank god wa3 is almost done-- I think I'm starting to fade. What does
a nervous breakdown feel like anyway?

But, Winamp3 is getting kick-ass. Beta 3 will be out once QA gets done with it.
Wasabi is starting to be an awesome little system to develop on, too.

I'm starting to figure things out in life, stuff that has confused me since
I was a little kid. I just want to get my old-man wisdom down while I'm
still young enough to use it for something.
