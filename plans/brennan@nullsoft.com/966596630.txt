Why, none other than architect and head such-and-such for Winamp 3.0.
Codename Wasabi. Why this fails to get me all the chicks I'll never know.

Gawd, my face hurts. I had my wisdom teeth out this past Tuesday. Healing
seems to be taking much longer than I anticipated. So... lots of soup,
drugs, and almost no work getting done. :( Oh well, at least I can plan
what I'll do when I get back.

Ah, www.monkeyradio.net is up and running again. Thanks Justin. :)

I can't wait to ship Winamp 3.0 so all the magazines
etc. can say "Wow! Justin's done it again!" :/ At the risk of seeming petty,
I'd like to point out *I* created this particular Winamp. Essentially, at
least.  Don't get me wrong, Justin + Francis + Christophe have all contributed
quite a lot too. But it was my design. Eh, whatever. I just want it to get
OUT there, un-fucked-up by corporatism. We'll see.

Speaking of un-fucked-up by corporatism, Vorbis is lookin' sexy. I almost
hope it *doesn't* sound as good as they say so I don't have to re-encode
300+ CDs all over again... If/when they ever get out of beta mode
Winamp 3.0 will be all over that shit ASAP if it really does kick MP3's ass.
They do need a catchier extension than OGG though.

I friggin' hate software patents. And predatory business practices. And
corporate dickwaving in general. Fucking quit PowerPoint and go MAKE SOMETHING!
Sheesh.
