Project:
Unreal Tournament
Plan:
The knowledge that Unreal Tournament is finished is now public.
I suppose I should go home and rest and be filled with some
great sense of accomplishment.  Instead, I'm spending all my
time at work, as usual, learning UnrealED and messing with
various programming projects.  It will be nice to start on the
next game.  Cut some new territory, learn more.  Do stuff.

I don't really feel any kind of overwhelming "I've done it."
I might feel that when I see the box, but for the most part
I just feel ready to keep going.  I felt accomplishment for
each element I added to the game, each problem solved, and
that is sufficient.

I am very proud of Unreal Tournament.  I think that it was a
good first project.  I've experienced a bit of everything and
have met a lot of incredibly talented people.  I've learned
things I never thought I would know.  I've done things I
never thought I would do or be able to do.

Epic is an incredible company.  A year and a half ago when I was
in college, I would never have imagined that such a company
could exist.  This year has been the best of my entire life,
without equal.  Without compare.

Tim, thanks for the chance.  Thanks for putting trust in me.
