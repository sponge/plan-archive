Unreal Tournament

Update:

It is not necessary to run the Linux dedicated server as root and you should not do this.
If you have difficulty starting remote web administration, edit the UnrealTournament.ini
and change the UT Web Server's ServerPort to something other than 80.  For example you
might change it to ServerPort=8080 and then connect in Netscape using this URL:
http://127.0.0.1:8080/ServerAdmin/


If you are running Slackware 4 or another libc 5 based Linux distribution, the Linux
dedicated server will generate a segmentation fault in libpthread.so.  This is because
the dedicated server was built using glibc 2.

Its very frustrating that Linux distributions can vary so much in such a fundamental way.

Here is a link to the glibc HOWTO:
http://www.imaxx.net/~thrytis/glibc/Glibc2-HOWTO.html

The HOWTO discusses methods of upgrading from libc 5 to glibc 2.  I really don't know
how practical upgrading is.  I do know that I don't have the time to install a libc 5
system and maintain two linux distributions for the purposes of supporting both
configurations.  From reading the document, it appears that it would not be difficult
to upgrade, however I am not a Linux guru and cannot give sound advice on the matter.
I wouldn't want anyone to screw up their system.

On to the good news.  I just played with the Linux client for a long time and all the
crash bugs seem to be gone.  Its now just a matter of working on ways of improving
performance.

Hey, wouldn't it be cool if GameSpot had a secure polling system that people couldn't
use flood bots against?
