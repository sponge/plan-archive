Plan:
It would really, _really_ kick ass if anyone out there that knows how to get
a copy of the following CDs could give me a yell.  I can't find the CDs on
CDNOW or Amazon, I'm sure that they are all out of print.  Nonetheless, I
would really like to own a copy and if you own these CDs in very good
condition, I'd like to buy them from you:

Circle of Dust: Brainchild
Circle of Dust: Re-Release
Tourniquet: Psycho Surgery

I'm not a Christian, but I certainly appriciate good music.  Circle of Dust
and Tourniquet are very devout Christian bands, but also two of the best
musical groups out there.  Circle of Dust is pure industrial and Tourniquet
is a really heavy/death metal group.  Anyway, if you have these CDs and are
willing to part with them or you know a music store that still has them,
give me a yell.
