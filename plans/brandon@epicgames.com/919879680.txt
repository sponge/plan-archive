Plan:
Since .plan tracking is distributed across a lot of different services these
days, I thought I'd just post this here.

My .plan will be at:
greenmarine@finger.epicgames.com
I should be listed as Brandon Reinhart, Programmer

Also you can now get our lead designer James Schmalz at:
james@finger.epicgames.com
he should be listed as James Schmalz, Lead Designer

Alan Willard, Pancho and some others will be getting plans also, I'll try to
figure out what the major tracking services are and send their maintainers
emails before then.

There is also a web server running at:

http://finger.epicgames.com/

I don't know what I'll put up here.  Maybe just a "cool shit from the dev
team" page with various bits.  Shane and some of the others have been
frustrated that the Epic programmers have a "Tech Page" :-)
