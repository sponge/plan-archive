Plan:
Been playing a lot of Half-Life deathmatch lately.  I like it because it is
excessively violent.   There are a couple things that really need to be
changed though.

1. The respawn sound is loud and annoying.
2. There aren't any pain/death sounds! What the hell?
3. The deathmessages suck! This game needs real death messages.
4. The chat system sucks! What is the chat window some little ass thing down
in the corner? The game feels so non-social.

If Valve doesn't fix these things, I'll release a mod that does after they
release their SDK.  Hell, maybe those cool cats over at HREF="http://www.netgamesusa.com/">www.netgamesusa.com will want to port
their pretty damn cool Tourney
Control System over to Half-Life, in which case I might ask if they want
the code in there.  Personally, I've had a lot of fun playing Half-Life
deathmatch, now that Epic has a T1.

BRAG MODE
I'm usually on the WON.net servers as GreenMarine and I have yet to finish a
game at anything less than first place. Muahahaha.
UNBRAG MODE

I'm finding my gaming time split between TRIBES, Half-Life, and Starcraft.
There are just too many cool games out now.

I noticed that Blue has been mentioning the coolness of LAN parties lately
and I must agree.  Are there any LAN parties in the Raleigh triangle area?
