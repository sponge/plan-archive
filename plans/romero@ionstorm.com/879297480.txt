Yep, got beat down last night by Joey in DOOM II.
NaTaS was training him and he did a great job,
but tonight Joey is going to be facing his very
worst fears up close and personal when we go at
it again.

Just got my Wild Arms soundtrack CD -- sounds
pretty awesome!

Currently reading Rendevous With Rama.

You know a movie is a big success when you have
half your company breaking into discussion/arguing
groups for a few hours immediately after returning
from the local Cinemark.

My opinion: Starship Troopers rocks the house down,
hardcore!  Sure, the plot is a loaf and the acting
is passable, but who cares?  Every movie that you
go to has decent acting and interesting plots. What
does ST have that all other movies don't have?

Hardcore FX and hardcore action.  This movie is a
perfect personification of DOOM -- it's the blunt,
explosive, manic experience of the movie that really
blows you away.  Not some amazing plot or breakthrough
acting by a newcomer vying for an Oscar.  It's a
bone-breaking, badass action thrillfest.  When
someone dies, the camera doesn't pan away at the
last minute -- it zeros in on the death and shows
it in all its gory glory!  GIBFEST!  

Just the way I like it.  This entire movie is all
about the action and FX, nothing else.  And the FX
are the best I've ever seen, period.

The movie that I'm waiting for that I expect to
have a lot of integrity in its plot, acting and FX
is Alien Resurrection.  I expect Aliens+.  But
with Starship Troopers, I wasn't expecting much
but instead got blown away, hardcore.

The Frag was cool.  A bunch of guys took some time
out and came over to Ion Storm to play some hardcore
DOOM II deathmatch for a few hours (Blue, Joost,
OneThumb, etc.)  Very fun.

About the AoE review: since I'm not a "realtime
strategy nut", I guess you shouldn't take my advice
unless you keep your head in first-person shooters.
At least that's what Steve Bauman at Strategy Plus
thinks.  HE should know a good RTS, not me.

BTW: I've never been paid to endorse anything.  My
endorsements came from my believing that the product
was good.  I don't use a WingMan Warrior, but it's
a good thing for people who can't play simultaneously
with a keyboard and mouse.  I like AoE, not because
I'm friends with Ensemble, but because Bruce Shelley
(and to a lesser extent, Sandy Peterson) created a
very well-balanced Warcraft2/Civ-style RTS game.

Had my "description" changed.  I didn't set it that
way in the first place, MIS did.

I'm sorry and embarassed about the .plan war that
happened yesterday.  We should never have responded
to Paul's latest update and I offer my apologies
to the great gaming community that had to sit and
watch their favorite game companies act like children.

This should not happen again.  I have the utmost
respect for John Carmack, Adrian Carmack, Kevin
Cloud and the other people who worked long and hard
on Quake 2.  I know that people's perception of
a company is partly based on the .plan file updates
and I don't want anyone thinking that Ion Storm
is of low quality based on low quality .plan info.

I can't wait to play Quake 2.  Ship it!

I have never been a realtime strategy nut, I'm mostly
a first-person action hardcore gamer.  I played C&C
a little bit last year, but I wasn't really impressed
too much with it and didn't really pursue checking
out any other "hot" RTS titles.

I just played the beta of Age of Empires and it is
a truly awesome game.  Sure, you start out picking 
berries, farming, chopping down trees, etc.  But when 
you build your civilization up to the point where you 
enter a new age (Tool Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age), it's 
awesome how much more you can do.  This game does
civilization development and warfare (land & sea) very
well.  There are numerous multiplayer options and a
scenario editor is included, written by our very own
Mickey Kawick.  The CD music is very cool as well.
Just playing the title track makes me want to start
up a new game and destroy someone's civilization!
Go out and buy Age of Empires from Microsoft,
developed by our buds over at Ensemble Studios here
in Dallas.

Man, i'm moving my .plan over to html pretty soon. :)

Daikatana has the exact same type of randomized spawn
spots that Q2 will have: find all spots where the least
amount of people are and pick a random one of those
found.  Note that picking up your backpack after you
respawn is only cool if your killer is nowhere near it,
which is about 5% of the time.  Thus, uncool.

Got the Froginator animating and it looks really
excellent!  It's the first model that we have 
properly animated in the game so far.


May 7, 1997
------------------------------------------------
Whoa, long break away from updating the .plan!

Daikatana is rocking along very well, the E3 demo
is gonna be really cool.

I'm a bit disappointed that Hexen 2 is being
named just that.  I thought that Hecatomb would
have been a really great name and carried the
naming convention of the series to a logical end.
Doesn't this sound great: Heretic, Hexen, Hecatomb?
Heretic, Hexen, Hexen 2.  Whatever. :(

That was a great April Fool's joke yesterday, eh?
No WAY is Onethumb working here! HA HA HA HA HA!

I've had a great idea for another game i'd like
to develop and i've asked OneThumb, who is a
great idea guy, to head up the project with me
as Executive Producer.  It's in a different 
genre than our other games and is going to rock!

Went muddin' in my brand-new fly-yellow Hummer.
Scared some dudes on the Dallas Tollway, i think.

Whoa.  I didn't feel *too* sorry for Carmack after
hearing that his F40 got tapped by a truck since
he left a massively expensive Ferrari parked outside
all day.  But after i found out the extent of the
damage and how much it will cost to fix, i now
feel pretty bad.  I would hate to have to pay for
that amount of random damage.  That does suck.


March 25, 1997

The F40 got hit. Carma.

The only stuff left to create are all the
artifacts.  The design doc should be done Friday.

The www-book Halcyon Days is finished. Check out

I'm gonna miss Abrash, he's a great guy and an
amazing codesmith.
