I've been corrected by Brandon at id that Paul Jaquays actually did the
majority of the work on "train" .. sorry Paul.  id has tried to keep
specific map credits out of the game mainly because almost all of the maps
were "touched" by more than one person.  Personally, i believe that the
person with the most amount of time spent in a map deserves credit.

And about the latest Daikatana ads in the magazines: sorry if i offended
your tender sensibilities by telling you i'm gonna make you my bitch. :)


December 11, 1997
------------------------------------------------
I want to update on 2 important topics that just
happened to coincide within days of each other.

-----------------
Topic #1: Quake 2

Before i say anything, you simply MUST go out and
buy yourself a copy of Quake 2, a Monster 3D
video card and a P200 (just in case you have a
slower system :)

I was pretty skeptical of the Q2Demo that was
released last month, mostly because of the 10hz
input problem and the fact that the sound fx
were pretty bad.  Of course, i'm not going to
update my .plan to tell everyone that i didn't
like the demo.  We're all pretty .plan political
these days. :)

But as soon as Quake 2 was released i ran out
and bought some copies, put on the headphones,
turned out the lights, set the GL mode and
set forth on my long journey...

Oh my god.

Quake 2 is the most impressive game i've ever
played on a computer.

Mind you, i have a different viewpoint than
anyone out there. Some people have argued this
point with me, saying that DOOM definitely had
a more profound impact than Quake 2.  I never
got to see DOOM spring forth from the nether
regions of the internet, seemingly out of
nowhere, like everyone else on the planet.
Therefore, it couldn't have as profound an
effect on me.

Quake 2's graphics are simply amazing. The
colored lighting MAKES this game.  If you're
playing the game in software (non-GL), no WAY
is Q2 going to blow you completely away.
[I'm so excited to get Daikatana running under
the Q2 engine!  We have the source code right
now and preliminary tests look awesome!]

I've heard some negative discussion on the Net
regarding the CD music, but i TOTALLY LOVE IT!
Playing Q2 with the music really gets your
adrenaline pumping!  I wish i knew the names
of the songs, because my favorite song is
track 6.  Wow.  I'm a guitar junkie, hardcore.

I'm a map designer at heart and the levels in
Quake 2 are the most beautifully architected
alternate realities i've ever experienced.
They are so much better than Quake 1's maps
that i'm almost embarassed to see my earlier
work and say that it's still good. The
majority of the maps were created by Tim Willits,
the lead designer on the project.  Tim did
22 of the maps and had a hand in the other
17 maps that were created by American, Brandon,
Jaquays and Xian.  Awesome work, Tim!

The level textures, models and animations
done by Adrian, Kevin and Steed are just
amazing and really create a cohesive, dark
mood throughout the entire game.  No other
company has thus far matched id's trademark
grungy, dark, hardcore art style.

Q2 deathmatch rules.  The weapon balance is
so much better than Q1.  id definitely copied
DOOM in this area (among other areas) and the
results are magnificent.  No more Q1 deathmatch
for me -- Q2 all the way, baby.  (Although
i think the rocket launcher should have a
larger radius of damage and go a slight bit
faster.  And maybe a better sound effect.  Ok,
i'm being nit-picky. :)

I've already beaten the game and am going to
do it all over again this weekend.  This is
definitely not something i do with every game,
but when you are profoundly affected by a
game like Quake 2, you want to experience it
all over again.  Then maybe once more.

After you play Quake 2, you need to ask yourself
this question, especially if you are a super-
critical 3D shooter nitpicker:

What game have you played lately that was
better than Quake 2?

I predict the answer is none.

Some of you out there may be interested in this
information, so here's a list of the Quake 2 maps
and who created them. (Thanks to Tim Willits)

Topic #2: DOOM

Yesterday was pretty busy and i forgot to update
my .plan on a VERY important date, the fourth
birthday of something near and dear to me, DOOM.

Happy Birthdy, DOOM!

It's been an amazing four years since DOOM was
released, especially in terms of the impact it
had on the entire game industry.  So much time
spent inside that world, so much energy
expended on the creation of data for DOOM and
the destruction of opponents in deathmatch.

Even this long after DOOM's release, there is
an active community that continues to support
the game.  Daily news updates, new levels
being created, new graphics, music and sprites
are still being made to extend DOOM beyond
anything we ever imagined.

There's a lot of interesting information on
DOOM out there that a lot of you may have never
seen, such as the very first screenshots of DOOM
that i ever released, the earliest pirated
alphas of the game, the infamous leaked beta,
etc.  Lots of stuff has accumulated and now is
a good time to check it out.

I've picked a few sites to represent them all
because they seem to have the most interesting
information out there on DOOM.

Functional Entropy:
http://entropy.telefragged.com/index2.html
(great site, even though they aren't excited
about any of Ion Storm's games...yet)

Arcane DOOM Stuff:
http://www.trailerpark.com/tequila/killough/doom.html
(Awesome historical information!)

With the imminent release of the DOOM source
code, a flurry of activity in the DOOM scene is
taking place.  After GLDOOM is completed, people
will once again inhabit the world of DOOM on
the latest 3D video hardware and perhaps inspire
some to relive the experience all over again...

Long live DOOM!

Yep, got beat down last night by Joey in DOOM II.
NaTaS was training him and he did a great job,
but tonight Joey is going to be facing his very
worst fears up close and personal when we go at
it again.

Just got my Wild Arms soundtrack CD -- sounds
pretty awesome!

Currently reading Rendevous With Rama.


November 10, 1997
------------------------------------------------
You know a movie is a big success when you have
half your company breaking into discussion/arguing
groups for a few hours immediately after returning
from the local Cinemark.

My opinion: Starship Troopers rocks the house down,
hardcore!  Sure, the plot is a loaf and the acting
is passable, but who cares?  Every movie that you
go to has decent acting and interesting plots. What
does ST have that all other movies don't have?

Hardcore FX and hardcore action.  This movie is a
perfect personification of DOOM -- it's the blunt,
explosive, manic experience of the movie that really
blows you away.  Not some amazing plot or breakthrough
acting by a newcomer vying for an Oscar.  It's a
bone-breaking, badass action thrillfest.  When
someone dies, the camera doesn't pan away at the
last minute -- it zeros in on the death and shows
it in all its gory glory!  GIBFEST!

Just the way I like it.  This entire movie is all
about the action and FX, nothing else.  And the FX
are the best I've ever seen, period.

The movie that I'm waiting for that I expect to
have a lot of integrity in its plot, acting and FX
is Alien Resurrection.  I expect Aliens+.  But
with Starship Troopers, I wasn't expecting much
but instead got blown away, hardcore.


November 3, 1997
------------------------------------------------
The Frag was cool.  A bunch of guys took some time
out and came over to Ion Storm to play some hardcore
DOOM II deathmatch for a few hours (Blue, Joost,
OneThumb, etc.)  Very fun.

About the AoE review: since I'm not a "realtime
strategy nut", I guess you shouldn't take my advice
unless you keep your head in first-person shooters.
At least that's what Steve Bauman at Strategy Plus
thinks.  HE should know a good RTS, not me.

BTW: I've never been paid to endorse anything.  My
endorsements came from my believing that the product
was good.  I don't use a WingMan Warrior, but it's
a good thing for people who can't play simultaneously
with a keyboard and mouse.  I like AoE, not because
I'm friends with Ensemble, but because Bruce Shelley
(and to a lesser extent, Sandy Peterson) created a
very well-balanced Warcraft2/Civ-style RTS game.

Had my "description" changed.  I didn't set it that
way in the first place, MIS did.


November 1, 1997
------------------------------------------------
I'm sorry and embarassed about the .plan war that
happened yesterday.  We should never have responded
to Paul's latest update and I offer my apologies
to the great gaming community that had to sit and
watch their favorite game companies act like children.

This should not happen again.  I have the utmost
respect for John Carmack, Adrian Carmack, Kevin
Cloud and the other people who worked long and hard
on Quake 2.  I know that people's perception of
a company is partly based on the .plan file updates
and I don't want anyone thinking that Ion Storm
is of low quality based on low quality .plan info.

I can't wait to play Quake 2.  Ship it!


September 23, 1997

I have never been a realtime strategy nut, I'm mostly
a first-person action hardcore gamer.  I played C&C
a little bit last year, but I wasn't really impressed
too much with it and didn't really pursue checking
out any other "hot" RTS titles.

I just played the beta of Age of Empires and it is
a truly awesome game.  Sure, you start out picking
berries, farming, chopping down trees, etc.  But when
you build your civilization up to the point where you
enter a new age (Tool Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age), it's
awesome how much more you can do.  This game does
civilization development and warfare (land & sea) very
well.  There are numerous multiplayer options and a
scenario editor is included, written by our very own
Mickey Kawick.  The CD music is very cool as well.
Just playing the title track makes me want to start
up a new game and destroy someone's civilization!
Go out and buy Age of Empires from Microsoft,
developed by our buds over at Ensemble Studios here
in Dallas.

Man, i'm moving my .plan over to html pretty soon. :)

Daikatana has the exact same type of randomized spawn
spots that Q2 will have: find all spots where the least
amount of people are and pick a random one of those
found.  Note that picking up your backpack after you
respawn is only cool if your killer is nowhere near it,
which is about 5% of the time.  Thus, uncool.


May 12, 1997
------------------------------------------------
Got the Froginator animating and it looks really
excellent!  It's the first model that we have
properly animated in the game so far.


May 7, 1997
------------------------------------------------
Whoa, long break away from updating the .plan!

Daikatana is rocking along very well, the E3 demo
is gonna be really cool.

I'm a bit disappointed that Hexen 2 is being
named just that.  I thought that Hecatomb would
have been a really great name and carried the
naming convention of the series to a logical end.
Doesn't this sound great: Heretic, Hexen, Hecatomb?
Heretic, Hexen, Hexen 2.  Whatever. :(


April 2, 1997
------------------------------------------------
That was a great April Fool's joke yesterday, eh?
No WAY is Onethumb working here! HA HA HA HA HA!


April 1, 1997
------------------------------------------------
I've had a great idea for another game i'd like
to develop and i've asked OneThumb, who is a
great idea guy, to head up the project with me
as Executive Producer.  It's in a different
genre than our other games and is going to rock!


March 31, 1997
------------------------------------------------
Went muddin' in my brand-new fly-yellow Hummer.
Scared some dudes on the Dallas Tollway, i think.


March 28, 1997
------------------------------------------------
Whoa.  I didn't feel *too* sorry for Carmack after
hearing that his F40 got tapped by a truck since
he left a massively expensive Ferrari parked outside
all day.  But after i found out the extent of the
damage and how much it will cost to fix, i now
feel pretty bad.  I would hate to have to pay for
that amount of random damage.  That does suck.


March 25, 1997
------------------------------------------------
The F40 got hit. Carma.


March 24, 1997
------------------------------------------------
The only stuff left to create are all the
artifacts.  The design doc should be done Friday.

The www-book Halcyon Days is finished. Check out

I'm gonna miss Abrash, he's a great guy and an
amazing codesmith.
