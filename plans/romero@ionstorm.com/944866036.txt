align="left">It was six short years ago, down to the hour.&nbsp; I remember
staying up the last 30 hours doing exhaustive testing before Jay Wilbur uploaded
the shareware version of DOOM to the University of Wisconsin's FTP site.&nbsp;
We couldn't get in -- too many people were sitting on the site, waiting for our
upload.&nbsp; The target directory was full of bogus files with names like
&quot;when.is.it.coming&quot; and &quot;hurry.up.id&quot;, but finally we got
the sysop to up the connect limit to 250 and we barely got in.&nbsp; After that
upload, things changed.</p>

<p
style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12; border-left: 10px none; border-top: 2px; border-bottom: 2px; padding: 0"
align="left">I remember the crazy lockup bug we had the day before -- if DOOM
sat running for too long, it would just lock up.&nbsp; Turned out to be a value
that was being incremented by the 140-tic-per-second timer function that was
wrapping around (it takes a very long time for a LONG to wrap, even at
140-tics-per-second,&nbsp; but this one was uninitialized so it took even less
time).&nbsp; So, we finished it up and sent it out, just knowing everyone would
have a lot of fun with it.&nbsp; Happy Birthday, DOOM.</p>

align="left">I forgot to mention three birthdays in the past few months, the
birthdays of Spear of Destiny (Wolfenstein retail) on September 18th (7 years
old), DOOM II on October 10th (5 years old) and Hexen on October 31st (4 years
old).&nbsp; Got about three more birthdays coming up this month, too!&nbsp; And
one new arrival in the next couple weeks... :)</p>

beautiful and polished game I've ever seen.</p>
