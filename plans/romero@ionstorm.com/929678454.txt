align="left">Happy Birthday Wolfie!&nbsp; Seven long years ago, the shareware version of
Wolfenstein 3-D was uploaded to Software Creations BBS.&nbsp; It was very late at night
(in fact, i think it was 5am) and all our exhaustive testing was done, so we uploaded the
final ZIP file and crashed.&nbsp; Scott Miller and Bobby Prince were there for the
shareware upload since they were just as excited about Wolfie as everyone else.&nbsp; </p>

align="left">We were running id out of a 1-bedroom loft apartment in Mesquite (La Prada
Club) and the company had a grand total of 6 employees: Tom Hall, John Carmack, Adrian
Carmack, Jay Wilbur, Kevin Cloud and myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next couple months were spent
finishing the last 3 episodes (6 in total) and Tom, Kevin and I wrote the Wolfenstein 3-D
Hint Book using NeXT hardware for layout.&nbsp; That was the first and only hint book id
would ever write.&nbsp; Things got *very* busy after that point...</p>

align="left">Oh my god Andrew, I'm gonna have to DESTROY YOU!!!!&nbsp; Heh heh... great
plan update and i agree with you... there's too much sniping out there in .plan land, the
press, and <strong>especially those damned messageboards!</strong>&nbsp; Really, we're all
making games because they're FUN -- not because it's great to be deeply immersed in the
politics of a company, providing grist for the rumor mill and plotting the demise of your
fellow co-worker.&nbsp; It's all about fun stuff.&nbsp; You know: killing things with
large weapons.&nbsp; :)</p>

align="left">When i did that interview, i don't believe i was that destructive in
explaining the demo.&nbsp; I was telling the guy that most of what you see in the demo was
done by the new team.&nbsp; The E1DM1 map is originally created, the basic textures are
Andy Changs and the new special textures are from the new team.&nbsp; The E1DM2 map was
constructed from pieces of Dabug's DM map with lots more work done on it.&nbsp; All the
powerups, weapons, sound effects, multiplayer stuff, menu, etc etc etc was all done by the
new team from scratch or they tweaked old stuff.&nbsp; They did a great job in a very
short amount of time and i'm very proud of these guys.&nbsp; It's fun working with a
hardcore team.</p>

align="left">The modem interpolation bug was fixed just a couple hours ago.&nbsp; We're
finishing off some remaining polish and sending it off to MPlayer for their final testing
phase.&nbsp; We will be releasing the demo in the Practice Area of MPlayer first (limited
release), then into the Tournament Area when Practice is through with their testing.
&nbsp; When it gets into the Tournament Area, everyone can download it and try it out.</p>

align="left">About a month or so later, we will put up the Internet Deathmatch Demo
release so you can play over LAN as well and start up your own servers.&nbsp; Just
remember: this demo is only for the first episode of Daikatana's deathmatch.&nbsp; Each of
the remaining 3 episodes have their own different deathmatch feel because the weapons are
all different.&nbsp; It's like 4 deathmatch games in one.&nbsp; (And one single-player
game in one. :)</p>

likes it.&nbsp; Sure, it's taken us a little longer to get polished, but it will be worth
the wait.&nbsp; No use releasing a shab demo.</p>

James Grote's &quot;Quantum Rage: Songs for Deathmatch&quot; is -- you don't even need to
play this CD while deathmatching; I listen to it all the time in my car.&nbsp; Get this CD
if you are into metal or into doomy-melodic guitar riffs!&nbsp; Samples are available on
his site....check 'em out.</p>

align="left">Also, one of the cool features of Daikatana Deathmatch is that, depending on
the number of maxplayers your server is set for, the map can open up new areas or keep
them closed off.&nbsp; If you want your DM map to be scalable for 1-4 players, you just
put in a special wall that blocks off access to the other areas if maxplayers = 4. &nbsp;
Likewise for the other maxplayer levels (8, 16 and 32).&nbsp; This allows DM mappers to
create one single map that is good for 2 players to 32 players!&nbsp; You'll see this
feature in our Daikatana Deathmatch Demo...</p>
