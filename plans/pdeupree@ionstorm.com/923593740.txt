Spam sucks (and I'm not talking about that chopped pig parts stuff in a can
that Monty Python sings about).

Now that I've vented that one, Anachronox is kicking ass these days.  We're
getting some cool things in the game that will help both the gameplay and
the visual appearance of the game.  In addition, I've just gotten the first
run at using DirectMusic in the game.  I'm looking forward to having interactive
music in this game.  I was pretty impressed when I was playing Banjo Kazooie on
the N64 and I would hear a slow transition in the music when I got near this
pirate ship in the middle of the "level".  Little things like that can really
affect the atmosphere of a game.

I keep thinking about movies like Blade Runner and Last Temptation of Christ
where the music was so subtle, but yet I think it had a direct effect on the
mood of the movie.  Here's hoping we can achive the same thing.  ;)
