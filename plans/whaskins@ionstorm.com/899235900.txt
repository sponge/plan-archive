Today was Noel "Shadow" Stephens' last day at ION Storm.  I know I speak for the entire web team when I say that he will be greatly missed.  In other news, Daikatana.com is getting great reviews, and I'd like to thank everyone who has emailed kind words about it.  We will be constantly adding more news and information to the site, so check back often.  Today, we will be adding a downloadable song from Daikatana called Plague Village. Will Loconto is doing a great job on the music for all the games and I know gamers will be surprised by the cohesive quality and great composition of the tunes.  That's it for now.  Later.

After much hard work on the part of Noel Stephens, Dave Cash, and Bill Nadalini, www.daikatana.com is now online.  We'll be posting daily news in addition to providing the most comprehensive look at Daikatana on the Web.  Speaking of Web stuff, ION Storm is on the lookout for a top-notch web guy.  If you think you have what we're looking for drop me an email and tell me about yourself.  And don't forget, the July edition of the Eye On Storm newsletter will be posted next week.

This week marked the retirement of Stormtroopers webmaster Zep, who moves on, no doubt, to better things.  I'll miss him, as much for his smart-ass sense of humor and journalistic sense of adventure as for anything else.  So long, Zeppo.
