Ah well, so that silly symetry question is now about as clear to me as anything could possibly be: Balance, functional redundancy, efficient genetic coding, attraction of the opposite sex, and ofcourse the fact that we would look really silly hopping around from place to place on one leg.

Funny thing though, I got almost as many responses to that one as to the editor/script/GUI question. What does this say about the relative priorities of these two eternal questions?

Ah well, got this in the mail today:
>Subject: FW: Memo to you regarding Y2k...the year 2000 computer glitch
>
>This memo is to announce the development of a new software system which 
>will be Year 2000 compliant.  This
>program is known as  "Millennia  Year Application Software System" 
>(MYASS).
>
>Next Monday there will be a meeting in which I will show MYASS to 
>everyone.  We will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all 
>employees will have an opportunity to
>get a good look at MYASS. 
>We have not addressed networking aspects yet, so currently only one 
>person at a time can use MYASS.
>This restriction will be removed after MYASS expands.
>Some employees have begun using the program already. This morning I 
>walked into a subordinate's office and
>was not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS.  Some of 
>the less technical people may be
>somewhat afraid of MYASS.  Last week my secretary said to me, "I'm a 
>little nervous, I never put anything in
>MYASS before."  I helped her through the first time and afterward she 
>admitted that it was relatively painless
>and she was actually looking forward to doing it again, and was even 
>ready to kiss MYASS.
>There have been concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon 
>initial installation, but the virus has
>been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS.  
>In the future, however, protection will be required prior to entering 
>MYASS.  This database will encompass all
>information associated with the business.  As you begin using the 
>program, feel free to put anything you want in
>MYASS.
>As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace 
>for a supervisor to hand work to an employee and say, "here, stick this 
>in
>MYASS."
>It will be a great day when we need data quickly and our employees can
>respond, "Here it is, I just pulled it out of MYASS."
