In response to yesterday's nonsense:
  "What is the sound of one mapper mapping?"

Well, typically a Zen riddle has no answer. However, seeing as how this was a
poor caricature of such, a very apt solution to this immutable problem has
been received by yours truly. I quote:

> Well it obviously has to be lots of sounds.. like.. rustling of paper,
> drinking sounds, occasional burps (After especially long drinkin-
> sound), cursing (When ever the mapping software crashes) and
> last but not least, the sound a mouse makes when its rolled around
> its little mat plus some keyboard pressing sounds when mapper is
> using shortcuts.
>
> After the mapping is done and the compile process is over (If the
> game the map is built supports compilin) you can hear a big and
> long satisfaction sound... like "AAAAAAaAAaaaaaahhhhhhhh.."
> Unless the map has a leak, in which case you would hear a big and
> long "AAAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHHHHH!!"

Oh well, fnord...
