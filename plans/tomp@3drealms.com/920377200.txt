Thanks all for the feedback on the editor/scripting thingy. Sorta solidifies in my mind some lower level crap I've been messing around with here.

And now that I've used up my quota of seriousness for the month, a completely silly and irrelevant question:

Why are almost all (if not all, I can't think of a single example that isn't) animals symmetrical? What evolutionary advantage is there in this?
