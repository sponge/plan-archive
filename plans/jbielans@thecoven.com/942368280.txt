Plan:
Forgive any and all sarcasm/rudeness. I haven't gotten a lot of sleep lately.

Well, I think I came to the verdict that my previous update was a stupid question to ask. Considering what I wrote, the responses (a total of 4 I believe) were pretty good. In the sake of courtesy, I will not print the name and e-mail of those who responded

"As for hammering out a badass Q3 mod..."

"So in answer to your originally questions, yes if the mod is good (which it hopefully would be) but no if the mod is crap."

My first mistake in the .plan update. I shouldn't have automatically assumed it would be "bad ass". Of course most people would like a mod if it was "bad ass". My real point in saying that was "Do people know the Coven well enough to take note JUST for releasing the mod". Terrible wording on my part.

"Since you have .plan files right up there with id Software, Raven, Dynamix, etc.; it seems that The Coven is a mod group who tries to compete with commercial games.  Kinda makes you raise an eyebrow."

hehe. Competition is hardly an issue when compared to these companies. If we were dealing with making mods for all/many of these companies or had made our OWN games, this would be an issue. To date, however, we have only made mods for Id's products, pinning us at the heels of these companies. Not much of a competition to these guys. I'd say we're closer to competing with Evolve and Endor Productions (both groups of excellent designers, from what I've seen).

"What a stupid question, you must be feeling really down if you're wondering things like that :( Ofcourse people care if its good and you know how to market it."

True. The question in and of itself says very little for my self-worth. More inaccurate wording on my part.

"Have you though of inviting some gaming magazines to do articles?"

Numerous times. The problem is this: Why would a magazine care if the public doesn't care. We have, in fact, approached numerous magazines about our past products, and got about a page of mention about Disposable Heroes in a UK magazine. However, magazines (in my belief) have no obligation to take note of something the public already hasn't. In this case, we'd done (IMO) a good job, and a lot of OTHER places took note...but the public didn't care, expecially since it was a cheap lot of Mods that was about a year late in the making.

"Or maybe you could sell your products to the magazines so they had something to publish on their cover cd's."

Sold an OEM version of DH for a few hundred to a magazine. They put it on a cover disk. OOoopsy! No additional profit generated! :)

"I'm not trying to be rude or anything.  It's just that most of us are
wondering when we'll see commercial product come from your doors."

2, as a matter of fact. Disposable Heroes, a google of mods and skins for Quake and Quake 2 and Deadlode2, a damn good Q2 teamplay mod, focusing on realistics in physics and weapons. In addition to that, Deadlode 2 is extremely modifiable for any server. I don't think thats really what you meant though. If, when you said commercial, you meant a product on the shelves of Best Buy with "The Coven" and a distributing company logo stamped on the cover than, well, I dunno what to say. I'll try and save this .plan update in the hopes that one of you who responded buys a Coven product and write an e-mail saying something like "Woah! You guys, like, came out of nowhere!" Doubtful it should happen, but can't one dream? :)

Anyway, my verdict is far from final, and I hope that the day should come that I can write coveted .plan's, like Id and such.
