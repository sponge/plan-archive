May 19. 

An old blind man dressed in rags appeared to me in my dreams las night.
"Beware the ides of May!" he wept in a voice that sent chills right down
my spine. I think I know what he meant. Needless to say I woke up
screaming "But, Dave, I had *all* of my work ready for the Demo 3 days
ago! I swear I really did!!!". Nightmares. Gotta love 'em.

If you have fingered carly@crack.com and/or trey@crack.com you have
probably read their reflections on the funny story involving Trey, the
toilet and some logs. Well, it's all a crock. Nobody really called a
plumber. We simply flushed Trey and fished him out of the local sewage two
hours later. 

o I have finished two pieces of music last week. "Industry Standard" and
  "Floyd". The latter is now featured as an 'Exclusive Soundtrack preview'
  piece on "The Golgotha COnneciotn" fan web page, located at
  http://games.3dreview.com/golgotha

o Did some PR work on the IRC. Got the 3DReview guys talking to us again.
  Made him change "The Golgotha Conneciton" logo as the previous (now
  gone)version of it sported large pink & gold disco letters. Very disturbing.

o Made a short (33 seconds) piece of music for Carly. Nothing big. Just an
  ambient piece for testing purposes. Carly is editing movies. And stuff.

o Got my Apple Newton Message Pad 120 (god bless Manda Dee for letting me
  have this ever-so-slightly-expencive palmtop) and fixed it to suit my
  work needs. It now records, saves and transmits MIDI files and holds my
  office records togather. yes, i admit, Apple did come out with a neat
  product. Just this once. 

Sadly, I am *not* attending E3 this year. have a few minor complicaitons.
Which is ok, since I will be watching all the webcasts and the guys
promissed to bring em many happy free stuffs form the show. Come see
"Golgotha" there. Stalk Dave until he shows you. Or something.
 
Included below is the encrypted version of the stuff I can't really tell
you about:

May 12.

Desperately Seeking Paycheck. *g*

Today I will work on the new piece of music tentaitvely called "Industry 
Standard". I might end up reheashing sound  effects all in the same day. 
Deadlines loom.

--= DAILY NUGGET OF JOY =--
