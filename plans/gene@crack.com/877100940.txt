Friday, October 17, 1997	|      11:48am
--------------------------------------------------------------

'Tis very quiet at the office today...
Perhaps too quiet. Programmers must have fallen deep into the
Post-Deadline-Crunch Hybernaiton, cluttered in warm little balls
at the bottoms of their freshly spun coccoons. Freaky.

There is not much to tlka about aside for the fact that our game
rocks. No, really. You ought to trust me on that one. It is a real
challenge to work on a game for over a year and - s t i l l - think
that it is very cool. We are damned proud of our work. Music is nice
too.

Speaking of music - here is your chance to earn yourselves some phat
Carly Points! Yes, you heard it right - glorious 15 points will be
awarded to the *FIRST* person to come up with the most clever, witty
and snazzy name for the piece of music originally created for the game.
This piece of music fell under the knife, ending up in the 'Director's
Cut' isle. Still, it is a masterpiece of it's own proportions and needs
a worthy name. To request the music piece (in mp3 format, about 2MB), 
please e-mail me at gene@crack.com. Ask and ye shall recieve. I might
also stick it on my work web page
(http://www.crack.com/about/gene/gene.html). So check there first.

That would be it for today. Now I must go work and anticipate the
incredible 'Vampire: The Masquerade' live aciotn game that I am to run
tonight. I get to make people suffer. Yummy.

Holly mother of pearl! Several months without a decent .plan
update! Here goes nothing...

The game is shaping up, like a beautiful woman. No, seriously, it is
actually interesting and fun to watch and/or play. I love what the 
coders added to it since the last demo. 'Golgotha' will dominate,
rule on high and other related stuff...

Since my last glorious plan update, I have worked hard on the overall
Action Score, bringing the soundtrack to about 70% complete.

I have also worked on the ambient sounds to be used as the 'Sound Objects'
within the game. A few, but they really do add to the overall
atmosphere...  In the process of the above I learned to utterly despise
oil pumps. 'Nuff said.

What else... A few really good articles about the videogame music have
graced the Gameing related pereodicals past month. Many interviewed
musicians defended the glory and honor of the game music. Amen to that.
Which brings me to another point - some musicians are pointlessly lucky.
No, seriously, while hard working talented composers are condemned to
quasi-permanent low-budget "make-it-yourself-or-loose" working conditions,
lucky few get chances to build dream recording studios and waste
buckage-galore on equipment, never to justify their spendings by quality
work output... Maybe I'm just bitter.

Oh yes, when you play the Demo, do me a faovr and drop me a note with your
comments on music and sound deisgn: gene@crack.com. I need thy input!

- Captain out... Cold.

Wow... E3... And all that stuff... 

Looking back at the amount of work we have put into our demo
I can predict that it will turn heads. If you ever dreamed
of blasting semi-intelligent pre-alpha enemy units whilest 
evil clown music blasts your ear drums with the 'carnival
ride' dementia - come to the Diamond booth and take the
Super Tank for a spin. 

To recap our pre E3 horror... You know you worked too long
and too much if and when you start discussing the orange
juice bottle forskins, lame-ass muffins and Trey. I worked 
my 28 hours straight, got buned out and left to slumber
as Dave, Carly and Trey still remained, cranking on the 
Game-wonder. 

The music for the engine movie was written in the record.
I was --= REALLY =-- scared that it would suck. But now
that I listen to it again - it's quite allright. Hope all
you E3-going 'Golgotha' fans will enjoy it.

Carly's dialogue rocks beyond belief. It's funny, fer reals.

I am horrified to think of how much else will be sacrificed 
to bring you this game, yet, somehow, I know it will be all 
worth it and, in the end, we will gain immortality through
lack of sleep and life deprivation...

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
|SOME STUFF THAT GOT DONE DURING THE E3 RUSH:
`````````````````````````````````````````````  

o 'Red Day Remix' of the 'Golgotha' theme song. Campy.
o 'First Engine Movie' Soundtrack. You'll hear it at E3.
o 'Clown Smash!' Frst (Traning) Level ambient. Scary.
o 'Underscore' study and composition. Underscores are Satan.
o 'Requiem' music piece. Might make it into the game.
o  Strange miscellaneous discarded music. Blech.
o  Voice recording mixing and SFX editing. Done, boxed, shipped.

2 DAYS WORTH OF SLEEP HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE MAKING OF THIS GAME

NO PROGRAMMERS HAVE BEEN HURT DURING THE PRODUCTION

LONG LIVE THE JOLT!

May 19. 

An old blind man dressed in rags appeared to me in my dreams las night.
"Beware the ides of May!" he wept in a voice that sent chills right down
my spine. I think I know what he meant. Needless to say I woke up
screaming "But, Dave, I had *all* of my work ready for the Demo 3 days
ago! I swear I really did!!!". Nightmares. Gotta love 'em.

If you have fingered carly@crack.com and/or trey@crack.com you have
probably read their reflections on the funny story involving Trey, the
toilet and some logs. Well, it's all a crock. Nobody really called a
plumber. We simply flushed Trey and fished him out of the local sewage two
hours later. 

o I have finished two pieces of music last week. "Industry Standard" and
  "Floyd". The latter is now featured as an 'Exclusive Soundtrack preview'
  piece on "The Golgotha COnneciotn" fan web page, located at
  http://games.3dreview.com/golgotha

o Did some PR work on the IRC. Got the 3DReview guys talking to us again.
  Made him change "The Golgotha Conneciton" logo as the previous (now
  gone)version of it sported large pink & gold disco letters. Very disturbing.

o Made a short (33 seconds) piece of music for Carly. Nothing big. Just an
  ambient piece for testing purposes. Carly is editing movies. And stuff.

o Got my Apple Newton Message Pad 120 (god bless Manda Dee for letting me
  have this ever-so-slightly-expencive palmtop) and fixed it to suit my
  work needs. It now records, saves and transmits MIDI files and holds my
  office records togather. yes, i admit, Apple did come out with a neat
  product. Just this once. 

Sadly, I am *not* attending E3 this year. have a few minor complicaitons.
Which is ok, since I will be watching all the webcasts and the guys
promissed to bring em many happy free stuffs form the show. Come see
"Golgotha" there. Stalk Dave until he shows you. Or something.

May 12.

Desperately Seeking Paycheck. *g*

Today I will work on the new piece of music tentaitvely called "Industry 
Standard". I might end up reheashing sound  effects all in the same day. 
Deadlines loom.
