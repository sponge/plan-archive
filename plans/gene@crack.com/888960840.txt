Hi guys and gals!

I am hereby declaring a Casting Call for the parts of the main and
miscellaneous characters in our game. you don't need to be a professional
actor (although acting experience is a plus) and I will give preference to
locals and people able to attend an audition in our office. However, those
of you who live outside of Texas can also apply.

Here are the guidelines of how to do it and what to submit:

1. Send me a vocie sample of you talking in normal voice and you tlaking
in whatever vocies and/or accents you can pull off. 

2. Each file should be unter 2MB in size.

3. Each file should be 44KHz, 16Bit Stereo (mono is OK as well)

4. Content of the voice samples is irrelevant. Say whatever you want to.
however, soemthing militaristic or war-appropriate will be a big plus.

5. Please use a Spit Screen (or just hold a piece of paper between your
mouth and the mike to avoid the horrible 'Ssss' and 'Phhh' sounds)

6. Please save the file as Windows PCM (*.wav) file (aka 'wave')

7. I would prefer it if you would use CoolEdit Pro however, it is ok to
use whatever you have at the moment.

This casting call / audition will be conducted from the day this message
is posted on my .plan until May 01, 1998.



IF YOU GET CHOSEN FOR ONE OF OUR PARTS:

You will recieve full credit in our game manual Credits section and a
mention / link to you on our Web Site. 

There might be some other things in store for you from Captain Dave, but
we won't talk about it until the time you get chosen for the part, ok?

IMPORTANT: Please do not send any material that involves
pointless profanity or unnescessary mature content. Keep it clean. Well,
to the point *grin*


NEWS FLASH: Carly just called me and told me not to offer any Carly Points
for Auditions and the likes due to the fact that she is no longer part of
Crack dot Com's development team and, therefore, CPs are no longer related
to anything we do here. Go figure. Well, I know I cna not compete with the
popularity of Carly Points, but I still want to offer some kind of
collectable incentive for your efforts - so here it is:

I will give away compeltely Crack dot Com related Borshcht Points for this
and other possible contests and puzzles I might throw your way. These
points are totally related to all and every thing we do here at Cracka dn
will be redeamable for things like a possible 'Golgotha' Soundtrack CD
(hey, it might happen! =) perhaps a copy of our game ro something neat
like that. 

So here it is:

Submitting an Audition sound file..............  10 Borshcht Points (BPs)
Being Selected For The Character Part..........  50 Borshcht Points (BPs)
Completing The Voice Talent Project............ 100 Borshcht Points (BPs)

GET THEM WHILE THEY'RE HOT !!!

Let The Auditions Begin!

As you have probably heard form Carly Central HQ, I am
holding a contest to award 150 Carly Points. Provided below
are the terms of the contest:

You have to submit one or severla Bagpipe sounds in *.wav
format. 

The sample *MUST* be originally recorded in 44.1 KHz,
16Bit MONO. (Upsampling,say, a 11KHz 8Bit wave file  will not do) 

The sample must *NOT* exceed the size of 1MB 

The sample should be either a short finite passage played by the
Bagpipes or a singular note (base or treble)

Try to avoid the 'Riverdance' and 'Bravehart' =) I have enough of 
the unusable copyrighted stuff =)

You must submit a supplementary note stating that you are providing
this sound file royalty-free for unlimited use by Crack dot Com, Inc.
and Gene M. Rozenberg.

-------------------------------------------------- Over >>> ----------

All of the above yields 100 Carly Points to the author of the 
file submission. Additional 50 Carly Points may be recieved if:


The sample is an original and was not recorded form a Copyrighted source
of *ANY* kind (Yes, this means that you recorded someone blow a bagpipe 
a lot or something =) . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  25 CPts.

You include an entire set of 7 notes played by a bagpipe (total size of
all the samples is still =< 1MB) . . . . . . . . . 10 CPts.

Yous submit the Bagpipe sample as a *.SBK or *.SF or *.SF2 (SoudBank or
SoundFont, or SoundFont2 format, already usable by AWE32/64 soundcard
family) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  10 CPts.

The Bagpipes sample consist of *JUST* the Bagpipes and no other
instruments. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 05 CPts.


Well, there you go. the deadline for Submission is 12:00am January 8th.
Do not forget to send all the submissions to gene@crack.com .
Carly would appreciate it if you would not CC any of that to her.
She could care less for overabundance of Bagpipeage at the moment
=) Ready... Set.... Goferit!

Crap on a stick! Another month without an update...

What to tell you all... More music for the game have been composed
I am now 4 mere pieces away form the completion of the action level
soundtrack. Joy to the world or something.

Stuff in the family make me leave the office for a week and fly
back to Indianapolis for an entire week. I am taking my keyboard
with me to work there...

Worked on sound effects today. Got all of them looping seemlessly.
Can not find the Fog Horn/Siren sound anywhere however (emulating
it just doesn't sound right). So 100 Carly Points to the first person
to send me the *BEST* Fog Horn (lighthouse fog alarm) SFX. The sound
should be 44.1KHz 16-bit Stereo. Any Fog Horn enthusiasts out there?

Our game is looking damned sexy. It even runs fast. Now all I need for
total happiness is to get over this stupid Composer's Block...

More later -  Captain Out (cold)

'Tis very quiet at the office today...
Perhaps too quiet. Programmers must have fallen deep into the
Post-Deadline-Crunch Hybernaiton, cluttered in warm little balls
at the bottoms of their freshly spun coccoons. Freaky.

There is not much to tlka about aside for the fact that our game
rocks. No, really. You ought to trust me on that one. It is a real
challenge to work on a game for over a year and - s t i l l - think
that it is very cool. We are damned proud of our work. Music is nice
too.

Speaking of music - here is your chance to earn yourselves some phat
Carly Points! Yes, you heard it right - glorious 15 points will be
awarded to the *FIRST* person to come up with the most clever, witty
and snazzy name for the piece of music originally created for the game.
This piece of music fell under the knife, ending up in the 'Director's
Cut' isle. Still, it is a masterpiece of it's own proportions and needs
a worthy name. To request the music piece (in mp3 format, about 2MB), 
please e-mail me at gene@crack.com. Ask and ye shall recieve. I might
also stick it on my work web page
(http://www.crack.com/about/gene/gene.html). So check there first.

That would be it for today. Now I must go work and anticipate the
incredible 'Vampire: The Masquerade' live aciotn game that I am to run
tonight. I get to make people suffer. Yummy.

- Gene

Holly mother of pearl! Several months without a decent .plan
update! Here goes nothing...

The game is shaping up, like a beautiful woman. No, seriously, it is
actually interesting and fun to watch and/or play. I love what the 
coders added to it since the last demo. 'Golgotha' will dominate,
rule on high and other related stuff...

Since my last glorious plan update, I have worked hard on the overall
Action Score, bringing the soundtrack to about 70% complete.

I have also worked on the ambient sounds to be used as the 'Sound Objects'
within the game. A few, but they really do add to the overall
atmosphere...  In the process of the above I learned to utterly despise
oil pumps. 'Nuff said.

What else... A few really good articles about the videogame music have
graced the Gameing related pereodicals past month. Many interviewed
musicians defended the glory and honor of the game music. Amen to that.
Which brings me to another point - some musicians are pointlessly lucky.
No, seriously, while hard working talented composers are condemned to
quasi-permanent low-budget "make-it-yourself-or-loose" working conditions,
lucky few get chances to build dream recording studios and waste
buckage-galore on equipment, never to justify their spendings by quality
work output... Maybe I'm just bitter.

Oh yes, when you play the Demo, do me a faovr and drop me a note with your
comments on music and sound deisgn: gene@crack.com. I need thy input!

- Captain out... Cold.

Wow... E3... And all that stuff... 

Looking back at the amount of work we have put into our demo
I can predict that it will turn heads. If you ever dreamed
of blasting semi-intelligent pre-alpha enemy units whilest 
evil clown music blasts your ear drums with the 'carnival
ride' dementia - come to the Diamond booth and take the
Super Tank for a spin. 

To recap our pre E3 horror... You know you worked too long
and too much if and when you start discussing the orange
juice bottle forskins, lame-ass muffins and Trey. I worked 
my 28 hours straight, got buned out and left to slumber
as Dave, Carly and Trey still remained, cranking on the 
Game-wonder. 

The music for the engine movie was written in the record.
I was --= REALLY =-- scared that it would suck. But now
that I listen to it again - it's quite allright. Hope all
you E3-going 'Golgotha' fans will enjoy it.

Carly's dialogue rocks beyond belief. It's funny, fer reals.

I am horrified to think of how much else will be sacrificed 
to bring you this game, yet, somehow, I know it will be all 
worth it and, in the end, we will gain immortality through
lack of sleep and life deprivation...

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
|SOME STUFF THAT GOT DONE DURING THE E3 RUSH:
`````````````````````````````````````````````  

o 'Red Day Remix' of the 'Golgotha' theme song. Campy.
o 'First Engine Movie' Soundtrack. You'll hear it at E3.
o 'Clown Smash!' Frst (Traning) Level ambient. Scary.
o 'Underscore' study and composition. Underscores are Satan.
o 'Requiem' music piece. Might make it into the game.
o  Strange miscellaneous discarded music. Blech.
o  Voice recording mixing and SFX editing. Done, boxed, shipped.

2 DAYS WORTH OF SLEEP HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE MAKING OF THIS GAME

NO PROGRAMMERS HAVE BEEN HURT DURING THE PRODUCTION

LONG LIVE THE JOLT!

May 19. 

An old blind man dressed in rags appeared to me in my dreams las night.
"Beware the ides of May!" he wept in a voice that sent chills right down
my spine. I think I know what he meant. Needless to say I woke up
screaming "But, Dave, I had *all* of my work ready for the Demo 3 days
ago! I swear I really did!!!". Nightmares. Gotta love 'em.

If you have fingered carly@crack.com and/or trey@crack.com you have
probably read their reflections on the funny story involving Trey, the
toilet and some logs. Well, it's all a crock. Nobody really called a
plumber. We simply flushed Trey and fished him out of the local sewage two
hours later. 

o I have finished two pieces of music last week. "Industry Standard" and
  "Floyd". The latter is now featured as an 'Exclusive Soundtrack preview'
  piece on "The Golgotha COnneciotn
