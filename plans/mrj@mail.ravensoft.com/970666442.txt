Well it has been a horribly busy week and looks like it
will be more of the same in the near future. Aside from the
work I'm doing on ***(can't say)***, I've had school board
and PTCA meetings all week in the evenings, and I'm helping
set up (more meetings) the PTCA for the new school they're
putting up in my neighborhood, as well as dealing with city
and school district planners who all have different agendas
for "what we need to do with the new school". Then there's
dentist appointments (I don't even remember what they're 
doing this time) and I missed a symphony and a musical
because I couldn't see the reminders on my calender becuase
it was so full. Somewhere in the last week I had a birthday,
I think it was Monday...

And people wonder about my obsession with single malt :)
