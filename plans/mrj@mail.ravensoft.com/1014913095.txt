Well, today is my last day here at Raven. It's hard
to imagine that almost nine years of being in the same
place, working with the same familiar faces on 
all the great products we've made is about to come
to an end. I am definitely looking forward with great
excitement to working at Destineer, and I think the
move to Minneapolis will prove to be a good one for
myself and my family. Still, it's hard to leave a 
job and company you love for something untested,
and no matter how great things are at Destineer,
I'm sure I will always remember Raven as the place
that first convinced me that it's possible to have 
a job that I really enjoyed almost every single day.

Thanks to Raven, thanks to the people I work with,
and thanks to the people out there who helped make the 
ride a fun one.

As Ah-nold says: "I'll be back". Just a different title
at the end of the sig now ;)
