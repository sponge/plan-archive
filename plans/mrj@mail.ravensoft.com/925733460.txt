Well I read both Bob and Kenn's latest .plan file updates, must say they 
both strain the limits of my credulity. As for Kenn's claim that his 
sister got the Boardwalk Monopoly piece and threw it away without knowing
what it was, all I can say is "Yeah, right!" We all know that no one in
Kenn's family would ever do something like that, he or she is obviously 
making the whole episode up. A more likely scenario, what I think REALLY
happened, is that she got the Boardwalk piece, and said "How can I turn
this to the service of the Evil Master, Bob Love? I know, I'll throw the 
piece away, claiming not to know what it was! That will not only provide
a nice little story for my brother, Kenn, He Who Is Slightly Less Evil 
Than Bob. It will also screw up the whole McDonald's prize scheme, because
no one will win and therefor the whole world will believe that the entire
game was a hoax! Aaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahah!" she then probably burned the
game piece in a ritual sacrifice, dedicating the chaos and destruction 
it would bring to furthering Bob Love's insidious plans to rule the world
by making us believe that everything we see is fake. After all, who do
you think is responsible for pro wrestling? Bob Love, that's who! Oh,
the humanity!

And now a brief note about Bob Love's own .plan file. Ptpptpttptpt!
And yes, I am much better now, thank you.

Ha. Haha. Aaaahahahahahahaaaaa! Wheeeeeeeeeee! Oh damn, here we go again...
