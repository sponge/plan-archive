Wow, I guess I should admit to being killed or beaten up more often, I've
already gotten a reply from yesterday's post, from Asmodean (one of the
guys I mentioned). Well, all I can say is that while I am FAR from being
one of the best players here at Raven (yesterday's "test" DM was another
chance for me to be humiliated by some of the guys here), I am still pretty
good compared to the average. So, anyone who can tromp me regularly needs
to be exchanging blades with some of the other people here as well.

A couple other notes -- many of the guys here who regularly beat the crap
out of me were once themselves my spanking toys. When people first start 
working here, we like to show them how far down the totem they are by
pretty much forcing them to DM with us and get totally humiliated. And 
since they really want to fit in, and keep their jobs, they do just that.
Unfortuntely, for many of them it just gives them an incentive to keep 
playing and playing until they get REALLY REALLY good and then they come
back (ungrateful bastards that they are) and kick the snot out of their
teachers. Kind of like if the Karate Kid put Mr. Miyagi in the hospital
by way of saying "Thanks, you taught me everything I know, now kiss my
ass!" So, when spanking other people, remember that one day they may 
be the ones with the big ol' paddle in their hands.

Second and last (for today) note. Asmodean commented (and I have heard 
other people do so as well) that I seem to teleport away a lot. Well, 
yes, I do. And I usually live to tell about it afterwards. I have become
quite adept at releasing a phoenix and then saying "bye" with a little
green flash. It worked in Heretic, it worked in Hexens I and II, and it
works now. I live, I kill, I get away safe. If you don't like it, come up
with some way around it. The guys here have no problem with it.

OK, it's been awhile since I last updated this, just had to say
something about how much fun I've been having doing Heretic2 DM over 
the net lately. The most fun thing is that there are quite a number of 
people out there who pretty regularly KICK MY ASS when I run into them
online. Now, I'm used to this happening with people here at Raven, where
obviously a lot of people have played a lot of Heretic2 and are therefor
very very good, but the great thing about people out THERE being so good
is that it means some peole are playing a lot out there as well, and
that's very good news for us. Of course, the "bulk" of players out there
are just so much blade- or phoenix- fodder for us Ravenites, but it
is refreshing to know that sometimes when I meet up with some crazed 
fanatic, I'm meeting someone as good as or better than myself! It makes 
the game very much worthwhile. Best of all perhaps is when we are about
evenly matched, (like a game I played a few minutes ago where "Timmy" 
and "Asmodean" were pretty much keeping me hopping), and the lead goes 
back and forth and sometimes from map to map.

So, to all those people out there keeping me humble -- I salute you!
Too all those who still have a ways to go before Chorizo fears you --
Play Better!

PS -- I think I'll make a list of the people who have seriously beaten
me or at least kept pace, starting with Timmy and Asmodean only because 
they are recent and haven't been dumped from memory yet.

Back from Europe (actually got back last Thursday) and everything was
great! The press and buyers over there are really excited about the 
game, I'm sure that if the public (including the public here in the US) 
responds in kind that Heretic II will be our biggest game ever. It is so 
great to work on a game that everyone is so pumped about -- press,
buyers, producers, everyone here at Raven, (almost) all the public 
response as well. There may be a few die-hard never-buy-a-3rd-person-game
players out there, but then we never expected the game to run on a 386
anyway ;)

Back to the salt (Ogle) mines!

Off to Europe tomorrow, just finished tying up the last few loose end on
my levels. Hopefully, by the time I get back, everything will be done...

Damn, this game is looking good!

Well, have not updated this for some time... just lazy I guess, or as
someone I know once said, "I've got REAL things to do." Anyway.

Next week (actually this weekend) I am heading off to Europe for a press
tour -- France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and UK. It is going to be a
blast I'm sure, everyone (including me) is really hyped about how great
Heretic II is looking. Who knows, I may even come back with more dumb 
American stories about travel abroad. Hope not, since probably most of
the Americans I'll probably meet over there are Activision people...

The best thing is, I hope, that by the time I get back, Heretic II will
be tucked neatly into its little CD bed and ready to ship. I can hardly 
wait to play it, myself :) 














That was a joke. Jeez, what you people will believe.
