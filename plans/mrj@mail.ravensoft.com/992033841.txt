Well tomorrow it's off to London and Ireland for two weeks
of (I hope) fun and relative rest. I've got a checklist
to make sure I don't forget anything:

1) track down the Queen and give her a big sloppy kiss
2) hijack a double-decker bus and teach those people over
   there how to drive on the right side of the street!
3) annex Northern Ireland as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
   Activision (the Brits don't really want it and the Irish
   will be glad of a regular paycheck)
4) teach my daughter to drink Guinness for breakfast every
   morning
5) find the person who thought up eating kippers for breakfast
   (or any other time for that matter) and beat them to a pulp
6) come back with an outrageous Cockney accent to annoy 
   all the people here at work

I know it's a full schedule, but I think I can do it!
