Well, I guess it's official. Today a representative of the Computer Games
Paleontological Society sent me notice that from this date forward I will
be viewed as a "relic". Yes, it was an amazing SIX YEARS AGO today that
I started working at Raven Software. As indication of the vast temporal
span which has passed since I began working here, consider the following:

When I first started working at Raven...

 1. We were just UPGRADING to 386's. I was really pleased that I got a 14"
    monitor instead of one of the old 13" ones.
 2. Wolfenstein was still a new game.
 3. Doom? Wasn't that the name of the sorcerer guy in that Conan movie?
 4. Microsoft shares were less than $10
 5. I still had visible hair on the top of my head. Ok on most of it. Well,
    at least part of the top of my head was covered by a few hairs combed
    in a big wave.
 6. Raven was still owned by Brian and Steve Raffel, although our souls
    were held in lien by EA/Origin.
 7. My daughter was just 2 weeks old. Good thing I was already used to 
    operating on long hours and no sleep.
 8. There were just 8 people at Raven (counting the 3 of us who started on
    the same day).
 9. We did not have internet access at work. Our LAN was pretty shaky, too.
10. RPGs were still hot, shooters were just emerging as a force, side-
    scrolling puzzle-jumpers like Prince of Persia were the rage.

Well, now that I am thoroughly depressed, it's time to go home and have a
nice bottle -- uh, I mean GLASS, yeah, glass -- of scotch. BTW, the average
price of the scotch I drank then: about $8 a bottle. Now? $50. How times
do change things :)
