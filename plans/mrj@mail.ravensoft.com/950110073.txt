Well, it seems to have taken me some time to get around to updating this
thing...

Let's see, where to start? STV:EF is moving along very well, we're now in
"pre-crunch" mode as I call it, or maybe that should be "crunch lite"?
We're going back to all the maps and adding pretties, scripts and actual
enemies, fixing architecture glitches and making sure file size stays 
reasonable. One of our programmers recently put up a build from this time
last year for us to compare with, it is truly amazing how much has been
done and how much better things look. Every day there is something new,
every day I see something that makes me (cynical jaded fellow that I am)
go "Crikey, that's amazin'!"

Aside from work, the annual visitation from Our Lady of Tax Extraction
has kept me from getting anything useful done around the house. I finally 
got the federal done (a whopping $8 return) and State is next. It is so 
nice to live where combined property and income taxes are among the 
highest in the nation...

Well, the little scream of agony from my speakers tells me another BSP is
done, time to see what I broke today.
