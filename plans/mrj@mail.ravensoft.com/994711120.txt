OK a couple of techincal issues that are bugging me:

I have an old computer on which the hard drive has croaked
(there are errors in the FAT...). Normally since I just
got a nice new machine I would just shrug and reformat- 
but of course there are a few files like my .pst file and
all my Word documents that would be nice to have (the backup
I have is not very recent). Soooooo, is there anything a lowly
non-tech like me can do to safely and (I hope) easily recover
said data? email me your thoughts.

Second issue- the aforementioned new machine came with OfficeXP
installed, despite the fact I didn't need it. I have a copy of
Office2000 (from the now dead old machine) that I think is better
(it's the Professional Edition for one thing) and besides XP
does not seem to like ZoneAlarm. Is is safe to uninstall
OfficeXP (i.e. it won't screw my nice new machine) and then
install Office2000 in its place? I assume (from past efforts
to install 98 over NT) that simply stomping on the XP version
will not work. Again email me your thoughts.

And now back to work... :(

Well, I made it back safe and (relatively) sound. Now to
wade through 278 emails and an enormous backlog of other
messages...

Well tomorrow it's off to London and Ireland for two weeks
of (I hope) fun and relative rest. I've got a checklist
to make sure I don't forget anything:

1) track down the Queen and give her a big sloppy kiss
2) hijack a double-decker bus and teach those people over
   there how to drive on the right side of the street!
3) annex Northern Ireland as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
   Activision (the Brits don't really want it and the Irish
   will be glad of a regular paycheck)
4) teach my daughter to drink Guinness for breakfast every
   morning
5) find the person who thought up eating kippers for breakfast
   (or any other time for that matter) and beat them to a pulp
6) come back with an outrageous Cockney accent to annoy 
   all the people here at work

I know it's a full schedule, but I think I can do it!
