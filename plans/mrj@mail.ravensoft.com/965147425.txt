(to the tune of "Raindrops are Fallin' on My Head")

Caffeine if screaming through my veins,
If I get another bug I think I'll go insane!
I fixed this yesterday!
Oh, I'm never gonna stop these bugs from appearing,
Until I'm dead...

Well tomorrow I take off for my first vacation in... well, in a long time!
I am heading back to Texas, where I was born many MANY moons ago. I have to
suffer a few days in Huntsville at the mother-in-law's place, then I get to
visit San Antonio for a couple days of actual fun. I might even stop in at
Fort Sam and say hi to the hospital where I was born if it has not been
torn down in shame over what they loosed on the world :)

I should get back just in time to suffer the living hell which is "The
Second Crunching"

Well, since no one responded (not one person) to my scotch challenge,
I guess I had to find something else to amuse me...

Fortunately Bob Love and Eric Biessman "suggested" the following

in their own finger files...

OK it's time for the unofficial "guess the name of the scotch"
game. I was going to make people guess from the backs of
the bottles (I think I can recognize most of them, which
is probably not a good thing) but decided that would be too
much. Sooooo, here's the pics of the bottles (empty) I 
keep on my shelf, feel free to email me with your guesses.
I know one shelf has vodka and stuff on it, ignore those!
(unless you can transtale them, that would be amusing).

Checking websites for hints is not fair :)

Well just a short break from the death march (as opposed to deathmatch,
which is usually more fun) to post some pics from our latest
DesignerCon, where those Designers who just finished SOF commiserated
with those of us just starting crunch time on Star Trek. Basically
it was just an excuse to sit around and play games, watch movies,
eat burned meat and drink large quantities of various beers. Here's 
the pics, enjoy...

Well that's it for now. Coming soon (relatively speaking): pics of my scotch
bottle collection!

Now it's back to work...

Well, it seems to have taken me some time to get around to updating this
thing...

Let's see, where to start? STV:EF is moving along very well, we're now in
"pre-crunch" mode as I call it, or maybe that should be "crunch lite"?
We're going back to all the maps and adding pretties, scripts and actual
enemies, fixing architecture glitches and making sure file size stays 
reasonable. One of our programmers recently put up a build from this time
last year for us to compare with, it is truly amazing how much has been
done and how much better things look. Every day there is something new,
every day I see something that makes me (cynical jaded fellow that I am)
go "Crikey, that's amazin'!"

Aside from work, the annual visitation from Our Lady of Tax Extraction
has kept me from getting anything useful done around the house. I finally 
got the federal done (a whopping $8 return) and State is next. It is so 
nice to live where combined property and income taxes are among the 
highest in the nation...

Well, the little scream of agony from my speakers tells me another BSP is
done, time to see what I broke today.
