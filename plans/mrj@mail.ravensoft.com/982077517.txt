Well, it has been some time since the last update. Here's a few pics
from the latest "BiessCon" at Eric Biessman's house. He seems
to have (wisely) hidden himself from the camera, and I must say the
dearth of images is probably from the fact that everyone was too
busy playing games and, er, "imbibing" to actually figure out
how the camera worked...

<a href=http://www2.ravensoft.com/users/mrj/BiessCon002.jpg>Rob has killed a LOT of brain cells, Otto seems to need help standing up</a>

<a href=http://www2.ravensoft.com/users/mrj/BiessCon006.jpg>Beans, Beer, various jalapeno-laden condiments, and sardines... Otto and Rob attempt to wipe out all life on Earth</a>

I wonder why Rob got in so many of those pictures?
