So, you think your holiday season has been bad? I 
just received this email from my father-in-law, 
describing the apocalyptic ending of the events 
which filled his pre-Christmas week, events which 
made it truly a week from hell. He was trying to 
get his house in order before coming up for the 
holidays, and there were some – well, difficulties… 
To preface his comments, I should note that my 
father-in-law, Dr. Ralph Raymond, is a professor 
of Political Science at DePauw University in 
Greencastle, Indiana (Sahu, who is mentioned in 
this email, is also a professor at DePauw). Like 
a typical absent-minded professor, his approach 
to certain types of problems is somewhat unorthodox, 
and the results in this case are pretty much par for 
his past experiences (which gives you some indication 
of how chaotic his life sometimes is). Before sending 
me this email he had indicated in several phone calls 
that he was experiencing an “infestation” of gigantic 
house flies, and despite his best efforts he was 
unable to locate where they were coming from, and 
there were so many of them he could not kill them 
fast enough to have any peace in the house. His 
first guess, that they were somehow coming from 
one of the many houseplants he had, was obviously 
incorrect since even after moving the plants to his 
basement, the flies kept coming. 
And coming. 
And coming.


And now the grand finale…

Six frantic days of searching for the source of the 
giant flies.


Solved!


The fireplace! After removing almost all my house 
plants to the tender mercies of the basement and 
chasing and spraying flies which seem to appear by 
the thousands out of nowhere, I noticed that the 
interior screen of the fireplace window was fly-
specked, and, on closer inspection, the residue 
of ashes in the bottom of the fireplace was 
literally crawling with fly larvae, emerging 
from some kind of brittle cocoon. As they matured, 
i.e., sprouting wings, they managed to crawl somehow 
around the stove door and from the ashbin underneath. 
And then they swarmed, swooped, and dived at me all 
over the house. I could run, but I couldn’t hide!

So I built a fire, thinking that would take care 
of the problem. But the flue was jammed shut, smoke 
billowed out into the living room, which already 
was heavy with insecticide I’d been spraying. And 
the floors were already covered with twisting, 
twirling, buzzing houseflies in their last, I hope, 
painful throes of death-agony. I tried and tried to 
unjam the flue so the air could be disgorged upward 
through the chimney. I pulled, twisted, wrenched and 
used colorful language at it. Then I decided it had 
rusted shut, since I’ve not used the fireplace for a 
few years.

I had at first concluded there was something dead 
in the chimney, a food source for my visitors; but 
no odor suggested that, though I had my nose into 
the stove sniffing and snuffing away as I have been 
doing from basement to attic for the past six days! 
In any case, the flies seem to be emerging, 
phoenix-like, directly from the ash sediment, so 
much so that I kept thinking of the great seal of 
the University of Chicago-the gooney-bird sitting 
on a bonfire, you know.

But with smoke belching out of the fire-place, two 
doors wide open so I could avoid the kind of 
asphyxiation I wished upon the houseflies (some of 
which foolishly tried to escape outdoors only to 
drop frozen to death in mid-flight within three feet 
of the door – baby, it’s cold outside!), I simply 
panicked and started ruffling through all of my 
appliance and electronic guarantee and warranty 
papers – a veritable library of that crap – in order 
to get Don Walton’s number in Cloverdale – the guy 
who installed the buck stove in1992.

Anyway I played the role of hysterical home owner 
(I do it very well – for me it takes little acting 
ability) and called Don and left a message for him. 
He probably thought he had intercepted a 911 call 
by mistake, so distraught was I.

Well, it wasn’t rust that had immobilized the 
flue – it was a damned dead raccoon, utterly 
undislodgeable by now, who had fallen down the 
chimney, probably because he had been draping 
and warming his butt over the hole to catch the 
upward currents. And they can’t get him out! At 
least not until spring when the weather allows 
them to crawl around the roof and lift up the 
chimney liner.

They think they have sealed the stove opening. 
I certainly hope so. Talk about unwelcome house-
guests! And I’ll spray insecticide up the chimney 
now and then. And I’ve not seen a fly now for two 
and a half-hours. So I am hopeful.

In the meantime, I have exhausted myself. I am, 
I fear, quite sick, aching in every muscle for 
some reason, and perhaps especially my eyes, though
I keep trying to read a rather nice little book 
about how Sikhs and Muslims kill – and are killed 
by – Hindus in India. It might make a good expose 
of what Sahu calls “the largest democracy in the 
world.” Ha! I might use it. I’ve made little progress 
on book selections, and I feel a bit in a panic.

But anyway I will try to drive up in the morning – 
I’ll call if I feel as bad as I do now. I think 
maybe I have my end-of-term physiological collapse – 
with a bit of mood thrown in as well.


Love you all.

Dad

This is a true story. It makes me glad I have a 
relatively normal life and that my holidays, 
though hectic, are not natural disasters on a 
grand scale. I did edit the mail for typos, and 
removed some of the usual banal “hope you are well” 
type of boring stuff. I think I may send this off to 
Dave Barry, he would surely relate…
