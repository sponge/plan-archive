Well looks like this will be my last update this year, since I go on 
vacation (like half the office) tomorrow and won't be back until 2000.
I will NOT say this is my last post for the millenium, since anyone with
basic math and history skills knows that 2000 is the last year of this 
century/millenium, not 1999. Oh, and there is no such thing as year 0 either,
just 1 BC and 1 AD. Get over it.

First, I want to thank everyone here at Raven, and by extension at
Activision, for another great year. I especially want to thank Brian
and Steve for pushing hard to make sure both SOF and ST:VEF become 
great games and not just games released in a certain fiscal quarter.
It's hard to wait sometimes, but I think it is worthwhile in most cases.

I also want to thank Kenn, Eric, Jon, Chris and more other people than
I want to bother typing for making Raven still a fun place to work,
instead of just another job.

And of course there are all the people out there who buy our games and 
enjoy them, especially those loyal fans who actually send us feedback so
we can keep improving our games rather than making the same stupid 
mistakes over and over and over and over again.

Finally I want to thank my wife Jenifer and daughter Kathleen for having 
the patience (or at least faking it) to put up with both me and my job.

If I forgot anyone, that's just me and my rapidly-decaying grey cells,
it's not intentional.

That's it, not too original and probably boring, but somehow I think
we'll all survive it.

Until 2000

Well, initial run (base architecture, lighting and textures) is done on all
the maps -- some more than others ;) -- and it's on to scripting. Man, going
back to the Voyager levels after being away a while is... interesting...

We're still getting emails with that damn "Check This" virus, doesn't
ANYBODY ever learn about this? Some people just shouldn't be allowed to
use technology without a license...

Oh framgious light map, why dost thou bloat my BSP so much?

Yet another level split into two levels. Sigh.

Jeremy says he has a brush nicer than the one Oz made. Must look into this,
I have a place in my level that needs a new brush...

Hmm, Oz haz accuzed me of ztealing hiz bruzhez for my map. Thiz iz not true!
I merely liberated them from the opprezzive regime of hiz mapz to the free
and open zociety of my own mapz. Which iz to zay that I took hiz bruzhez,
ripped out the wallz and floorz and ceilingz, and made them pretty. In my
map.


One totally un-game-related note: Dumarest? Dray Prescot? Anyone? Anyone?

Wow, sorry it has been so long since the last update, but things have
been kinda busy. We're starting to really define the look and feel for
the last area of STV:EF, and hopefully the levels should start coming 
together in the next week or so. Also I have been spending a lot of
time following the new message boards for STV:EF, SOF and our classic
games, there has been a lot of really good response from people out
there and I want you all to feel like we are actually paying attention.
Just realize that some of your more crazy ideas will be treated as
such ;)

On the home front I am recovering nicely from the latest Favre-induced
coronary, I hope to be off the pacemaker before the next game. This is
really getting kinda stressful -- but at least we're still winning! The
gods of football even took pity on poor Bob and Bobby (part of the morning
team here at Radio Raven) and let the Bears and Dolphins win. The
suicide watch has been temporarily suspended.

See you on the boards...

Well I have discovered the 3 primary factors that contribute to heart
attacks in so many young Wisconsin men. 

1) Excessive consumption of alcohol. Not only is Wisconsin the #1 per
capita consumer of brandy, but the average college-aged (which here means
under 40) male has a blood alcohol level of 0.15 BEFORE they start drinking.

2) Cheese. My guess is that if you cut open one of our standard citizens,
great globs of cheddar would come oozing out of their veins instead of 
blood. Maybe we should make that a console variable for SOF: "turn on
cheese gibs".

3) The cumulative effect of watching the Packers (or more specifically Brett
Favre) wait until the last 2 minutes of EVERY game before actually deciding 
maybe they should do something significant, and then moving at an AMAZING
pace down the field to a) make the final game-winning score in the last 
6 seconds, or b) MISS the game-winning score in the last 6 seconds. Eventually
the alternating win-loss stress creates a harmonic vibration that ruptures
all the vessels in your head, causing great gobbets of cheese to ooze from
your eyes, and brandy to snort from your nose.

That's why I moved here.



Oh, for those who care about work stuff, we're almost done with the latest
Voyager area, we have only a little more to go before the endless cycle
of script, tweak, rebuild sets in. I'm looking forward to that, too.

Well as promised I checked out the suggestions sent to me in response to
my rants about pop-ups and other annoying internet crap. Some of the 
emails were sympathy only, some were suggestions of how to "fix" IE5,
and some were links to programs that (supposedly) fixed one or more of the
problems I was encountering. So, in order of how helpful these were to
me:

Sympathy - maybe this should not be at the bottom, it did make me feel
like I was not the only one out there with major complaints and no idea
how to fix them. Then again, it didn't get me any closer to my goal.
But thanks anyway, it did lighten my mood a bit.

IE5 "fixes": these ranged from "disabling JAVA" to some more arcane and
esoteric juggling of security settings or the like. While some of these
might have worked, the main reason I was bitching on my finger file rather
than fixing it myself was that I am not a programmer, have no interest
in getting into the guts of programs any more than necessary, even to
the extent of going in to deep options and clicking a few buttons. I'm
a designer, which means that program-wise I want the easiest (for me)
solution available, so long as it makes what I am doing look pretty and
do what I want. Besides. Some of the sites I do visit (like Yahoo!Bridge)
just don't run without JAVA. So, again thanks for the ideas, I'm sure
they would work for more enterprising people than me.

Programs: Ok first a short list of programs that were suggested to me that
I just didn't try. The main reason I didn't try them is that they either cost
money (I'm cheap as well as lazy) or didn't seem to cover enough of what
I wanted. And there was one that might have been good but the link was 
expired. At least it wasn't a pop-up ;)

<a href = "http://www.intercantech.com/">AdsOff! And PopOff!</a>
These might have worked fine, but only PopOff was free, you have to pay for 
AdsOff and we already know what a cheap bastard I am.

<a href = "http://software.xfx.net/utilities/popupkiller/">PopUp Killer</a>
At first this seemed very promising, it has a list of banned PopUp sites
you can download to update your list, and you can send your list to their 
site as well. But for some reason I could not get it to work. I even went
to GeoCities (one of their banned PopUp sites) and still got PopUps. Maybe
I did something wrong. Oh well.

<a href = "http://www.intermute.com/">InterMute</a>
Looks very nice, but it only has a 14-day trial and then you have to pay, and
(all together again!) I am a cheap bastard.

<a href = "http://www.atguard.com/">@Guard</a>
Another possibly good program I am too cheap to buy.

<a href = "http://www.netcaptor.com/">NetCaptor</a>
Actually a very nice IE5 overlay, it separates windows into little tab groups
so you can browse them faster and easier. It is free (little ads in the corner
instead of the MS logo but that's no big deal, and you can get the "Pro" 
version without ads for $15 if they really bug you), and does have a "no pop-up"
feature, but you have to manually enter the sites that pop-ups come from, 
which we all know (all together now!) I am too lazy to do. Also, an odd
little annoyance is that there is no History button and I could not find
an easy way to access History from the menu. Hmm.

And now the winner, the program that meets all my stringent requirements (well,
almost!). It is called <a href = "http://members.tripod.com/Proxomitron/">Proximitron</a>
Proximitron is a very versatile program that can kill or limit banner ads,
pop-ups, redirects and all sorts of nasty JAVA crap. It does take more
customization than I would absolutely prefer (i.e. none), but the default
settings would probably work for most people. You can even turn it on and off
dynamically so I can load my Yahoo!Bridge game (cheer!). The only other
oddity is that it is something called (I do not make this up) ShonenWare,
and users are encouraged to go out and buy music from a group called
Shonen Knife http://home.earthlink.net/~gwiz/ShonenLA.html to keep them
making music which will keep the maker of Proximitron happy so he keeps
making improvements to the program. Weird, but I will probably try the music
anyway since this seems such a weird and cool way to do things.


OK, hope this works for more of you people out there, hope I didn't piss
anyone off (except the pushers of popups, redirects and banner ads, who can
rot in hell for all I care), and until next time, just remember that

Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wagn'nagl fhtagn!

9-17-99 Part II !!!

Wow! Just go to lunch and see what my latest finger rant generated while I 
was gone! My gentle little comments about frustrations with internet crap
netted me not one or even two but SEVERAL suggestions (along with expressions
of similar frustration at how messy the web has become). I am going to check
them all out and will post my findings next week. Thanks to everyone who
responded!

Guess it's been a while since the last update...

Work stuff first: been slaving away at the latest mission, it's totally cool
stuff but totally different from the last mission (heavier look, less curves
but more open space) so it's been a struggle to switch mental gears. It's
really starting to pull together though. And it helps that we (the designers)
all steal pieces from each other, are actually encouraged to do so for 
"consistency" sake. Tom loved my crew quarter hallways, especially how he
had to fix them since just two short segments somehow bloated his map to over
8 megs ;)


Non-work stuff now: edited Bob Love's book "The Land of Confusion" (the one
he started online in his finger file), it was funny, but of course full of 
typos. No wonder our code is so bug-filled if the programmers all type like
that... ;)


Now a short rant: I remember when I first got Win95, how annoyed I was that 
the defaults for file/folder viewing were to hide all the things I want to see
(system files etc.) , show files without extensions or info and with damn huge 
icons, and open new windows every time I opened a folder. Sure I could 
customize it to look the way I want, but that's a pain. Now I am on to 
IE Explorer, or more accurately the fact that with every website out there
now put up through some damn commercial site, every time I open a site or 
click a link I get tehse stupid pop-up windows. Game sites are no better, 
I signed up for some online contest and TEN little windows popped up in a
pretty pattern, freezing my screen, crashing my programs and locking the modem
because they all wanted to open at once. Then you have the ones with 
"hidden" URLs that redirect you every time you try to back up (what the
hell good is a back button if you can't back up past these things) or worse
when you close a window a new one loads to (usually) some online casino or 
porn site! IF I want porn I'll go get it myself, don't send me there when 
I'm trying to look for game demos or freeware apps!!!! And then there are 
(can you tell this has been stewing for a while?) those framed sites that 
load up links INSIDE their frame, instead of letting me go there direct. And
the links that instead of loading in the same window, open a new window, so 
you can't back out from them either, you have to clsoe the new window (if you 
notice it) and go to the old one, hoping you did not close THAT one by
mistake. Sooooooooooo, what can we do about this? IE5 does not (as far as I
know) allow you to disable ANY of these annoying "functions". What I would 
love to see (email me if you know of one!) is some kind of IE5 overlay or
plugin that would basically intercept/interpret these "functions" as they 
are sent to the browser window, and deal with them appropriately (refusing 
or ignoring pop-ups, keeping everything full-screen in the same window,
bypassing "hidden" URLs). I'm sure this would piss off the advertisers and
hucksters who make their money by how many hits they generate or how many 
times people get lost on their sites, but all I can say to that is "Wahh!"

And for all you advertisers or supporters who want to email me explaining 
how un-annoying and beneficial these practises are, I say "go ahead". At least
Office has a Junk Email filter that I can add your address to...

Just in time for the end of the month, a couple of the guys from our office
showed up at one of the local TV stations for a live interview. It's 
wonderful what live (read: you-can't-take-it-back) TV does for such media-
savvy guys as our typical programmers. Heh.

Still, they did get a few good plugs for our current line-up. So, without
further ado, I offer special thanks to:

Jake "Porn Pipe" Simpson
Rick "That's Gore Zone not Gorgon" Johnson
Rob "Cut My Head Off Above My Beard" Gee
and "The Silent Artist Not Even Dignified By Having His Head Cut Off".

One last note, as far as I know there is no band named either Simpson & 
Johnson or Rick & Jake. Yet.

Trying to balance finishing up one level and starting another at the same
time is really fun. Really. I like it. A lot.

Did have some spare time while waiting for another full BSP to answer some
questions about Heretic and Hexen for an <a href = "http://www.ngnetwork.com/interviews/raymond-judy260899/">interview</a> at <a href = "http://www.ngnetwork.com">ngNetwork</a>.

Glad to see there is still some interest out there in our older stuff.

There's nothing like taking a week off to visit family (in-laws actually)
and returning to find yourself a week behind everyone else...

Aside from the 85 emails I received (2 of which were relevant to work) I
found that several major changes had been made and I had to re-BSP
ALL my maps. Sigh. Also heard the unpleasant news that the trap I had
set for the company picnic (schedule it the week I'm gone, will they?!)
was circumvented by the local constabulatory and the amazingly persistent
efforts of our own Raven staff. If it had been anyone else than Kim trapped
inside, they would have left him to rot! But then, Kim is kinda cute (although
not, as has been said about Bob Love, a "very attractive man"). Besides,
if we left Kim there we'd have no one to introduce at the bi-weekly staff
meetings...

It almost makes me wish I had stayed in Idaho.




Almost.

Finally made it to GenCon this Sunday, it has changed (and gotten a lot
bigger) since the long-ago days when last I went. More booths, more games,
more weird costumes... I think the reason some of the people wear them to 
GenCon is that it's probably one of the few public places they can do so
without getting arrested. I'm not sure, but I think I may have offended
one of the women there when I started laughing when I frist saw her.

Both Star Trek: Voyager and S.O.F. got lots of attention and almost 
completely good reviews by those who said things I could overhear. A few
people picked on little details but the overall reaction seemed to be 
amazed approval. More than a few people said "Finally, a Star Trek game
that is fun!". Their words, not mine.

Was also pleased to note the other Activision showings were getting 
good reception too, I think it really helped having several Trek titles
all together. Anyone with any interest in Trek at all could find something
that appealed to them.

We, back to finishing up my Stasis mission level, got to get it done by
Friday...

Hmmm, yet another long gap since my last update. I have been suffering
I think from PMS (Patch Mesh Syndrome), which has made me cranky and
uncommunicative. While I must say the new areas are super cool, and we
have defintely pushed the Q3 limits on curves as far as any rational
(or perhaps irrational) person should, it has also been a nightmare trying
to line up all the weird angles. Finally got through my thick skull what
seems to be the curve wall equivalent of "grid of 8". All patch meshes and
curves which touch and you want to have textures line up on must have the
same grid size (3x3 is best for most things). It only took having to scrap 
a whole huge aera to figure this out.

GenCon is this weekend, I won't get there until Sunday, but that's better
than usual since I have missed the last 3 years running. At least by then I 
can be sure that the demo machines are all set up and running :)

Back to the salt mines for me...

Well finally got the last part of my Scavenger area put together, it's
full-vising now so I have a few minutes (OK about 2 hours) to catch
up on stuff like this thing. Aside from the hassles of building things
in segments for multiple elevations and then trying to line them up 
vertically, things went pretty well for this level. Also had to remember 
that any time I mirrored or flipped a curved surface I had to also re-
flip the matrices. There's nothing like going into a room and seeing
through the back of all the control consoles and walls...

Can't wait to get started on the next area, what we have planned is really
cool, lots of curves and animated textures. I'm still in planning stages
and waiting for prototypes and "style" examples to be approved, but what
we have so far is awesome.

Well, back to the machine for now, I can at least get some writing done.

Had to update this even if I'm at home for the weekend. My daughter (she's
6) was reading about the battle of Agincourt, and was asking about some
of the pictures. SHe was also trying to explain about the benefits of
short versus long arrows, when suddenly she stopped and asked "which ones
are the bad guys". I tried to explain to her that one side was English and
the other French, therefor they were BOTH bad guys -- OK, actually I tried
explaining that both sides thought of themselves as good and the other
guys as bad, but the truth was more complex and not so easy to sort out.
I guess this was hard for her, since 6-year-olds like their fights more
"Disney-fied" with sinister villains and handsome heros and beautiful maids
to be rescued. So I explained that they were not fighting between Good and
Evil, but that they were fighting over a piece of land that both sides 
thought belonged to them. Her response? "Fighting over a piece of land?
That's STUPID Daddy!"

Out of the mouths of babes...

Well updating from home this time, hope this works.

I have been working for the last weeks on one of the Trek scavenger levels, 
wish I could tell you more but I think it will be a (hopefully pleasant)
surprise. I had hoped that a simpler structural requirement would mean 
easier building, but as always I have filled in all available space so that
quantity overwhelms the engine anyway. When I can tell you more this will
make sense (or not -- as I said this is from home and the Knockando is 
starting to take hold).

I took a week of "vacation" last week, not sure it was very restful. Spent
a couple days cleaning and such, watching the Tribble (the new Trekker slang
for my daughter) while the spousal unit did gardening, and generally 
wathced a whole week of vacation slide by. Why am I so tired then?

Will check with Starfleet about what more I can say about the scavenger
stuff I am working on, otherwise just want to lament that so far I have
failed to implement my trademark "pick up the goodie and get crushed or
swarmed by monsters" trap scenario. I have so far managed this in every game
since Shadowcaster (look it up if you haven't played it) and despite the
"No Kill I" philosophy of Trek am looking for ways to insinuate it into 
this game :)  There are a few acolytes (Tom OD seems to have picked up the
habit) who might be able to implement it vicariously, but it's just not the
same. Kind of like phone sex...

More to follow.

Well, I guess it's official. Today a representative of the Computer Games
Paleontological Society sent me notice that from this date forward I will
be viewed as a "relic". Yes, it was an amazing SIX YEARS AGO today that
I started working at Raven Software. As indication of the vast temporal
span which has passed since I began working here, consider the following:

When I first started working at Raven...

 1. We were just UPGRADING to 386's. I was really pleased that I got a 14"
    monitor instead of one of the old 13" ones.
 2. Wolfenstein was still a new game.
 3. Doom? Wasn't that the name of the sorcerer guy in that Conan movie?
 4. Microsoft shares were less than $10
 5. I still had visible hair on the top of my head. Ok on most of it. Well,
    at least part of the top of my head was covered by a few hairs combed
    in a big wave.
 6. Raven was still owned by Brian and Steve Raffel, although our souls
    were held in lien by EA/Origin.
 7. My daughter was just 2 weeks old. Good thing I was already used to 
    operating on long hours and no sleep.
 8. There were just 8 people at Raven (counting the 3 of us who started on
    the same day).
 9. We did not have internet access at work. Our LAN was pretty shaky, too.
10. RPGs were still hot, shooters were just emerging as a force, side-
    scrolling puzzle-jumpers like Prince of Persia were the rage.

Well, now that I am thoroughly depressed, it's time to go home and have a
nice bottle -- uh, I mean GLASS, yeah, glass -- of scotch. BTW, the average
price of the scotch I drank then: about $8 a bottle. Now? $50. How times
do change things :)
