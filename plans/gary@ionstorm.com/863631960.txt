New Building, New .PLAN

--------------------------------------------------
I'm stuck in diamond hell right now...
My life is a game of Tetris gone horribly wrong...
But it will soon ROCK...
--------------------------------------------------

I was gonna try and do a real complex little HTML thing like some of the guys here are doing, but I figured I'd rather spend my time playing MDK and XvT (yeah, I know, there a lot about it that dissapoints, but it's so FUN actually grinding Noel and Squirrel into space dust, not that I've ever won a full battle against them...).

I used to be the sole artist on Stranded/Remora/Doppleganger, building little blocks, testing technology, etc.  Now I have a minion.  Well, maybe not a minion...more like a lackey...:D

The technology we're getting thrown at us for Todd's game is intense.  A lot to figure out, but it will break a lot of rules in the Diablo/C&C arena.

So there ya have it.  A whole lotta productive stuff going on.  I don't get interviewed, I don't get to go to E3, and I don't play quake enough to be good at it, any more.  So you won't hear much about either of those three topics from me.

If anyone is actually paying atention, I'll give as much info as I am allowed, and if there's no interesting news goin on, then I'll probably be working on something that'll evolve into something interesting.  This is the start of the ride for Team Doppleganger...

Well, to anyone who has any reservations about it, GO SEE THE 5TH ELEMENT!!!  This movie is so much fun, and broke a lot of conventions in the mainstream sci-fi genre.  Killer fun.

Other than that, kinda dull day.  I'm amazed that I'm still here at the office.  It's Friday and all, but I'll play some MDK and wait to go see The 5th Element again tonight at The Grand.  I'm not certain what was up with Theatre 24, where we saw it, but it seemed like they had some busted speakers (like the BASS and a couple of surrounds).  I know this is petty, but when Ruby starts doing his gig, it's like you can't hear him while he's broadcasting his show.  NEWayz...

Just as a pure gloating thing for me (and not that it's really that big of a deal), I FINALLY beat Chrono Trigger.  I've had this game since the day it came out (about this time in 1995).  I finally sat down and finished this (mostly due to John's CT Challenge).  Secret of Mana is next.  I got this one this past weekend, so I'm pretty sure it'll get finished quicker...

That's all, for now...
