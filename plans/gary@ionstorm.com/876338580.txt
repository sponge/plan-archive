Okay...personal life ramble here for a minute.  Bear with me...it's Wednesday and it already a weird week.

First off, the bad news...what the hell is it with lack of respect for other's property?!?  Yes, I'm another
victim of the IonCar Curse.  Some low/no life punk broke into my car, taking my entire center console (including
the stereo), busting my window, screwing up my airbag controls and my driver's side tires.  I'm not gonna bitch
and moan too much, cause we're aparently all targets nowadays, but I just don't get it.  Plus, if you're gonna
steal shit outta my car, at least do it right!!!  Take the Rollerblades and sunglasses!  Please, search the ENTIRE F*#&$%' car.  The only thing worse than a criminal is a lazy ass criminal.  Show some initiative, for God's
sake...

Next, the cool news...I got to meet Sarah Mclachlan!  Anyone who knows me knows how much I love this woman's music.
Some have even gone so far to say that I'm obsessed.  But I'm not!!! Really.  Well, not too obsessed :)
My roommate won a contest.  I got to go, as a guest.  Free lunch at The Dark Room, a free mini-concert by Sarah, a picture WITH Sarah (of me with perma-grin), and a free autographed copy of her new album.  A cool score, especially considering the week I've had.  Yeah, so...I'm obsessed...

Now for work stuff...

Everyone on Team Doppelganger (yes...even the programmers, too ;) ), has kicked ass meeting our deadline.  Patrick, Jay-Dub, and Matt have kicked ass on terrain, Rob, Hugh, and Jay have dominated on monsters (about 30   characters/creatures processed, textured, and walk-cycled in about a month!), Chris has kicked on weapons and armor, and Paul has pumped out some cool new concepts that really give the game a new atmosphere and the end result is a VERY unique looking title, even at this early stage.  Now that just about all of our technical hurdles of been broken, our progress is moving ahead nicely.  Too bad, though.  You won't get an excessive amount of hype (read: pictures) out of us until a little later in the game.  You'll like it, though.  You just have to wait for it...

Game of the Week:

Castlevania: Symphony of the Night for the PSX.

This game rocks.  Beautiful graphics, great music, another classic Konami game.  A lot like Metroid / Super Metroid / Blaster Master, gameplay wise.  But with the cool trappings of a Castlevania game.  I've beaten it already, but the number of secrets hiding in it has got me coming back for more.
