I have been playing Giants: Citizen Kabuto. For the first 10 missions or so this is one awesome game. The humor, the story, the gameplay, the entire look and feel of this alien world all add up to one incredible experience. It's nothing short of dazzling.

Now I've reached a point where I'm trying to play Giants, but I can't beat the mission. Why? Not because it's too difficult, but because the game keeps crashing on me. Since there isn't a "save anywhere" feature I keep having to start over. This is very frustrating and I've nearly given up on the single player game. I won't get into the entire "save anywhere" debate, but if you're not going to allow the player to save his progress, then the missions need to be relatively short, and easy enough that I can progress through each one in only one or two tries. Also, the game needs be stable enough to run without crashing to Windows until I can beat the mission. 

So Planet Moon created this beautiful world, with an engaging story and fun gameplay. I can't help but think they've really got their act together. What went wrong? I think in this instance we can place the blame squarely on the shoulders of Interplay. It's a story you've heard before: the suits forced a talented group of developers to ship a buggy, incomplete game for Christmas. If they'd just taken another month or two and worked out the kinks, Giants would probably have been one of the greatest games of all time. Way to go, Interplay. As a game fan, I don't care when the game ships, just make sure it's done when it hits the shelves. I'll still be here, ready to buy it. 

When Planet Moon releases a playable demo, I highly recommend checking it out. The first mission alone will make you want to buy the game. If they release a patch that fixes the crash bugs (and maybe adds a save anywhere feature) then you are in for a real treat.
