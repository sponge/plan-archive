Plan:
- Hammered .plan files -
 My friend calls me up and yells at me above the roar of some Quake II - =
(Chaos MOD) internet deathmatch game=20
"Ron, what's up with all your tweaked and/or missing .plan files dude?"

 So, I cruise to the site and take a look after a quick flic through my =
old .plans I replied,=20

Multiple choice answer:
a) "I was abducted by Aliens a few times while working on my .plan =
files.  For some strange reasons they seem to like erasing and sending =
my .plan file before returning me back to earth." alien voices>
b) "Those days, I had just enough energy left in my arms and hands to =
open up and save my .plan file, but not enough to actually type =
anything." 
c) "It's a secret code, call me back if you figure it out!" 
d) "Oh, they were deleted or test .plans or something...I guess they =
never got deleted right."=20
e) "What?... Hey, I hear that.  What server you on dude?"  =
"Oh yeah?"  loading up> 

;-)

Ok, it's late and I'm tired...

Seriously though, what is up with those?  Can someone fix em for me?  =
Thanks.=20

- BLADE - (I said I would tell yah what I thought of it...)
Some of the guys here really got into Blade, but I didn't like too much =
.... I didn't hate it either though... It was your average comic book =
style movie with some neato special f/x... Part of it was that I'm still =
reeling from Saving Private Ryan and part of it was the cheesy theatre =
in which I saw it...what an absolute contrast in listening =
enjoyment...I'm so spoiled now by the kick ass digital surround sound =
and massive screens in one of the zillion theatres we have around here =
that when I go to your run of the mill "cinema" with what seems to be a =
good but nonetheless "average" sound system, it always seems to make the =
movie suck. What's worse is that some movies ain't that good =
twice...good sound or not.

- QUAKE II - Chaosquake -
"Hmmmm...I'm tired and should go home...but.... I need to satisfy the =
Quake God before I go...just ONE game.. just ONE..."
Heh.  I've said that to myself one too many times over the course of the =
past week.  Chaos Quake IS a blast!
I love the Sword, the little crazy happy faced "Yippeeee!" bouncing =
mines (man those things are bastardly), and the new actions like kick, =
fakedeath and vomit commands among other things.  Check it out.  Perhaps =
I'll see you online...fodder boy!!!

.... AAwww yeah!=20
