Plan:
In light of the recent exodus of a combined 13 people from Blizzard and =
Blizzard North in the last week, I'd like to say a few words to both =
those who left and those who remain.

To those who left:
I understand it was probably a difficult and perhaps scary thing to do =
to leave Blizzard but I hope you did it honorably and for the right =
reasons.  I wish you the best of luck in whatever projects you are now =
working on.=20

To those that remain:
-The writing is on the wall -

I'm sorry but no matter how you slice it, Blizzard is in bad shape and I =
think unless the management realizes that some major changes need to be =
made and fast.  If, after all the talk is through, nothing much changes, =
I predict that Blizzard will be over in less than a year.  You guys need =
to pay your people what they really deserve, either now or in royalities =
later.  The higher ups need to open their eyes and ears and learn how to =
distinguish between those that really what they're talking about when it =
comes to games, and those that are just kissing their ass for a =
promotion, a buck or a pat on the head.   Making stupid moves like =
taking on lame excess games, placing PR guys or failed programmers in =
charge of the game design and/or promoting them when they blow it, etc. =
These kinds of decisions continue to astound me, especially when they =
come from a bunch of supposedly smart guys that are game dev. veterans.  =
 I personally doubt anything good is going to come of this but If you =
can pull out of this nose dive and turn Blizzard back around I think =
you'll have a fighting chance of keeping it together.  I wish all of you =
 the best of luck and hope you can carry on the Blizzard name in true =
Blizzard style.=20

To wrap it up...
Well, I guess we'll see how things turn out from here on out eh? I =
predict things will get worse pretty friggin' quickly as people get =
frustrated and demoralized with Blizzard's managment and/or they =
discover the financial potential working for themselves or someone else =
can bring.  I'd like to add that I feel bad for all the hard working, =
honorable and loyal people caught up in the middle of this bullshit and =
my heart goes out especially to those who lost their life savings over =
Cendant's fraudulent activities.  Having 13 people walk out is one =
thing.  There are some logistics to solve quickly and a morale problem =
to overcome at worst.  Having any stock options you own turn to dirt =
after 5 hard years of work is much more devastating on morale than any =
walkout could ever be.=20

Good luck to you all.=20

Sincerely,=20
