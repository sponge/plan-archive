My favorite Games of 1998-(not that anyone cares-but anyway-in no specific order)

Quake2 (although released in December 1997-it's still a classic)

Starcraft-Some of the most impressive Graphics for menus and movies in any game.
Unique mythology and character designs. One of the best RTS games ever made.

Descent Freespace: HUGE ships! Ongoing war with plot twists, mission based, excellent effects, outstanding weapon designs, got drawn into this one and couldn't wait to see what was next.

Commandoes: Unique thinking, awesome mission settings- but HARD HARD HARD. I still haven't finished it. The mission designs are stunning.

Ultima Online: Still playing.Ongoing game that you never "beat" and delete off yer hardrive. Haven't been PK'ed in 6 months :)

Fallout 2: I missed Fallout 1, I absolutely was thoroughly impressed by the sequel. Great settings, bloody combat hit animations, unique story and mythos. The menu style with it's retro-industrial feel was executed perfectly.

Unreal: Biased. Bluff Eversmoking one of my all time favorites. The Skaarj Warrior has to be one of the best monsters ever done in FPS for combat skill.

Heretic 2: EFFECTS!! Mucho animations, Melee combat with blood flying everywhere. Awesome Co-op play. Drop kicking that final boss with Brandon was hilarious. That sneak animation is the best.
Staff weapon the BOMB! I think I played 95% of the entire game slinging that kick ass staff around.

Baldur's Gate: AD&D true to original and hugeeeeee. Close to ending-stuck on 2 Greater basilisks.

Half-Life: The coolest Machine gun I've ever used. Great effects. Unique storyline. Hundreds of maps. Laser Trip mines perfect.
NPC interaction. The Marines are totally fun.
Hardest skill level uncanny.
