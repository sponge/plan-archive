Two Words.

Baldur's Gate

The absolute Premier Hard Core RolePlaying game. Bioware I salute you. Your workmanship is superb. Playing cooperatively is absolutely awesome-especially if yer on the phone. My AD&D days go back to 1978 and this is the kind of game development that makes me cheer. Outstanding.....simply Outstanding.

Ahh what a relaxing jaunt.
I am back from snowboarding my ass off at Lake Tahoe.
I'll be going through emails and replying over the next day or so.
Hope everyone had a safe holiday and of course.
Happy New Year1


Wishing everyone out there in the gaming industry a Happy Holidays. Gamers, Online Media/Press people and Developers!

Merry Christmas!

I'm off to Tahoe to sling some snow, break some important extremities, and mush dogs.
If you're driving anywhere don't drink!
Just stay by the fire and get toasted.
