Legals would have gone here if I had spent many years
in college to be a lawyer.  As, however, I have not done that, this
is not a valid statement of Epic Games.

  SSX for PSX2 RULES!  I haven't ever been much of a sports game player, but
this is one spectacular game!  The courses are incredible, the amount of stuff
to unlock is daunting, the controls are kickass, and the game is overall fun
to play!

 In other news, I got a new tattoo for my birthday, and the artist did a really
damn good job.  Those of you in the Raleigh area who might be interested in a 
tattoo, the artist is:

Hunter Spanks

at

Start 2 Finish Tattoo
3999 Hillsborough St

Its very close to I-440.

  Well, another year gone by, and still I don't *feel* old, though some people
may disagree and say I'm much too old already (at least where musical taste is
concerned).  My birthday is tomorrow (yes, my birthday really is Halloween) and
I've decided that for the very first time, I'm not doing anything, no party, no
travelling to see relatives, no cake.  May sound boring, but remember, since I'm
turning 26, that means I've had 25 birthday parties already, some of them
involving a 16 hour round trip drive back to Birmingham to spend it with my
parents.  This is much less stressful :)

  In other news, we finally got our real office furniture, which might not sound
very exciting to anyone else, but since we've spent the last 2+ years working on
folding tables in white rooms (most of us, at least), this is a HUGE change!  
Shane, Cliff and I spent a few days taking our stuff down and painting, so now we
have a very nicely appointed office to walk in to every day.  Check the webcams
(Cliff and I both have one) to catch a glimpse of the new decor.

Crunch mode.... sigh.

In other news, Cliff and I did a fun interview together... Think deathmatch
with words!  Check it at <a href="http://www.3dactionplanet.com/features/interviews/duel/">3D Action Planet</a> and see my horrible pictures.

And finally (and I know I'm prob. going to regret this) my webcam exists at <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~mobius/campics/webcam">this
link</a> so anyone who's interested is more than welcome to drop in and check it
out.  I leave it up 24/7 (provided the machine its running on doesn't do anything
totally stupid, which it is prone to do) and I'm planning on making the streaming
link available soon.

 Just found that I'm STILL paying for an old Allegiance account... Is it me, or
is it almost impossible to find where to cancel a zone account?  I ended up
following links all the way back to Microsoft's main web pages to find a 
FAQ that even mentioned the possibility of daring to dream of cancelling
your billing account... Argh.  For anyone who needs to know, you have to
go to the Zone site for each individual game you are paying for, and cancel
your subscription for that particular game.

 Wow, <a href="http://www.runegame.com">RuneGame</a> just went live, and it rocks!  The HH guys should be damn
proud of it... Rune is one of the games that I'm looking forward to, and this
gives the anticipation an even finer edge :)

This is a <a href="http://sinfest.net/d/20000206.html">needful thing</a>.  Sorry, just had to put that up.
Oh, and since I'm not the one actually purchasing the Cyclone, the price does
matter... I need to find one in ANY condition, for under $4000 US.  If the
car needs serious renovation, that's fine, as long as it has an engine, tranny,
and all major parts

 Not too much happening in the world of me at the moment.  ICQ is a wonderful thing,
it allows me to meet new people all the time, especially this last week (you know
who you are KW).  Been playing Diablo2, though not too much the last few days... 
I'm on Act 3, the second & third quests. Bought Icewind Dale and Dark Reign 2,
but I've only had time to fool around with DR2 (which is cool).  Work progresses
on the PlayStation 2 port for UT, no big surprise there.

 For the record, I'm looking for a very specific car.  A 1970 Mercury Cyclone
Spoiler 429CJ w/ manual tranny... Anybody out there who knows where I can find one?
  I'm on a deadline to find it (early Sept), as its to be a gift for my Father for
his 50th birthday.

 Oh, and Levelord, I'm with you man... We're all sick of CliffryB and his tyrannical
ways!  I'll gladly stuff HIM in a bongbottle for you!  Just give me a shipping
address....

 Got back from Dragon*Con sunday, and WOW did I have a good time!  Spent
pretty much the whole 'Con hanging out with Pete Abrams (of <a href="http://www.sluggy.com">Sluggy Freelance</a>
fame), and his friends/lackeys/minions... The costumes I saw while there
were incredible, and though I wish the convention had been laid out a little
closer together (there were 3 main parts, all in different buildings), I 
still had an wonderful time while I was there.

So remember, go read <a href="http://www.sluggy.com">Sluggy Freelance</a>, and make sure you read at least until Bun-Bun makes his
appearance... You'll thank me for it!

 Its official.  As of approximately 7pm Eastern time, Sunday June 11th, Cliff
Bleszinski and Darcy Brennan tied the knot.  In a very nice ceremony, in a 
castle of all places, friends and family watched as they were married.  I know
we are all very truly happy for both of them.

p.s. If anyone wishes to send a gift, the easiest way is to access their online
registry, by <a href="http://www.theknot.com/ecframer.cgi?target=kr_select2000.html&member=90605163446">clicking here</a>. 

My HTML skillz are rusty, so forgive me if the link is wrong.
