Legals would have gone here if I had spent many years
in college to be a lawyer.  As, however, I have not done that, this
is not a valid statement of Epic Games.

 The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Epic go out to all the people who

God bless.

Wooow, no long delay this time :D
I'm probably going to get in trouble for this, but wth.

Well here we go again with the long delays between .plan updates.

Oh well.  It could be worse, I could still be running a gaming news site.
(no offense, guys, its HARD, I know, but I'd never update!)

Lets see, looking forward to the Jay and Silent Bob movie, mildly interested
in a few other flicks that are coming out, but none that really stick out
except for Harry Potter.  Oh, and Gwar's new album will be released about the
same time.  Is that a moral contradiction, liking Harry Potter and Gwar at
the same time?  

Either way, its all good. I'm going to go see Tool in concert on the 7th
of next month, which will be very cool, second time for me, last time was
during the Undertow tour.  And I got my nose broken in the mosh, but didn't
give a d*mn.

So, all in all a very non-gaming related update.  Haven't played Max Payne
yet, want to.  Still eagerly awaiting Yuri's Revenge.  And Warcraft 3. And
Metal Gear Solid 2.  Later, people.

 Onimusha rules!  I finished the game about a half an hour ago, and we 
(Steve Garofalo and I) were blown away!  Not only is the game fun all
the way through, but the cinematics, both in-engine and prerendered were
all incredible!  I didn't finish with everything (not all the fluorite, didn't
go through the Dark Realm) so I'm going to go back and take care of the things
I missed.

 Now we need 'Devil May Cry' which looks like its going to be the office 
successor to Onimusha, at least as far as sucking Steve and my time up :)

Okay, just watched the Tomb Raider trailer, which is a cool trailer, nothing
AMAZINGLY cool about it, but one thing is driving me insane... The music at 
the end of it!  I KNOW I've heard that song before, but I CANNOT think of
who it is or the name of the song.  I'm even fairly certain I have the CD
with it somewhere, but I can't come up with what it is!

 Thanks to anyone who knows it and sends me the info.

Beware Psyduck by the way... They've invaded the office in force, and have
taken up residence in the most unlikely of places, like the Coke fridge and
the telescope.  They're these little (2, 2 1/1 inch tall) yellow ducks with
a small microphone in the beak and a speaker in their head, and all they do
is make three noises, each specially tuned to irritate and annoy our artists.


  I suppose it doesn't help that Cliff, Jack, and I have been planting them
all over Steve Garofalo's office and desk...  But such is life!

Damn, how time flies :)

Just dropping a quick line to let anyone who cares know about this:

Zach Stroum, who used to write/draw Etherlife (online comic) has now revealed
his new master plan (<a href="http://www.shaw-island.com/">Shaw Island</a>) for
everyone's reading pleasure :)  So drop by and let him know what you think!

 Could someone please ask Roger Waters to make a new album?  Amused to Death is
just so damn amazing, I would kill for something new from him.  

For those of you that were interested in the tattoo I got, here's a <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~mobius/tattoo.htm">URL</a>.

 Not going to mention a company name, as I don't want to get hit with a
libel suit any time soon, but I ordered a bunch of system hardware last week
to build myself a P3/1ghz for home, and a few days ago they called to verify
that I am indeed the person on the credit card and that I did order the parts,
and then told me that it was ready and would be shipping out in the next day
or two.  Today I get to work and I see the large box of parts waiting for me
at my desk.  I open it up, looking forward to putting the damn thing together
and having myself a home system for the first time in like 6 months.  I pull
out the invoice and what do I find but that someone had marked out the ship
quantity for the processor with a ballpoint pen and scratched it into the realm
of backorder!  ARRGH!  Now, I've done ALOT of ordering computer hardware over the
internet, and never had much of a problem with things being put on backorder, as
I do understand that there isn't an unlimited supply of everything, and sometimes
I'm just going to have to wait for what I want, but any OTHER time I've ordered
something that wasn't in stock, the companies have emailed me and let me know
that the parts weren't available and asked me if I wanted to a) cancel the order,
b) substitute for another part, or c) wait for the part to come in.  I wouldn't
be so upset at *this company* if they'd had the courtesy to do that.  I suppose
I'm also pissed because I have worked in inventory control, and I know how to
read an invoice... This one says that they showed it in their inventory, and 
someone either couldn't find it, decided not to TRY and find it, or wanted one
for themselves and decided now would be a good time to fudge an order.

 My last worry is that since this invoice is computer printed, and the funds have
already been deducted from my account, that *the company* very likely shows in
their records that they already sent me my damn P3/1ghz CPU and my DVD drive
and I'm going to get to have a nice big battle with them over the phone...

Sigh.

  SSX for PSX2 RULES!  I haven't ever been much of a sports game player, but
this is one spectacular game!  The courses are incredible, the amount of stuff
to unlock is daunting, the controls are kickass, and the game is overall fun
to play!

 In other news, I got a new tattoo for my birthday, and the artist did a really
damn good job.  Those of you in the Raleigh area who might be interested in a 
tattoo, the artist is:

Hunter Spanks

at

Start 2 Finish Tattoo
3999 Hillsborough St

Its very close to I-440.

  Well, another year gone by, and still I don't *feel* old, though some people
may disagree and say I'm much too old already (at least where musical taste is
concerned).  My birthday is tomorrow (yes, my birthday really is Halloween) and
I've decided that for the very first time, I'm not doing anything, no party, no
travelling to see relatives, no cake.  May sound boring, but remember, since I'm
turning 26, that means I've had 25 birthday parties already, some of them
involving a 16 hour round trip drive back to Birmingham to spend it with my
parents.  This is much less stressful :)

  In other news, we finally got our real office furniture, which might not sound
very exciting to anyone else, but since we've spent the last 2+ years working on
folding tables in white rooms (most of us, at least), this is a HUGE change!  
Shane, Cliff and I spent a few days taking our stuff down and painting, so now we
have a very nicely appointed office to walk in to every day.  Check the webcams
(Cliff and I both have one) to catch a glimpse of the new decor.

Crunch mode.... sigh.

In other news, Cliff and I did a fun interview together... Think deathmatch
with words!  Check it at <a href="http://www.3dactionplanet.com/features/interviews/duel/">3D Action Planet</a> and see my horrible pictures.

And finally (and I know I'm prob. going to regret this) my webcam exists at <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~mobius/campics/webcam">this
link</a> so anyone who's interested is more than welcome to drop in and check it
out.  I leave it up 24/7 (provided the machine its running on doesn't do anything
totally stupid, which it is prone to do) and I'm planning on making the streaming
link available soon.

 Just found that I'm STILL paying for an old Allegiance account... Is it me, or
is it almost impossible to find where to cancel a zone account?  I ended up
following links all the way back to Microsoft's main web pages to find a 
FAQ that even mentioned the possibility of daring to dream of cancelling
your billing account... Argh.  For anyone who needs to know, you have to
go to the Zone site for each individual game you are paying for, and cancel
your subscription for that particular game.

 Wow, <a href="http://www.runegame.com">RuneGame</a> just went live, and it rocks!  The HH guys should be damn
proud of it... Rune is one of the games that I'm looking forward to, and this
gives the anticipation an even finer edge :)
