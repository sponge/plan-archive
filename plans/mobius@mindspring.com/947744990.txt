Legals would have gone here if I had spent many years
in college to be a lawyer.  As, however, I have not done that, this
is not a valid statement of Epic Games.

  Anyone who's interested in a new/old way to play Unreal/UT should check out this:

Eavy's DarkMatch is a REALLY cool way to run around in the dark hoping you'll kill
someone :)

Remember, not being seen is as important as seeing!

 The new UT patch (405b) was released today, pick it up at your favorite UT website.
It is COMPLETELY network compatible with previous versions of UT, so never fear, if
you don't download it and your favorite server does (or vice versa) you will still 
be able to connect and play!

  Rather than make a long boring post about some lame thing I found on the web,
I'll just say this:

 The long wait for the release of those free maps we mentioned awhile back
WILL BE worth it.  

 'Nuff said.

 Happy birthday to Ross K. Jacobs, who turned 25 today.

 Having read some of the recent reviews of UT and Q3A, I have noticed one 
fairly serious misconception which has been floating around for quite
awhile now...

 Ping, the latency between two computers on a network, either WAN (internet)
or LAN, is a measurement of network connection response, NOT of the efficiency
of a program's network code (other than TCP/IP itself).  The correct measurement
of a game's network code is in how well it deals with high or low pings.  The
game in no way causes high or low ping, it is totally dependent of your connection
to the internet, the server's connection to the internet, and all the systems between
you (the client) and the server.

 This means that if you play any game on a server with a ping over 250 or so, and it plays
well, that game has good network code.  If you play a game on a server with the same ping,
but the gameplay is laggy, stutters, or is downright unplayable due to connection
problems, the netcode for that game is not quite up to snuff.

 Also, some games calculate ping differently (don't ask me how, I ain't no programmer!)
so even that simple number is really only a general idea of how good your CONNECTION TO
THE INTERNET is.

 Merry Christmas to all!  In honor of the holiday, I just wanted to throw out
a quick line of cheer and goodwill to all.

Or as my mother would say (and often has):

 Remember, the bigger the pile, the brighter the smile!

 I've been reading alot of online comics lately, and I just wanted to complement
the author/artists who do them!  

www.etherlife.net > Zach Stroum, really blows my mind... *groan*

www.penny-arcade.com > If you've never been there, you're truly missing out!  I
 am totally looking forward to their Christmas Carol interpretation!

www.sluggy.com > Oh god, sheer mayhem!  This is one of the strangest and most oddball
 comics I've read ever... A mini-lop with a switchblade?

www.herdthinners.com > Much fun to read, more along the lines of traditional 
 newspaper comics.  Innocent and funny.

Happy Holidays to everyone!

Playing Planescape:Torment, and I have to say, the story is very very good. I've 
been an RPG'er for a long time now, pen and paper, digital, whatever, and this one
has a very good feel to it.

 Ok, so I'm looking for something.  I have a Laser FX(tm) Light show thingy, one of
those things that does a pattern on the ceiling/wall that responds to music. I got it
as a gift quite a few years ago, and I know it was purchased at Spencer Gifts.  Now,
what I am looking for is the upgraded model, which has 2 light array thingys on a 
single pedestal and can take a stereo input.  Any info anyone can dig up on this
would be greatly appreciated. There is a tag on the bottom of mine that says it was
manufactured by the Samil Enterprise Co., LTD: part # SF-102.

Anyone who can find me the upgraded version will be my best friend :)

Email anything you can find to alan@epicgames.com

UT being done and all, I thought I'd leave a quick message here and thank all
the people who put faith in me and taught me the skillz I use today.

In no specific order:

Jay D. for being very patient with someone who forgot to add startpoints to Doom maps!

Ross J. for all those late night co-op Doom games :)

Kevin F. Viva!

My parents, for letting me live in the garage for some months being a bum and sitting
at the computer 24-7

Melanie B. though I know she'll probably never see this, for putting up with me without
a job

Doran G. for running that bad boy

id Software for making level design-able games

Shane C. for making an offer in an airport. (get your mind outta the gutter.)

Cliff B. for putting up and only very occasionally shutting up!

Tim S. for being a genius

Brandon R. for being angry :)

If I forgot anyone, I'm sorry. If you didn't want to be on this list, I'm sorry.  If
you demand to be on this list, go to hell.


Holy S**t, we did it...

10-22-99***(EARLY morning)

  James Green, Jack Porter, and myself went down to the loading dock and played
some 'street' style hockey... Alright, I wasn't wearing rollerblades, and we
didn't play for a score or anything, but I am nice and sore and out of breath (quitting
smoking three months ago is the only reason I even survived tonight!), but we had
a good time acting like complete fools in front of the security camera.  In more
directly work related news, the programmers are squashing bugs like madmen, and 
the level designers are finished with all their known stuff.  While it feels 
REALLY nice to be at the end of this project, I can't seem to relax yet, and I
don't think I'm going to until I actually SEE it for myself in stores.

  Those of you who have been to Epic's offices here would truly NOT recognise the
place at the moment... Cliff and I share an office, and we've been going a little nuts
decorating it this week (not for Halloween or anything, just finally got up the energy
to go and do what we've been talking about for awhile) and now our office is very...
ummm eccentrically lit.  The disco balls are interesting, but I think the 
blacklites and the fog machine really give it that extra 'Umph'.  Think I'm kidding?
Take a look. <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~mobius/officepic.jpg">Here.</a> Its been awhile since I've done any html, so forgive
me if this is badly done. Our little corner of the world now looks like a bad club.

A very bad club.

  WE NEED SERVERS :) We have more players than servers right now, so EVERYONE who can
run servers!  (obviously the higher your bandwidth, the better!)


  Cliff Bleszinski is a punk ass bitch.  He apparently doesn't feel it necessary to
mention all the SMACK DOWNS he's received in Insta-Gib... He can't Shock Rifle
