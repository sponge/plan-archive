 Just a brief mention of current events in my life...

Sometime this month (I think) will mark the 6 month anniversary of my having
quit smoking.  Most of the other times I have quit I've known to the day how
long it's been... but this time I haven't really cared to keep track.  Good
sign maybe?  Hope so.

On October 19th, 2001, I got married (to a human female, no less!).

On September 28th, I bought my first home.

September 19th marked the 3 year anniversary of my moving to Raleigh to
work with Epic Games.  I had been hired slightly before then, but that's the
date that I moved into my apartment.

There's the big news in my life, both these events have radically affected
my perception of the world (not to mention I was sitting with the
realtor in what is now my living room on the morning of the 11th, while the
inspection of the house was going on, watching events unfold on someone
else's television on someone else's couch).

Methinks 2002 is going to be quite interesting.

Happy Birthday to me, I turn 27 today.

Yes, once again its Halloween, my favorite holiday and birthday.
I wish everyone a safe and totally enjoyable holiday!
