Legals would have gone here if I had spent many years
in college to be a lawyer.  As, however, I have not done that, this
is not a valid statement of Epic Games.

 Happy birthday to Ross K. Jacobs, who turned 25 today.

 Having read some of the recent reviews of UT and Q3A, I have noticed one 
fairly serious misconception which has been floating around for quite
awhile now...

 Ping, the latency between two computers on a network, either WAN (internet)
or LAN, is a measurement of network connection response, NOT of the efficiency
of a program's network code (other than TCP/IP itself).  The correct measurement
of a game's network code is in how well it deals with high or low pings.  The
game in no way causes high or low ping, it is totally dependent of your connection
to the internet, the server's connection to the internet, and all the systems between
you (the client) and the server.

 This means that if you play any game on a server with a ping over 250 or so, and it plays
well, that game has good network code.  If you play a game on a server with the same ping,
but the gameplay is laggy, stutters, or is downright unplayable due to connection
problems, the netcode for that game is not quite up to snuff.

 Also, some games calculate ping differently (don't ask me how, I ain't no programmer!)
so even that simple number is really only a general idea of how good your CONNECTION TO
THE INTERNET is.

 Merry Christmas to all!  In honor of the holiday, I just wanted to throw out
a quick line of cheer and goodwill to all.

Or as my mother would say (and often has):

 Remember, the bigger the pile, the brighter the smile!

 I've been reading alot of online comics lately, and I just wanted to complement
the author/artists who do them!  

www.etherlife.net > Zach Stroum, really blows my mind... *groan*

www.penny-arcade.com > If you've never been there, you're truly missing out!  I
 am totally looking forward to their Christmas Carol interpretation!

www.sluggy.com > Oh god, sheer mayhem!  This is one of the strangest and most oddball
 comics I've read ever... A mini-lop with a switchblade?

www.herdthinners.com > Much fun to read, more along the lines of traditional 
 newspaper comics.  Innocent and funny.

Happy Holidays to everyone!

Playing Planescape:Torment, and I have to say, the story is very very good. I've 
been an RPG'er for a long time now, pen and paper, digital, whatever, and this one
has a very good feel to it.

 Ok, so I'm looking for something.  I have a Laser FX(tm) Light show thingy, one of
those things that does a pattern on the ceiling/wall that responds to music. I got it
as a gift quite a few years ago, and I know it was purchased at Spencer Gifts.  Now,
what I am looking for is the upgraded model, which has 2 light array thingys on a 
single pedestal and can take a stereo input.  Any info anyone can dig up on this
would be greatly appreciated. There is a tag on the bottom of mine that says it was
manufactured by the Samil Enterprise Co., LTD: part # SF-102.

Anyone who can find me the upgraded version will be my best friend :)

Email anything you can find to alan@epicgames.com

UT being done and all, I thought I'd leave a quick message here and thank all
the people who put faith in me and taught me the skillz I use today.

In no specific order:

Jay D. for being very patient with someone who forgot to add startpoints to Doom maps!

Ross J. for all those late night co-op Doom games :)

Kevin F. Viva!

My parents, for letting me live in the garage for some months being a bum and sitting
at the computer 24-7

Melanie B. though I know she'll probably never see this, for putting up with me without
a job

Doran G. for running that bad boy

id Software for making level design-able games

Shane C. for making an offer in an airport. (get your mind outta the gutter.)

Cliff B. for putting up and only very occasionally shutting up!

Tim S. for being a genius

Brandon R. for being angry :)

If I forgot anyone, I'm sorry. If you didn't want to be on this list, I'm sorry.  If
you demand to be on this list, go to hell.


Holy S**t, we did it...

10-22-99***(EARLY morning)

  James Green, Jack Porter, and myself went down to the loading dock and played
some 'street' style hockey... Alright, I wasn't wearing rollerblades, and we
didn't play for a score or anything, but I am nice and sore and out of breath (quitting
smoking three months ago is the only reason I even survived tonight!), but we had
a good time acting like complete fools in front of the security camera.  In more
directly work related news, the programmers are squashing bugs like madmen, and 
the level designers are finished with all their known stuff.  While it feels 
REALLY nice to be at the end of this project, I can't seem to relax yet, and I
don't think I'm going to until I actually SEE it for myself in stores.

  Those of you who have been to Epic's offices here would truly NOT recognise the
place at the moment... Cliff and I share an office, and we've been going a little nuts
decorating it this week (not for Halloween or anything, just finally got up the energy
to go and do what we've been talking about for awhile) and now our office is very...
ummm eccentrically lit.  The disco balls are interesting, but I think the 
blacklites and the fog machine really give it that extra 'Umph'.  Think I'm kidding?
Take a look. <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~mobius/officepic.jpg">Here.</a> Its been awhile since I've done any html, so forgive
me if this is badly done. Our little corner of the world now looks like a bad club.

A very bad club.

  WE NEED SERVERS :) We have more players than servers right now, so EVERYONE who can
run servers!  (obviously the higher your bandwidth, the better!)

  Well, 'Private' Greenmarine obviously just doesn't know how to make an
effective assault against a superior force. Superior in intellect and in
architecture! Heheh. We had a big discussion last night, and we've basically
agreed that the first units that Cavedog releases for Kingdoms have to do
something to balance Zhon... Zhon being all that I play, so I can do a very
quick build to harpy-dom :)

 Kingdoms and Mechwarrior 3 both kick much ass!  I've been tinkering around
with both of them as time permits, so I've not gotten very far in the single
player aspects of either, but when I do play, I'm loving it!  Whipped up a 
TA:K map over the last two nights, and emailed it to some of the Kingdoms
sites, so it may pop up on a few of them in the next few days.

 I also plan on starting Thomas Harris' 'Hannibal' today sometime, though I'm
not sure that's such a good thing!  The last thing I read by Stephen King was
his review of this book, and unfortunately got hit by a van.  That does not
bode well.

06-16-99***

 Just to clarify a bit:

	James' post on the UnrealTournament.net site does NOT mean the game
is done! It just means that we've locked down on all revisions of code
not necessary to bugfixes.  This means we could still have a few weeks or
more of testing and revisions before we can properly go gold.  Which we are
not now, again, we are NOT done with UT, nor have we gone gold.

Just a quick update to thank all the people in #unrealed on gameslink.net
for trying to help me find DmScruular, an old map of mine... I got it now!

  - - - Warning! Long rant ahead! - - -

 I've been doing some thinking on the state of the industry alot lately, and
I've gone over and over it in my head, and I can't figure out why we (the general
we, not Epic) are so interested in the so-called Ion-Gate scandal... Its not MY
company, and its not my games that are being delayed by it...  While I have up
till now been avidly watching BitchX, OldManMurray, and Flamethrower dig up the
data on everything happening in the Ion offices, I've come to the realization that
I don't really WANT to know everything that happens behind their doors.  They are
a company that obviously has problems dealing with the press in regards to their
business decisions, and everyone who've left there whose opinions I have read have
not had good things to say, but ITS NONE OF MY BUSINESS!  Unless I was to go to
Ion Storm and apply for a job, I don't need to know what they're doing in a business
sense.  Now, I do agree that there are lots of reasons for the prospective employee
of a company to want/need information on the business practises of an employer, 
so that said prospective employee can make an informed decision on who s/he wants
to push the hardest to gain employment with.  BUT. I do not think it is right that
quite so much gloating and general vulture (vulpine?) behavior is being evidenced
over the internal rumblings of a company that's not saying a word about their
rumoured squabbles, true or not.  What it comes down to for me, as a consumer of
their product, and only as that, is do I enjoy the game?  I'll find that out when
I play the full versions of Daikatana and Anachronox.  I enjoyed what I saw of it
at E3, and the same it true of Anachronox (though being a long time RPG fan, I'd
probably buy Anachronox first, given the chance).  I'm going to try and act a
little more respectfully and not pry so much into the affairs of a company that I
have no legitimate business prying into.

 For all those guys in #unrealed... Groan.

05-21-99***

 Well, back in the office now after E3... Spent some time with my folks after
E3, went and saw Star Wars with my Dad, which was really cool! Needless to say
I thought Star Wars was extremely good, as a matter of fact Pancho and I have
been reminiscing (sp?) about the movie all day, and quoting our favorite bits.

 Back at work today, and it feels REALLY good... I've been out of the office since
the 10th, so its really nice to sit and check my email (all 178 of them) and see
whats been happening in the world.

Well, not much of an update, but there you go, I'm a boring kinda guy.

 - Alan

05-17-99(later)***
(realized that i was using the date and the time zone, but no time. Doh!)

Just wanted to add in here that not only did Rune rock, but so did Deus Ex.
They've got some truly cool shit in there.

 - Alan

05-17-99***

WOW!  E3 was just freakin' incredible!  We all had a great time, got to look at
almost everything we wanted to, and had some free drinks and snacks here and
there to boot!  The only thing I hate about post-E3 is now I have to wait 3-6
months to play all those really cool games again! Had alot of fun meeting some of
the licensees, and getting to demo UT to the public.  The positive reaction we got
from everyone who played it was truly heartwarming, and I'd like to thank everyone
who came by the booth for all your positive comments.

p.s. Rune is going to kick serious ass.

 - Alan 

05-10-99EST***

  Well, we had one hell of a blast last night, what with all the webmasters here!
Evil Avatar, Apache, Arcane, Billy 'Wicked' Wilson, Mia'cova, and Dark Viper it was
a pleasure having you all here, and hearing your ideas on the game surely has inspired
us to even greater heights!  

  To all those who will be attending E3 this year, feel free to drop by the booth and 
drop your greets off!  We'll be at the booths from time to time, I'm sure! I'll be out
of here tomorrow, heading to the old homestead to spend some time with my folks before
jetting to LA for the event.  Its going to be very strange watching people play with
our toy! I got such a great feeling yesterday watching all those people play UT and
enjoy it!

till then.
