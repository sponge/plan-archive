Legals would have gone here if I had spent many years
in college to be a lawyer.  As, however, I have not done that, this
is not a valid statement of Epic Games.

 FINALLY!  Its out, after a long testing process :)  The Bonus Pack is out, and
can be found at your favorite news site by now I hope.  Just a bit of a secret
got shipped with this... If you rename DM-Cybrosis][ to DOM-Cybrosis][, the map
will play as a Domination map, with named control points and the works!  I
figured if I slipped the Control Points in like this, it would save a little
bit on the download size, so go forth and enjoy.

(p.s. Just noticed I've been putting the wrong year on my updates since the middle
of January. Duh!)

 Wow :)  Got quite the response there... As an update, I'm still having the same
problem, so I've decided for the moment to just live with having a PS2 mouse doing
nothing.  

 On another front, I'm searching for a pet, and I was wondering if anyone out there
knows where I can find a breeder of African Grey (pref. Congo, not Timneh) that is
local to Raleigh, NC, who sells hand-weaned baby parrots.  I've been considering this
for some time now, and I've decided its time for me to get another parrot!  Any 
reasonable, intelligent replies are much appreciated @ alan@epicgames.com. 

 And yet another question:  Does anyone out there have the correct pinout to connect
an Adaptive BetaBrite LED sign to a PC using an RJ12 - RS232 9pin cable, and the
protocol specs to communicate with it?

 Been awhile :)

 Brandon, my girlfriend and I went and saw Chevelle, Dope, Static-X and Powerman 5000
perform at the Ritz here in Raleigh Sunday, and I have to say, it was one hell of a
show!  Chevelle was good, Dope was really good, Powerman was damn good, but I'd have
to say (and I'm sure Brandon would agree) that Static-X stole the show, at least for
us. They put on an incredible show, played an unreleased song, and in general shook
the house HARD.  If they happen to be coming anywhere near you, I recommend catching
the show highly if you're into that type of music.  

 On the office front, several of us just upgraded to Athlon 800s this week, and
since I'm the one that built the systems, I seem to be the one expected to fix any
possible problems with them.  The only unexplainable problem I've run into is this:

 I installed Win98 with a PS2 mouse installed, since a USB wouldn't be any good until
the operating system was up and going, and once I had everything ready, I installed my
Razer Boomslang 2000.  Now this was great until I rebooted.  Now everytime the system
boots with just the USB mouse installed, Windows locks up hard before it gets anywhere
NEAR completion. It locks up so early that I couldn't even get into safe mode or a
command prompt.  Now I figured out a workaround by having a PS2 mouse attached but
tossed into a corner, and this has worked on all three systems I built.  I'm wondering
if anyone out there has had a similar problem, or knows of a workaround or fix that
doesn't require that I leave this PS2 mouse attached since I'm not using it and it
seems somewhat silly to have it attached.  Email me @ alan@epicgames.com if you have
any useful advice.  I have flashed my BIOS to the latest version, which is supposed
to add Athlon 800 compatibility (wasn't having any other problems before though), and
I've installed all the custom Motherboard drivers included with the MB (a Microstar
MS-6167 Irongate), and nothing seems to have made a difference.

 Anticipation grows within me... I sense an evil looming over the horizon,
bloated and grotesque, and the glow of its red eyes shines down upon a blasted,
wretched landscape.

 Diablo 2 approaches, and I better damn well get the copy I reserved.  

On a lighter note, Raleigh has been getting tons (relatively) of snow this last week,
and I'm enjoying it an amazing amount, and I've had more fun watching people fail to
drive from my office window.  Especially amusing was one van attempting to leave the 
loading dock Monday morning.  People, don't try to drive up short, steep, curving hills
in a minivan with no spikes or chains in snowy, icy weather!

ATTENTION!!!  The recent 405B patch is NOT a beta!  Apparently people have been getting
the wrong idea that this is a BETA patch, based on the 'B' in the version number.  This 
is not so!  This patch is as finalized as the 402 patch was.  While the patches haven't
gone through the same extremely intensive testing as the release version of the game, we do
extensively test them both internally and with an external group of beta testers before 
releasing them. 

And no, don't email me asking how to be a beta tester!!!!!!!!

  Anyone who's interested in a new/old way to play Unreal/UT should check out this:

Eavy's DarkMatch is a REALLY cool way to run around in the dark hoping you'll kill
someone :)

Remember, not being seen is as important as seeing!

 The new UT patch (405b) was released today, pick it up at your favorite UT website.
It is COMPLETELY network compatible with previous versions of UT, so never fear, if
you don't download it and your favorite server does (or vice versa) you will still 
be able to connect and play!

  Rather than make a long boring post about some lame thing I found on the web,
I'll just say this:

 The long wait for the release of those free maps we mentioned awhile back
WILL BE worth it.  

 'Nuff said.
