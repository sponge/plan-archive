TEAM EVOLVE IS HIRING!!!
We are currently looking for a few good men.  We have an upcomming project
that requires an extra mapper or two who are good with Q3Radiant, scripting,
etc..  

If you want to break into the gaming biz, shoot me an email with some URL's to
your previous work and we'll go from there.
