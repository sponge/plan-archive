Every now and again I have to put out the word when I find a game that 
just really impresses me. In this instance it's more like an addiction!

For anyone out there that owns a Dreamcast, you really should
buy Virtua Tennis! By far the best deathmatch game I've played in ages.
This isn't so much a sports game as a tennis RPG. It's a bit like crack
really! At Gearbox at least seven people have bought a copy and we are
very hooked.

Just read the Daily Radar review:

Enjoy!
