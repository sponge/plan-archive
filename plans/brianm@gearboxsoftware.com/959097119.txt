Congratulations to the entire Massive team!

Good job guys!

And next time I see you guys we'll have a few drinks together!

Until then SKAL!

And for anyone who has not had a chance to play the demo I highly recommend you try it out 
until you get a chance to buy the full game. This is by far the best and most original 
solution for realtime 3D strategy games. Anyone out there making one learn from these guys 
it's an excellent system!
