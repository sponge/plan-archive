Hey all,
	Ok I hope this doesnt come off the wrong way.  If anyone wants to come and play death match on Ravens Meatwagon server expect the 
worst.  The guys around here have been playing and testing and playing for a while now so right off the bat we have an advantage.  Advantage 
#2: Were all playing locally so the lag is VERY minimal, for us on that server the game runs like grease lightning.  On all the other servers 
I play I try new things, watch others play, and I have fun.  But on Mwagon its all about taking care of our house and last night I was playing 
with about six other people and I hit the server limit which was set at 35 and the closest person to me was at nine.  Now Im not even close to 
being one of our better players.  So if your interested in just trying out the game, trying to familiarize yourself with the controls, or you 
want a fun friendly game there are a ton of servers out there, go to them.  There are a lot of people that come to Mwagon and beat us, and 
thats great!  I just dont want to discourage anyone who is new to this sort of fighting, thats all.  So like I said I hope this doesnt come 
off the wrong way, I dont want anyone to think that Im saying that were better or anything stupid like that, all Im saying is that we have 
a few advantages.  Hats off to Duff, he/she was pushing a few of us around our own game a couple of days ago.
	Animations have been cut off OFFICALLY today.  So no new animations for any creatures from here on in.  Tweaks are still allowed for a 
few more days but that to will soon be capped as well.  The end is in sight!  Now the major issue is the fun factor.  Play, Play, PLAY!

Im glad to see such a positive reaction to Heretic2.  Everyone here is very appreciative of all the nice things people have had to say and I 
also want to say thanks to all the people that are sending in bugs and suggestion that theyve found while playing the demo.  Weve gotten a 
lot of great ideas, obviously we wont be able to add everything this late in the schedule but were doing out best.  Its very difficult to 
try and get work done ever since the demo was released.  Everyones been playing and the laughter and enjoyment through out the building has 
been very contagious.  It takes all I can do to put my headphones on and turn up the volume and work.  Everyone is really hooked on the death 
matching end of H2 right now but let me tell you, single player is SSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO submerging.  Very cinematic and very well paced.  Ive 
only played a select few games that when Ive been three quarters of the way through Im still as excited as I was at the beginning.  I think 
thats the beauty of H2, the game is very story based so as you play through it, it becomes more and more interesting and enticing.  H2 is a 
lights out, friends over, cold beer type on game.
	I picked up the Frank Frazetta Icon book last night and one word comes to mind, Incredible!  The guy is absolutely amazing.  Back when 
Frank allowed Danzig to get his hands on the Death Dealer and put out a comic I was extremely disappointed!  I bought the first one and vowed 
never again, Glen had completely missed the whole essence behind this character, or on the other hand my whole perception of what the death 
dealer was all about was wrong.  Either way I hated it and I was very disappointed in the loss of one of my favorite images.  But then last 
night I read page 158 of the Icon book and I wanted to stand up and cheer!  And I Quote, "Reveling in its imagery of severed limbs, fountains 
of blood, and subjugated nude werewomen, Verotiks interpretation quite simply misunderstood Frazettaa art, intent, and character:  Danzig and 
his artists responded personally and viscerally to their source material, totally missing the intellect behind Franks work."  Frank also when 
to say, "My figures are muscular, but for chrissake, theyre not ridiculous.  And despite the violence in my art I want people to look at it 
and say, `Its beautiful!` and forget about the situation.  I want them to look at it for the sheer beauty and symmetry and the wonderful shapes 
and color and rhythm, and thats all they see.  They dont think about the fact its a battle scene.  Its taste that separates the men from the 
boys.  These kids are drawing the super merry Marvel characters hacking each other to bits and rubbing your nose in the gore and pretending 
thats  the way I would do it.  Theyre wrong."
	So Ill end on that.

Alright were just a few weeks off and everyones excited.  Theres been a lot of late nights and all nighters lately trying to tie all this stuff 
together.  I know my "to do" list is a lot longer that I want it to be.  When we started this little project I remember everyone was all bent out of 
shape because we werent offering Heretic2 in first person, that quieted down over the last few months but lately Ive started to hear that again.  
Well I was playing one of the games that everyone seems to compare Heretic2 with the other day and I absolutely realize what people are worried about. 
Tomb Raider can get soooooooooooooooooooo frustrating!  Ive been playing H2 so much for the past few months that I had forgotten what the control 
elements of Tomb Raider were like, YUCK!  Not that Im dogging TR, I really like the first one but now I just cant play it.  Its painful to try and 
move threw the world and thats when it hit me, if thats what people are expecting then I dont blame them for being disgruntled!  Im here to say 
dont judge it until youve tried it.  TRUST ME!

Mr. Bobby keeps bringing up stats, stats, and more stats but the one statistic he seems to always over look is the fact that Marino was never good 
enough to bring home a ring.  Favre has thrown over thirty touchdowns how many years in a row?  How many times has Danny boy done it?  The only 
thing that Marino has over Brett is time and that looks to be in Favres favor.  Dan Marino wasnt even the best quarterback of his day, he ALWAYS 
took a back seat to a guy who had about one third of Marinos talent but this guy was a winner.  Joe Montana defined winning and its a chapter 
Marino never bothered to read.  Dont you think Danny would trade all his little breakable records (and as we all know every record ever made is 
breakable) for the one thing no one could ever take away from him, like a Superbowl Championship?  You bet your ass he would.  1984 was a 
incredible year for records, I think that was the year Eric Dickerson rushed for over two thousand yards for the Rams but you dont see anyone 
saying hes the greatest because on one stellar year.  Winners win games, Losers chalk up stats and try and talk about how good they were.  
	Now Mr. Bobby is trying to talk about the Dolphins nonexistent running game by bringing up people who havent amounted to squat!  
Karim isnt even the best athlete with that name.  Why do you think Phillips is there in the first place?  Because Karim cant get the job done!  
And now Phillips sucks too!  These are two guys that everyone (including myself) thought would explode when they came into the league but 
nnnnnnooooooooooooooooooo.  Theyre B class backs at best.  Parmalee does have flashes of greatness but hes about as predictable as a tornado.  
I sure as hell wouldnt want to have to count on him week in and week out, and obviously ether does JJ because hes always looking for a new 
running backs.  Kitts?  Who the hell is this guy?  Nealy?  Is he related to someone on the coaching staff?  Pritchett?  Isnt he dead?  The 
Dolphins barrel of backs is more like a barrel of monkeys.  And I also see that Mr. Bobby is questioning the Harris deal Green Bay locked down 
the other day, the funny thing is the Dolphins wanted him pretty bad.  And he signed with the Pack for less money, why you ask.  BECAUSE HE 
DOSENT WANT TO END UP LIKE MARINO!  Old, crabby and living in the past.  The eighties are over bobby and so is Dannys career.  
	Favre is the Barry Sanders of quarterbacks and he can beat you by himself.  When Jimmy Johnson said that there were handfuls of 
quarterbacks in the league better that Marino who did he single out as the one hed love to have?  FAVRE!
	Now that Im done ranting and raving about that Heretic2 is still on schedule to be released next year.  Just kidding.  This bad boy 
will be on time or my names not Quisp!

	Bobby D is either smoking crack or hes lost all grips on football as we know it.  Let me start out by saying that the man who has 
slanderously bashed my beloved packers is the same man who owes me a six pack of good beer and hes not paying up.  And the reason Mr. Duncanson
owes me this prize is because we made a little wager about the has been Dolphins and I undoubtedly won.  Last season Bobby was boasting about 
Jimmy Johnsons three year plan to take Floridas worst team to the Superbowl and I said theyd do no better than 10 and 6.  Well I should be 
enjoying some nice chilled Turbo Dog right now but nnnnooooooooo, Mr. Bobby doesnt seem like the type who likes to pay up when his mighty 
Dolphins swim belly up.  This is Jimmys final year of his lame ass three year prediction and guess what, I wouldnt be surprised one bit if 
they dont even make the playoffs.  And they surly wont win the big one with that old crusty armed Marino at quarterback!  Marino was a great 
quarterback in his day, but he wasnt even close to being the best in the game then and honestly now hes maybe a good back up for over half 
the teams in the league.  If Bobby wants to put his money were is mouth is then lets go double or nothing that either Green Bay does better 
than the Dolphins this year or that Jimmy Johnsons prediction of making to the Superbowl this year was a lot of cheap talk.  What do you say 
Bobby?
	I stand by my predictions and even though I dont like Dallas at all I still think theyre one of the most talented teams in the league 
and should be a wildcard team.  I dont care how old everyone is, Troy is easily the best quarterback in his division and this year Dallas 
will have a running game.  Green Bays offense this year will be better than any recent year and the only reason that Favre doesnt throw fifty 
touchdowns this season is because the pack will have a running game and that will take away from Brett a little.  But hell still throw over 
thirty.  The people Green Bay lost were over rated and over paid, the real losers are Carolina and San Francisco.  The Jets might now win their 
division but with Martin running the ball and the new (old) uniforms the Jets are playoff bound.
Oh yea, the games still going well.

	The model for my last (scheduled) creature is done and Im about halfway threw the set up stage, this guy should be moving later 
today or tomorrow.  After this its tweaks and extra animations.  This last creatures poly count was at 299, which isnt great but we 
should be able to fill up a room and not take too much of a speed hit.  SPEED, SPEED, SPEED, thats all I hear now a days and this time 
its not coming from Bob Loves area.  With the way our techniques on modeling and texturing have changed since the beginning of the project 
I almost want to go back to the first couple of creatures that we did and redo them.  I guess in the end it wont really make that much of a 
difference but if I do find myself with a couple extra days well see what happens.  Eric Turman came up with a unique way of modeling that 
lets the models have more volume, better deformation, and a lower poly count.  I know it doesnt sound like it would add up but after he 
showed me how he did it, it made all the sense in the world.  We on average have cut about one hundred and fifty polys per creature and they 
look so much fuller and theyre not box creatures anymore.   Way to go Eric!  
	Other than that not too much else is happening.  Day by day the game is coming a little closer to finishing, I look forward to testing 
time.  I just hope the box looks cool.  Theres nothing worse that busting your butt on a game for a year (and in some cases longer) and when 
youre done some marketing boy throws it into a box that makes you want to puke!  Aaarrrrrhhhhhh!  I wish we could do the box in house, unless 
BROM is interested of course, other wise let us do it, Nelson, Butler, Long, Dorscheid, Koberstein, Pelletier, and theres more were that came 
from.  
	Green Bay starts their trek back to the Promised Land in a week and a half.  Granted they have to play five preseason games and thats 
just stupid but hey, its FOOTBALL!  Green Bay, Washington, and San Francisco win their divisions and Tampa Bay, Dallas, and believe it or not 
the Cardinals will win wildcard spots.  And in that other crappy league the Jets, Jaguars, and Kansas City win their divisions and Miami, 
Denver, and Pitt or New England are wild.  AND THATS THE BOTTOM LINE!

	Long time no talk.  Things around here are moving along pretty much as planned, the two key words in that sentence 
are pretty much.  But the game is looking GREAT!  Not tooting our own horn but Im really enjoying the small amount of testing 
that Ive been able to do at this point.  The levels are looking fantastic and I think people will be pleasantly surprised 
with the AI of the creatures.   Im starting on a new creature today, that means there are about 2 or 3 left and then its all 
tweaks and refinement.  That to me is very exciting, were going to have about three months of testing and tweaking!  Well be 
adding new anims, tweaking transitions and interaction scenarios, and complex AI decisions.  This is going to hopefully lead us 
up to a unique, intelligent, and bug free gold.  
	I talked to Chaos the other day, he seems to be doing really well. (Just incase any Chaos fans are checking this out.)  
It was good to hear his off kilter laugh again, hes going to be doing some great things down south.  
	I want to thank Bobby Love for exposing my greatest softball weakness to the world.  His little rock throwing characteristic 
isnt all that far from the truth.  AND ITS NOT FUNNY:)!!!  Was anyone else disappointed when they found out what "majoombas" were?  
FEET?!?!?!?!  Thats the best he could come up with?  Would it kill him to let me and Captain Butler have a little fun, would he 
die if he had to let us see something other than FEET?  Thats it?  Thats all hes got?  
	And lastly if anyone has any ideas were I can find a cool Green Lantern desktop theme please let me know.  I would really 
appreciate it.  Well thats all folks.

  						...And when I walk hand in hand with death
						     in the forest of Suicides and she 
						     asks me ever so politely to stay--
								I will refuse.

	Well E3 is here and gone and the buzz seems to be very positive.  At this point the game is not quite half done and 
people are already starting to like it, NICE!  Its very reassuring when your only a about half way in to a project an 
people are already starting to take serious notice.  Like I said before, we wanted to make a game for people who love to 
play games.  Maybe that sounds stupid or obvious but honestly its not, look at all the games out there that take advantage 
of the gamers.  I dont buy near as many games as I used to just because I feel either theyre a cliche of a clichى, or 
people just want to make money off me and to that I say, "Fuck off".  I dont want to sound like a self righteous ass 
because I understand sometimes theres unfair deadlines or individuals are trying new things and they just didnt work, that 
I have no problem with that what so ever!  Experimentation is gutsy, commendable, and refreshing weather you fail or succeed.
But its the people who do the same old thing and expect people to buy into it even more.  Sell the game not the babe! 
	Go Bulls!  Die Jazz!  Enough said.  
	If anyone has seen the Heretic2 demo at E3 and has comment or criticisms please drop me a line, every little bit 
helps!

		I hope everyone had a fantastic Easter!  I had a good day other than the fact I put on about fifty pounds, 
but who can turn down good home cookn?  
	Everything here at Heretic2 headquarters is running smoothly.  Josh Weier and myself are pulling out all the stops 
on a character were working on now.  I wish I could give everyone a little insight but my lips are sealed.  Im guessing if 
it all works out like weve planned it, somebodys going to wet themselves! (Other than Bob that is)  I was running threw a 
few on Fosters and Pinkstons levels and they were magnificent.  I got tired of saying ,"Wow thats rocks!".  So like I 
said, everything is running very smoothly.
	Well thats about it.  Lets just hope the Packers have a good weekend!

	More fears about the 3P camera have seemed to surface.  Some people seem to think that the "chase cam" (impulse 27 
camera) in Hexen 2 is some sort of indication of the kind of camera work that might be used for Heretic 2.  Well you can 
rest assured that in no way, shape, or form does that camera reflect how Heretic 2 will work or react.  The 3P camera was 
put into Hexen 2 for testing purposes and thats it.  It was completely a HACK!  The reason Quake engine 3P cameras have 
been so bad is because no one has tried very hard to implement a 3P camera.  Just because you can get to it doesnt mean 
it was developed for the game to be played that way.  Tomb Raiders camera was developed as a 3P camera, hence it works 
pretty good.  And it was also developed with a puzzle solving game in mind, were developing Heretic2 with an action game 
in mind so trust us, it will be different.  I can completely understand the fear some people have but I dont think you
