Well, we *finally* got the latest version of the Unreal source (v218)
integrated into Deus Ex.  What a pain...this was easily the most
difficult merge yet.  But the upshot is that the editor and the game
load a lot faster and use significantly less memory.  Next, I'm going
to clean up some of our old augmentation and skill code and convert
them to take advantage of some new object functionality that Tim has
added.  Then, I'll be coding all of the real-world weapons for the game.
I'm going to try to talk a little about some of the weapons as I get
them in the game, so keep checking my .plan.

My new Sony 36" XBR Wega should be delivered this week...a friend of mine
just recently got his, and I must say it looks amazing.  Can't wait to
play Metal Gear Solid and Zelda 64 on it...

Speaking of Metal Gear Solid, if you haven't played this game, you must
get it.  It's got to be the best Playstation game yet -- very cinematic
and immersive.  It's got all the gameplay of the original Metal Gear
series and then some.  If only the Playstation's graphics hardware had
more vertex precision and perspective texture mapping...that jittering
drives me nuts!

It sure is nice to finally be writing game code again.  No more merging
and no more fixing other people's bugs.
