Ah...no updates in awhile...sorry.  We've all been really busy working
towards our Alpha 2 milestone.  Been working on more weapons, our skill
and augmentation systems, bugfixes, gameplay tweaks, and tons of gameplay
scripting for the first couple of missions.  We recorded audio for the
first two missions, and I've also been putting in all of the new art
and sound effects.  It's really looking kick ass now, some of the new
maps will just blow people away.  In a few short weeks, you'll be able
to play completely through the first two missions (they will still need
some final tuning and balancing, but for the most part, they'll be
finished.)

Over the next few weeks, Albert and I will be finishing up the scripting
for the first couple of missions.  Albert will also be making sure that
the conversation system is complete and the UI screens rock, and Scott
will be tweaking the new AI that he's been working on.  I'll also be
adding lots of cool little special effects and putting even more sound
and art in the game.

We're also getting ready for our first big E3 appearance...this will be
the first time that we have shown Deus Ex to the public, so if you're
going to be there, come by and see us.  I'm really interested in how
many people actually read these, so if you're reading this right now
and you will be at E3, find me and say 'Hi' (I'll probably be in the
Eidos booth in front of the Deus Ex computers almost the entire show.)
