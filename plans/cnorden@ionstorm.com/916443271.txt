This is just a quick update since I'm really busy with weapons and other
stuff.  I've got almost all of the weapons in the game...they are all
functional and really damn cool.  I'll be finishing those up over the
next couple of weeks.  I've also been working on some misc. scripting
for the designers to help them with some complex door and elevator
functionality.

Check out our first-ever released screenshot in the February issue of PC
Games magazine...it's pretty cool.  Also, check out my latest interview at
http://www.voodooextreme.com/Alteredworlds...I've also given them the
original 1600x1200 screenshot that you saw in the magazine so everybody
can see it at high resolution.

Baldur's Gate and Half-Life kick ass...wish I had more time to play them.
Oh well, back to work...
