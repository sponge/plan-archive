OK...I've been working on the weapons for a bit, and they're looking pretty
cool.  There's a lot of neat things like how the skill system is tied to
your ability to use different types of weapons and how your accuracy is
affected by five or six different factors.  Now, I've stopped working on
the weapons so I could get the travel and world maps working.  They look
pretty cool...I still can't say much about them, but they will give the
player a very unique perspective on the missions and how they all fit
together.

I just got a new 16 meg Banshee card so I can run the game in 1600x1200 and
take beautiful screenshots!  They'll be in a couple of magazines soon, but
I can't tell you which ones or when they will be appearing.  Maybe in a month
or two...heh heh...

BTW, Zelda 64 ROCKS!  Sony Wega TV's ROCK!
