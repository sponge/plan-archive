Ah...vacation.  I'm back from Vegas (hello to Lana - wherever you are -
thanks for making my trip even better.)  Well, we're still waiting on
the final Unreal code update, but I'm going to integrate the 217 build
into our current source so we will already be that far ahead when Tim
releases the "final" code.  Al's currently putting the final touches
on the conversation system editor and getting Christian up to speed
on how to use it to write our convos.  Scott's finishing up our UI
library so he can continue work on our AI.  I'm finishing up some
documentation, doing some web interviews, and integrating new code.

Next up, more cool weapons.  More cool animation enhancements.

Everybody who owns a DVD player must go out this week and buy lots
of DVDs.  Must...destroy....DIVX....

Gonna pick up a new Sony 36" XBR Wega TV in a couple of weeks...if
you haven't seen this set, it is by far the best looking analog TV
in the world.  Perfectly flat screen (horiz. and vert.) and the best
color and detail that I have ever seen.
