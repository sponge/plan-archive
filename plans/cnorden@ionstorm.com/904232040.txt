OK...OK...you can stop bugging me about my lack of .plan updates.
Since I haven't updated in about ten months (yikes!), I'll give a
brief rundown of what's up here (Sorry, I'd rather make a game than
update my .plan every hour, but I'll try to update this at least
every other week.)

Yes, we are using the Unreal engine for Deus Ex.  It rocks!!  This is
the most modular and flexible POV engine that I have ever used (and
yes, I have used many other engines besides Quake)  This is NOT a knock
on Quake (or others), but for our specific game, Unreal suits our needs
much better than the competition (thanks Tim!)

We've been working hard to add all of the extra systems that we need to
the Unreal engine (like conversations, inventory management, player
skills and augmentations, and awesome human figures).  We want to have
as much time as possible to tweak the gameplay to make it as fun as
possible.  We had a great private showing at this year's E3, and we
got an amazing response from the few people that we gave a sneak peek.
Everything is going very well, and everybody on the team is totally
dedicated to making Deus Ex the best RPG that you'll play in 1999.

I can't give out too much information at this point about what I'm doing,
but I'd like input from anybody out there who is reading this as to what
kind of updates you would like to see in my .plan.  I'll try to keep
everybody as up to date as possible as to the status of Deus Ex, but I
can't promise anything, so don't get upset when I won't tell you something.
We have to have some secrets in the game...
