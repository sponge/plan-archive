The time has come to finally clear up some
misconceptions about just how a Rogue .plan
file should be used.

First though, allow me to address your recent
'share' session in which you sullied my reputation.

Jim, it was one frigging Armadillo. Just one.
In the scheme of things, one less armadillo in Louisiana
is...well...like, one less armadillo in Louisiana. 

The Rogue .plan file? It's my understanding that
the .plan file is for relaying important updates and
pertinent information about matters of interest to
the gaming community. Certainly if one wants to air
personal peeves and petty rants that's up to the individual,
but GEEZ buddy...you have stepped (more like, traisped
hither and fro) beyond the line!

Do you really think the Quake community wants to hear
about your most recent self discovery? Isn't it true
that some secrets should remain among us? Jim, there
are young minds among those that 'log on' to gleen
wisdom from our .plan files. We have the awesome
responsibility to shape these minds through our words
and deeds.

Honestly, I have no problem (AT ALL) with your dress
preference. In fact, I know I speak for the rest of
the sixth floor when I say that you spread a bit of
sunshine whenever you wall into a room.

But Jim, in the future, be careful what you confess
in you plan. The rest of the gaming community might not
understand the Jim Molinets we have come to know (and
cover up for) so well.

(Oh wow...cake! There's a birthday party at id.)

I've seen more movies this weekend than
I've seen in all of my life. Geez Petes! When
did THE CINEMA become so doggone expensive.
But that's beside the point. I saw MIB and...
Contact.

MIB? It barely raised a chuckle. Guess I was
expecting too much. Contact? Simply put:
It's awesome! Go see it. Sneak in if ya have to.

It's a given that I have an excessive amount
of 'dreamer' in me, but I was glued to the screen
for the duration. I even whimpered in despair
when the last scene was over. The movie was
better than my favorite dream where I have 
clean socks for every day of the week.
(Wake up, little Stevie. Wake up.) Oh well...it
WAS just a movie, and eventually I did have
to leave the theatre. 

Certainly all the sick realists who 'see' only the
faults in a movie will find their share. The 
'Gump-style' Clinton cameo was the most offensive. 
But if you
