Hmmmm...Rogue's new website has been launched! What ya think?

I like to take this time to thank all that made contributions to
the development and launch of the site. A special thanks goes to
Won Choi and Patrick Magruder. Great work guys!!!

Hey...we have a few job opportunities here at Rogue for energetic 
guys and gals. Check out the Employment Section of the website to find out
who and what we need.

Last, and certainly not least, of the topics on this "oh so long since
it's been updated plan" is that I am utterly, awesomely and just a bit
excited that Rogue Entertainment is working with American McGee and
Electronic Arts to produce 'Alice'. It's gonna be kick ass!

Okay...back to work.
