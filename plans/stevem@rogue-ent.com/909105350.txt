"Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop...etc, on and on and on and on!"
The fire alarm has been tripped at Town East Tower and it's
insane. I haven't seen any smoke so I guess it's safe...
just DAMN annoying.

Went to the Kimball in Fort Worth yesterday, so I figured
I needed to work a bit today. Anyway there was an exhibit of
Late 19th Century/Early 20th Century design. Coolness! (At
least to me.)

Then to the Omni Theatre. Patrick Stewart narrated. (That dude
has a powerful voice, don't he?) The show was great, but don't
be late, 'cause you'll have to sit in the front row. My neck
still aches.

"Whoop, whoop, whoop...."

Then we tooled around in the Science exhibits. Dem bones, dem
Dino bones. It's an 'alien experience' to stand in front of those
monsters, and I love it. They woulda made awesome pets. Think
about it. See, you agree.

"Whoop, whoop, whoop...."

Then we tried our luck at constructing some kinda Dixie Cup (TM),
straw and masking tape flying contraptions in the Kiddoe Exploration
Area. The deal was, you build a flyer with only the stuff on the table
(like MacGyver), then position it over a fan to see how long it stays aloft.

"Whoop, whoop, whoop...."

Laura's concept faired the best. It flew for well over 3 seconds.
It reminded me of an early Da Vinci design, and yet sorta...uh...
er...trailer trashy. Hey, whatever works, right?

My design: 4 inverted 'Cups, positioned at the corners of a square,
connected by straw struts and fastened with masking tape. A technological
marvel. Actually, it looked like the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module)
constructed from items you could find in you glove compartment.
Pretty sad. (Although it was not unlike the real Space Program.)
It worked, the LEM stayed up for a full 2 seconds.

"Whoop, whoop, whoop.....and sirens???"

All in all, it was a great half day. If you have kids take 'em to Fort
Worth. There are ton's o thangs to do, and you'll enjoy it as well.

"Whoop, whoop, whoop, sirens...and firemen?"

Excuse the ramblin'. Have a GREAT 4th!
