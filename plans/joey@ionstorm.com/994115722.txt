Patch 1 is released.  Download and install please.  Fixes
many random crash problems.

Graphical fixes in the patch not in the patch readme:

- Environment mapping supported on low-end cards with
  sorry drivers (glTexGen calls replaced with own
  calculations).

- Polygon z-fighting problems on models, on certain cards
  (especially TNT/TNT2) fixed.

Well, well.  First plan file update in several YEARS.

Anyways, we are done with the patch, but Eidos will not
complete testing until Monday.  My apologies to those
of you who have bought Anachronox but are suffering from
instability issues.  Please bear with us; we don't want
to release a buggy patch.

In the meantime, here are some things you might try, if
you are having problems getting past the initial logo
cinematic:

- If running win2k, install service pack 2.  This is 
  available as an automatic download from Windows Update.

- If running win2k, disable EAX or any other 3D sound.
  You can do this without running Anachronox by running
  SETUPANOX.EXE from the Anachronox install dir.

- If using a voodoo2 or voodoo3 card, make sure that 
  wickedGL's opengl32.dll is copied to the Anachronox
  install dir.

- Install the application under windows 95B or 98 if at
  all possible.

Also, core team members regularly visit the official
Anachronox BBS at www.anachronox.com as well as the
forum on www.planetanachronox.com.  The demo will be
ready sometime after the patch is released.
