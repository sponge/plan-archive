============ 1997-11-10 part 2

Ever since I was a wee babe, I worshipped John Romero as a Doom God.

No longer.  After spanking his sorry ass down on doom2 map1,
I know him for the mere mortal scum that he is.  He broke.  That small white 
bug will always be crushed under the giant BFG of Asian Power.

Incidentally he broke about two computers and some other equipment during
intermittent moments in the battle.  Natas said he'd never seen John so mad.
Somehow I feel honored.  "You traitor!  You've been training him!" accused 
Romero.

Natas is a good teacher.  Suck it down.

In other news, I'm about to upgrade Anox to msvc5 and vsourcesafe.  And the 
Pentium-II 300 with Millenium II runs Quake 320x200 at about 70 fps under
Windows NT!!

Starship Troopers, suspending disbelief in the plot(?), was totally awesome,
exciting, and scary as hell.  Best special effects I've seen in a movie, ever.
I think they did a good thing, doing both real models combined with CG.  Seeing
the one-hour special on E! behind the scenes was very cool, as well.

Ha ha.  Daikatana just stole my cool camera scriptor.  Wonder if I get a 
special bonus.  Yeah right.


============ 1997-11-03

Congrats to Daikatana team for an awesome video, shown at The Frag.  Please
do not post any home-brew copies of the movie on the net, because we will
be releasing ours shortly and we would rather not have a lot of low-quality
avi's running around.

Thanks for your cooperation.  


Stayed up last night finishing the camera.  Scripting is done, now Jake has
something to do :-).  Just a few more UI tweaks today and I will finally
be able to sleep.

Happy halloween!

Things have been pretty hectic in Anachronox.  The hardest thing about
programming isn't coding but design.  This week we are finishing the backbone
of Anachronox components that separate it from the pool of Quake-like Quake-
engine games.  My camera and actor scripting are nearing completion, and 
Squirrel's got some really kick-ass dialog scripting and user interfaces
going, as well as some important engine modifications.  Unfortunately we
will have to redo some code after we get Quake 2.  We got a new Boots model
from Ken, and the level designers have put in the truckload of very cool
alien-looking textures that have been flying out of the art department
recently.

I'd say it was a good week, even if I am dead tired.

Few days ago we all trooped into Will's sound booth and started recording some 
lines.  Even I got to talk (I learned how it feels to be a seiyuu I guess).  
After some sound wizardry by Will, our voices were mutated into some really 
bone-chilling speech.  Did I mention every dialog in the game has accompanied
speech?

The only bad news is that I am no longer champion of Tekken 3 in the office :-(
(dodging flames from Sverre and Indigo).

Still running into texture memory limitations though.


============ 1997-10-21

Many people have been complaining about Quake 2 demo.  Coupla things.

** It's a demo for crying out loud.  Not a game, a single-player demo. **

John Carmack mentions in his plan file that "The biggest changes to Quake 2
are internal."  The most impressive visual and gameplay changes are probably 
being saved for the actual game, but those aren't the most important changes.

What matters is that the code is now easy to work with, and means developers
licensing the Quake 2 engine can concentrate on making very cool games.


============ 1997-10-20

I'll mention my thoughts on the programming aspects of Quake 2, and their 
relation to Anox.  Anyways, since it's just a test-demo, there is no point in
talking about gameplay or monsters or weapons.

Quake 2 is compartmentalized -- they have an executable (287 K!), which just 
does setup and the main game loop, rendering dll's (ref_gl.dll and 
ref_soft.dll), and a gameplay dll (gamex86.dll).  This way they can set up a 
nice api where the main executable just calls, say, InitGameAPI or something 
like that to interface to id's "quake api," filling in a structure of 
function pointers.

Sorry if I was repeating info some of you already knew.  Think somebody at id
used to have some of this info in his finger, but I can't seem to find it...

How does this affect us?  It will be a lot of work to reintegrate what we have 
been doing to the engine into the new-and-improved code of Quake 2, but it 
will be much easier to work with as a code base than Quake 1, where you can 
tell some parts were rewritten about 20 times and worked on by different 
people.

Now, what is really cool (and smart business) for id is that they can license 
out just their rendering dll, give developers the link libraries and header 
files to interface to their API, but never have to share their renderer's 
source code with anybody.  Developers can concentrate on making a game and not 
have to dig through mounds of rendering source code, and id can protect
their exclusive rendering technology.

============ Dumb microsoft link error of the day


--------------------Configuration: katanox - Win32 Debug--------------------
Compiling...
katanox.cpp
Linking...
   Creating library Debug/katanox.lib and object Debug/katanox.exp
katanox.obj : fatal error LNK1000: unknown error; consult documentation for technical support options

Joey's workaround:
1) rebuild all
2) failing that, remove all files from project, reinsert, delete Debug directory, rebuild all
3) failing that, create a new project and copy over your source files
4) failing that, cap yourself.


============ 1997-10-16

Sound Blaster tech support was really nice about helping me with a
problem with my sound card -- the output gain was way too high
for my ears using my new Sony MDR-CD570 headphones, so they sent
me a nice little program called sb16wmix.exe.   Seems like this
is the only utility in the world that can set the gain under
Windows NT.  Of course, it's just my luck that it turns out I have
a Vibra 16 soundblaster clone in my system, and that there is
no gain control on it.

Crapola.

Maybe I should upgrade to a 32-bit card.

A couple of people were playing Ultima Online last night.... it 
seems to be pretty fun, except for the fact that often you are
wandering around for hours and hours looking for (a) somebody to
buy stuff from you so you can actually have some gold to do
anything (b) looking for a monster.  The landscape seems to be a
bit barren, and Nelno was going crazy last night trying to find
some low level creatures to fight.  In several hours of searching
he only came across two monsters which were too powerful for his
characters, and one player killer who, well, killed him.

Anachronox?  Oh yes, there was an Ion Storm bowling party last night.
I sucked, because I didn't have a bot to help me.


============ 1997-10-15

Eidos people caught us by surprise today, but we had some cool stuff
to show them.  Our levels are going to rock!!  Totally organic look
and feel, never before seen in any Quake-type game.

Now I sound like a TV ad.

More good progress on the camera scriptor.  Before you know it we will
be able to do stuff any cameraman in real life would want to do....
plus the tool will be usable by anybody, you don't even have to know
how to use a map editor.... and so now TC's can actually have plot,
and all those creative gamers out there won't need a thousand-dollar 
program to make your own really really cool 3d animations and cut 
scenes (that is, those who don't warez 3dstudio max).


============ 1997-10-14

I misworded my plan file the other day.  We do not already have a
code dump from id, I meant we will be getting it sometime next month...
(Thanks to Shawn Green for pointing out my mistake.)


============ 1997-10-13

You might be wondering why some dork would write his date is the
yyyy-mm-dd format.... well lets just say it's my little way of asking
how come Microsoft has forty thousand ways to display the date, except
in the standard ansi format?  If I'm wrong don't flame me, I really don't
care enough.

Anyways I was inspired by my friend Patrick Tewson to update my plan file.
A lot has happened recently, actually.... not only do we have a totally
bad-ass Tekken3 machine in the office (I'd never seen the game before, but
I was a Jun freak in Tekken 2 and smacked Noel around a good deal :-).

We finally split from Daikatana development.  Now we are independent source
code bases, whereas before we were sharing a lot of code.  This way if they
want to modify stuff or if we want to modify stuff, we won't be stepping 
on each other.

Also a couple more new camera types under development, plus movie scripting.
The question is, once I finish complete movie-like scripting tools, do I 
give it to katana, or do I "save the thunder" for Anachronox?

Other good news, we are getting some code updates from id 
within the next two months.
It is both a big relief (we can finally start working on engine stuff again)
and a big fear (oh crap we have the merge of the century to do).
Dunno if katana and anox will be sharing code after that point, though....

Cool materia combo of the day (courtesy of Cleaner):

(Command Counter) + (Mime)

I never thought of that before, but it is amazing if you think about it....


============ 1997-10-04

Camera movement that stops exactly where I want it to stop.  No more
seasickness.


============ 1997-10-03

What is wrong with me? I haven't updated my plan file since July 1.


Well now, I suppose you wanted information on Anachronox.
Everybody in the office is playing Age of Empires, but personally, I like
Dark Reign and Total Annihilation better for the greater complexity of 
the orders you can give to your units (and Total's graphics are kick-ass
enough that I don't mind the 5 fps on my slow-as-hell Matrox Mystique).


A word on video cards.  PowerVR came in the other day, their card totally
ruled.  I can run at 512, 640, 800, and 1024 resolutions, all 4mb on the
card is dedicated to texture memory, the card is $99, and it ran Jedi
Knight at 30 fps in crystal clear 1024x768.  GLQuake ran at 30 fps as well.

I was totally impressed by a card 1/2 the price of a 3dfx, twice the
texture memory, and the same performance.

In fact, Matrox M3D or whatever they call it, has a PowerVR in it.
What?  Matrox finally made a decent 3d card?  Well, this card is better
than decent.  The Mystiques frankly sucked.  They are slow 2D cards and
are slower 3D cards, with no advanced 3D capabilities that a real GL card
would have.  Actually, it was funny running GLquake at .5 frames a second
(mind you this is just displaying the console, not actually playing a level).


Enough on cards.  The game is coming along well.  Go play Final Fantasy VII,
Anachronox will be like that, only cooler.


Have fun,

By the way here is a cool materia combo:

weapon: [Hades] + [Added Effect]
    chance that you will cause confusion, frog, sleep, poison, sleep, etc.
	on any attack with your weapon (like slash-all, deathblow, normal hits)
