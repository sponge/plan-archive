	I'd like to note that, nowadays, it is not possible anymore for a
	totally honnest french person to go have a cigarette outside in peace.

	Tom, I still love you, a little.

	There is a probem i've been working on since more than two years.

	In one word BPM.

	What if i could come up with some kind of BPM detection that REALLY works (not
	like the 'advanced' one in avs which suck, i know i made it). One that would
	work as well on trance, techno, dub, groove, jazz, whatever...

	Would you believe me if i said i did it ?

	I wouldn't believe it until i see it...

	Hi boyz and galz.

	I have to say it feels great to see something you work on since more than a year
	take shape so smoothly. The latest stuff we've been adding to the gui engine really
	offer mindblowing possibilities. It feels very good to work for so many months and
	finaly being able to stand on top of all that work and make some really, really
	cool shit :)

	It probably won't be long before we release the next alpha, we have lot of new
	things to show, but I'm hoping to get a week to watch and validates those latest
	additions. Especially clean up a little bit the script aspect of it so It's not
	gonna change too much hopegfully.

	Anyway, I'm a peon, ask my boss. =)

	On a side note I've been a bit disapointed by the reaction of some of our supporters
	in the forum, whose favorite passtime seem to bitch about Sonique. Anyway, I'd just
	like to separate myself from that. I don't know the Sonique team, but from what I've
	seen their engine looks really good, but then again, so does ours ;)

	The whole thing sound to me just like the old Wordperfect vs MSWord debate (or
	Amiga/Atari, C/Pascal, Coke/Pepsi, MS/Linux, and so on. I think it's sad people get
	themselves so involve into that kind of passionate devotion toward a piece of
	software.

	Anyway, for all the other cool people in the world, I'm happy to have done that
	cool stuff :) Hold on to your pants, you're gonna love this.

	Ok guys, since i forgot to remove the compiler in boxor, here is an update to it,
	it does not have any new function, just bugfixes, i still need to complete the
	control structures before it's really useable, as well as user functions and
	user classes. Anyway, here is the thing, but don't complain if one of the functions
	you're using are not implemented in alpha 5.

	This afternoon i had a 4h walk in the forest, and it was amazing, i
	realized the last time i did that was years ago... Don't get me wrong,
	i've been in a forest quite recently, but it's been like 10 years or
	so since i had a lonely walk under the trees. Everything there seemed
	to engage me in happiness... the little paths, the small rivers, the
	trees, even the unfriendly vegetation i had to go over at one point
	seemed to wink at me :)

	Thanks to my neo25 i had all my ambient music collection at my disposal
	=) I selected Biosphere - Substrata, Brian Eno - Ambient, and a few 
	tracks from Carl Weingarten.

	I have to go to dinner now, they're calling me :) Yumm

	Hellow to you, whoever you are, i already like you because you're
	reading this and it insanely flatters my ego.

	So here i am, in my mother's house in the Basque country in France. I
	think i forgot what silence was, it was really a shock to rediscover
	the meaning of the word... You just have to stand outside by night and
	listen, and you'll hear... nothing... just plain NOTHING. It is really
	amazing when you think about it. 

	I am already feeling much better than just a week ago, i so much needed
	a break that i couldn't realize it. This house is the perfect place to
	rest.

	I was so glad to see all my friends in Paris... Splif (boxor's author),
	Six, Fly, Jimbo, Hollow, Jason, Merou, Exxos, etc... (sorry if i forgot
	you), those people damn rule.

	I'm now feeling quite well! except for a little cloud over my head that
	i'm trying to forget. Ok, i should not have spoken about that, now it's
	all i'm thinking about... (i know you have no clue what i'm talking
	about, lets just say i always make the same mistake, and i did it again).
	I'll try to talk about it sometimes, but not now, it still hurts too
	much.

	Oh, i almost forgot to tell you... I met Bastien, my little nephew,
	he is 4 months old and has a wonderful smile :) He almost never cries,
	he's just a marvel :)

	I'll be back to work on March 1st, but for now i'm trying not to think
	about all the stuff i have to do then. 

	Now off to bed, ttl!

	Wooch! Just landed in Paris... The flight was horrible, the guy
	in front of me took 2 (yes TWO!) seats because he was sooo fat and
	decided to spend his entire flight with his seat inclined to the max
	he could. Now that wouldn't have been a problem if the guy behind me
	wasn't as tall as an NBA player. So the net result of this situation
	was me, trying to survive for 10 hours squezzed between those two,
	with the guy behind apologizing every 10mn for his knees kicking
	my seat and the guy in front of me making it impossible for me to
	change position whatsoever. And worst of all, he had for like 6 HOURS
	his dirty arm 3 inches above my screen :(((

	I think he snored, sometimes, the plane's sound is not that bad.

	Anyway, now i'm in France and it's all good, i'm really looking forward
	to see my familly.

	Ok, i have to go get my mother at the subway station :) Cya

	Winamp 3 Alpha 4 is out, check the forums for an URL
	Here is a small component, done in about 30mn, it allows wa3
	to talk to mIRC for instance, so you'll automatically announce the music
	you're listening to (this can be very obnoxious after a while :). It uses
	DDE so is able to talk to any DDE application. Get it <a href="http://bluemars.org/irctell.wac">here</a>

	Whoo... Brennan and i just went to a Random Pub(tm) and i was drunk for the
	first time since about 2 years. Whooo... weird. Brennan !! Bad influence !!

	Now trying to sober up... hmm...

	Just checked my mail, wondered if i pissed Justin off by saying something ...
	can't remember what it could be.

	Just logged on irc... only idlers there. no good.

	Just started music... good.

	Realized tonight how much i wanna go back to France see my familly.

	Still waiting for my plane tickets.

	Still trying to accept the fact i'm considering changing my policy about being
	single.

	Still drunk... a little bit.

	Trying to get rid of hickup so i can smoke a cigarette in peace.

	Need to pee.

	Running super low on toilet paper.

	Chilling out now.

	Cya

	Ok, i'm off to bed now , this has been an interresting night, two alpha releases in
	2 hours, and so much source server problems it'd look like a lie if i told
	you all about it.

	Anyway, winamp 3 is now a public project, for good and ill. Already a lot of you
	are reporting bugs, that's cool! We know about a good deal of them, so expect
	new alpha versions on a regular basis now since it isn't secret anymore, and we
	will increasingly need you in the future to spot those bugs.

	Same for features, these are exciting times, as winamp 3 comes to a point where
	big things comes together everyday.

	The next big step for me is to bring the compiler up to a point where i can give it
	away (it is just not good enough for now), as well as adding more and more classes
	for you to play with.

	Database code should get some love too, making it more crash-proof.

	I will also keep coordinating with Morgan 'Splif' Thomas, author of the Boxor skin,
	in order to finalize his skins (yes, more skins from Morgan to come!).

	The last, but not least of what i'll do in the next few weeks will be to ... wait
	a minute, i can't tell you everything... i have to keep some bullets for future
	.plan updates!

	Cya, enjoy Winamp 3 <b>alpha</b> 2

	One hour late, wow better than i expected :)

	Thirteen hours and counting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
01/12/2001

	11:55

	Wow, is that a .plan update ? looks like it eheh

	Rob fucking rules, it had to be said.

	I've been working a lot on the skining & scripting stuff, lots of very cool
	stuff for all you skinners :) All i have to say is.... no need to ask the question
	about free form skinning in the forums anymore, it is there, and redefines the
	word 'free' in this instance. 

	I've just spent 20 minutes playing with my friend Splif's latest skin for Winamp3
	hehehe... it's just so cool :) Btw check out his <a href="http://splif.aegis-corp.org">website</a> !

	I am glad the release date approaches. It puts a bit more pressure on us but
	if feels good to be serious about a date at which we will give out what we have.

	I'm a bit scared about the fact we don't have any documentation for all that skinning
	and scripting sutff in the work as of now but anyway, most of you hardcore geks will
	figure it out with a few good examples ;) And we'll try to have the doc ready when
	the official beta is out anyay. 

	Oh well, i think i need to go to work now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/06/2000

	17:31

	This is my final entry in this .plan, i don't feel like updating it anymore.
	Stay tuned to http://bluemars.org, i'll probably start a .plan there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Today was a great day, my stream ranked #1 ambient stream for 10/15
	minutes, hit a new peak of 34 listeners, and i keep receiving positive
	mail about the music i broadcast. It feels very good... Thank you all!

	I spent the day coding a small program that controls my stream winamp
	so it switches playlist on specific hours, so starting from now, the
	stream has a special program between 2am and 4am (PST) called "CryoSleep",
	it is basically 2 hours of zero-beat guaranteed ambient, even more
	quiet than usual, which seemed difficult at first, but i got a few
	good CDs :) I hope you'll like it.

	It's now 4:52, i think i'll watch a StarTrek episode and go to sleep :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10/18/2000

	19:50. 

	My shoutcast stream is now online. If you like ambient music, <a href="http://scastsrv4.shoutcast.com:8010/listen.pls">check it out</a> !
	Requirements: Winamp + a 96kbps capable internet connection.
	Notes: This stream is best listen to while under the light of a candle, no
	immediate business to attend to, and while enjoying whatever it is you enjoy
	doing while listening to slow and relaxing music.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09/16/2000

	11:58. I'm exhausted.

	I just spent the night coding, it feel so good... I got zillions of things done.

	My eyes are closing against my will so i guess it's time to go sleep a bit. 

	I think i'll watch a Star Trek episode first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
09/06/2000

	22:31. Wow, it has been a long time since i haven't updated this thing... 

	Ok, so what's new ? Wasabi is coming really nicely, i know you're tired of
	reading that, but eh, it's true. We are working really hard night and day to
	make it really really, really good. 

	These past days i've been working on reducing the memory footprint, making it
	faster to load, etc. I've been also working on a small component that does so
	much with 8k of code... heehee :) Developers are really going to love this version.

	On a side note...

	Q. Will Winamp 3 support video playback ?
	A. Video ? Let see... Oh, i remember doing that a long time ago for fun :)

	Oh and, by the way... ASF, WMV, ASX, WVX, MPEG, MPG and AVI are all automagically
	supported by *any* application that uses the Media Player activeX control... so
	we won't brag about that :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
08/15/2000

	20:04. I just arrived at the office and i'm ready to code for most of the
	night. I love those nights of code when nobody disturbs you, you end up
	working ten times faster. I missed that, i'm glad to do it again.

	My appartment is still a good deal empty, i'll have to go to ikea, sometime.

	Ok, yes, i know, you don't care about me nor my apartment, all you want to
	read about is Wasabi. Ok, ok... so here we are. I'm working again on the
	database these days, adding and changing stuff. Making it idiot-proof,
	faster, etc. 

	It *is* coming :) 

	Patience is a virtue, be virtuous.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/21/2000

	22:41. Just came back at the office to bring back more stuff to my new
	home. It's so empty there right now, only a bed... :)

	I just found out with Brennan what a cool view of San Francisco i have
	from the roof! Here are a few pics :) <a href="http://www.quadrants.net/daview/">http://www.quadrants.net/daview/</a>

	Now i need a tv, dsl and some stuff from ikea and i'll be set!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/20/2000

	20:15. I found my place. It's a nice apartment in the Potrero area of
	San Francisco, one block away from a friend's place, seven blocks from
	work, sunny and quiet, in one word: PERFECT :) No i have to fill this
	empty space with bed, table, chairs, couch, tv, etc. etc. ...

	Whoohoo!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/15/2000

	00:12. Went to the "Bardo a gogo" club... Bastille night... that was
	most interresting...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
07/14/2000

	19:54. I never imagined it would be such a pain in the ass to find a
	place to live here in SF :( I keep finding either VERY (read much too)
	expensive places (wtf ? $2000 for 1 bedroom?!) or already rented ones.

	I think i'll go to the Bastille cafe tonight, just to change my mind...
	lots of french people are supposed to be there to celebrate the french
	nationnal day... may turn out to be interresting... i don't expect much
	tho. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/26/2000

	15:14. I feel GREAT ! :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/25/2000

	16:18. Came to the office, started to code a bit, actually wrote about
	20 lines of code and decided i was bored. Watched Denny playing Tonny
	Hawk and achieving scores i can't even dream of. Came back to my desk
	opened a telnet session to write a finger update.

	Now i'm staring at vi, wondering what the next word i'll type will be.

	I definitly have nothing to say.

	Ok, i'm bored. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/22/2000

	23:12. I lost all my illusions. All i can do now is wonder about
	myself. Was i naive ?

	Peace for men of good will... i used to say that... I'm afraid there
	are very few on this planet.

	Life goes on as they say... but i'm not sure i want to hear again the
	words "how you doin'?", or i might actually answer.

	Sometimes i wish i believed in some supreme being, so i could at least
	ask him "what did i do wrong?" instead of asking myself...

	Of course none of this makes any sense to you, i guess that's fine, i
	don't want to bother anybody with all that crap... i've never wanted
	to bother anybody... ever... maybe that's the problem...

	I should probably concentrate on my work, it's the best thing that
	ever happened to me... 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/17/2000

	4:27am. I feel tired, i've been coding since we got back from getting
	drunk with Brennan, Christophe, Justin and friends, but now my eyes are
	closing against my will. I know they'll eventually win.

	Anyway today was the day we showed our work on Wasabi to people at the 
	office for the first time. I think it's was a pretty good demo, nothing
	crashed anyway :)

	Well, i'll be very busy the next few days since i just put some more
	work on myself, but heh, i can't help it :) Anyway, i think it's better
	to work more and to do things the right way...

	We're still at the hotel (ron & me) for a few more days and then we
	should be able to get a place, i'm so sick of those damn hotels who
	charge like the Ritz Carlton or The Hilton and has no room service, no
	minibar, no restaurant, and worst of all, no UPN44 (which is the only
	interresting tv channel for me hehe)... Anyway, i still catch Startrek
	from the office...
 
	I think it'll not be long till we get back to sleep, feelinnng sleeepppppyyyyy....

06/09/2000

	13:34. Rob's gone... i still can't believe it... :( 

	I'm now staring at my protoculture ball(tm), my stomach fighting
	against the togo sandwitch i just ate. life is odd.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/28/2000

	16:18. I just came back from a weekend at my mother's place in the
	south of France... very refreshing... calm... Too bad the water in the
	swimming pool was a bit too cold, but the weather was very nice and
	overall it was a great weekend. Then i took the plane to go back to
	Paris, took a few pics thru the window, then got a cab to my brother's
	place, and dropped my cell phone in the street. When i noticed it was
	too late :( Now it's not a very big problem since i'm going in the US
	in a few days now, but still, i had all my contacts in this phonebook
	:(

	It's now a bit more than an hour ago and my phone line is still active
	despite the declaration of stealing. Whoever has my phone won't answer
	(of course), and they even hangup after every first ring.

	I think i'll try to enjoy the remaining of my sunday despite of that...
	I'll just pretend nothing happened...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
05/25/2000

	10:49, I just woke up and finished my coffee cup, then i went to take
	my mail, and here was it : MY VISA !!

	From today, i am now officially abilited to work in the US for a period
	of 18 months!

	You probably don't care about it but i thought i could spend a few
	minutes writing a bit about how i feel presently (kinda Steve-styled
	.plan today) 
	
	It is a bit difficult to explain how i feel, this whole VISA process
	was taking down on my nerves, generating a big load of everyday stress,
	and now, it's over. It's like if my stomach was tied for months and just
	untied this morning.

	Since a few months now, my life has been dramatically changing, flying
	back and forth between Paris and San Francisco, yet, this longing VISA
	process was holding the transition.

	There now seems to be nothing holding me back, i'm now really entering
	a new chapter of my life, without having to stay at the step of the
	door. I think i only felt this two times before in my life, in fact,
	each time was a turning point, and each time it turned out to be for 
	the best. I can't wait to see what this new path will go through, i
	hope the future will give me the opportunity to spend those 18 months
	up to my expectations.

	to move, to push farther out;
	to cause to set out towards.

04/30/2000

	21:10, Time to wake up... i've been working all the night on GUI code
	and i eventually did what i wanted... thank you very much microsoft for
	having implemented custom draw on lists but not on trees... But the
	cool thing is i now know how windowblinds and co insert a background
	behind almost everything... the idea behind it very simple, yet although
	i did a lot of this kind of things in esense, i always wondered about
	this specific feature. I guess next time i should spend more time reading
	documentation... :)

	Anyway, now it's sunday night, and what does that mean ? StarTrek !
	The best way to start a productive night of code !

	Oh, i forgot... If you never heard Biosphere, go buy a CD, they are
	a bit difficult to find now but you won't regreat it... Get "Patashnik"
	it's a good start. The best description i have is "Space Ambient"...
	Just press play, turn off the lights, and relax. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04/24/2000

	Wahh i just bought the Sony 1600x1200 digital camera, and it's just
	AWESOME! Now i just need to buy my LX200 telescope, and the adapter
	to plug the camera, wow i can't wait...

	I'll try to set up a picture section on quadrants.net sometime.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04/22/2000

	Wooch... worked very late yesterday night to finish the first version
	of avs script, and now i have (as we say in france) my head in my butt...
	There are still some things that need to be improved but i did my first
	ass file (!) and i think it does a decent job at giving the idea...

	Anyway, i woke up today at 6pm, and right now, all that defines me is
	headache, exhaustion, and also sense of dizzyness... nothing unusual.
