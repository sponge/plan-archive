What's new :

	- Not much, I'm writing this...

What I'm working on right now :

	- Winamp 3's GUI, DB, Script & Skin system
	- Some CBP research (see url above)

In the back of my mind there is :

	- My family, always
	- My friends, also
	- My job, more than I'd sometime like it to
	- A BPM detection algorithm that uses pulsar detection code
	- A skinned/scripted shell using the wasabi gui engine
	- A lot of small ideas for winamp3 scripts
	- More...

What I ate yesterday :

	- Mr Pizzaman's toasted raviolis cheese + toasted mushrooms
	- Chips
	- Cheesecake

Yesterday, I did not poop.

Francis.
