So, just got back from California and visiting with some of my friends at the old stomping 
ground -- 3Dfx.  It hasn't been too long since we (Gary and I) left to work on the UberEngine and
a game based on the technology, but it really has grown a lot.  I literally did not recognize 1/2 
of the people in the office.  Everyone seems to be doing well and in good spirits.  
I saw some really cool stuff while there.  Quake 2 at 1024x768 on a Voodoo2 SLI rig was 
running VERY playable frame rates.  I once thought that 640x480 with good visual quality was 
good enough for games, but seeing Quake2 at 1024x768 changed my mind.  Since 3Dfx calculates 
MIP mapping per pixel and the resolution of the games is as high as it is -- the top most MIP 
map level is typcially used everywhere, thus the images look really sharp.  Also of note was the
aliasing, or more importantly the LACK of noticable geometric aliasing and MIP map banding at this 
resolution.  It was stunning to say the least.  For all of you out there who play Quake or 
Quake2 -- a Voodoo2 SLI rig is what you have been dreaming of.  If you are a speed freak -- Quake2 
with this configuraion at 800x600 was running at a constant 60 fps -- very sweet.  Can't wait to 
get mine.  Creative boards should be out in stores at I write this.

Until next time.....
