A lot has been happening the last couple of days.  Research has turned 
into true implemetations and all is going well.  Working hard toward our first
milestone -- February 1st.  At that point we should have the basics of the
level editor up and running.  Who knows, we might start showing some tech.
screen shots in March.  Everything is going well, can't wait until we can 
talk a little more about the technology and get some feedback.

The nice thing about the technology we are creating is its scalability.  The
game should take advantage of the higher end cards out currently, as well as
taking advantage of the planned future technology from the leading graphics
hardware companies.

Until next time...
