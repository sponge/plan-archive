Whatever happened to a good old-fashioned text adventure.  Some of
my all time favorite games are the old Infocom games.  I have played
and finished almost every one of them.  Somebody should really think
about doing a new text adventure game.  I know the recent
trend is graphic adventures, but there is still a place for text
adventures.  I parallel this to watching television and reading a book.
I enjoy television and the visual stories it provides, but I still very 
much enjoy reading books and envisioning worlds and characters in 
my mind.  I do enjoy games like Myst, Riven, and the latest Zork installment,  
however I yearn for a good text adventure.  I recently purchased Starship
Titanic because it boasted a text interface to a graphic adventure.  The text 
interface is used for "talking" only.  This was a bit of a let down, but
better than the multiple choice "talking" interfaces (like those found in Monkey
Island -- which was a good game despite this fact).  Starship Titanic looks like 
it will be a lot of fun (haven't had too much time to play games lately), 
but again I was hoping for that old style interface.

Maybe I am just getting old......nah, that's not it.

Until next time...
