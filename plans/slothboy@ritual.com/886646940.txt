Well, the first milestone has been finished...Yeah!  A couple of days late 
-- but that is on time as far as software deadlines go, maybe even early.  
The basics of the level editor are up.  It is still very crude, but it will 
serve as a sufficient whipping post for the level editors I am sure.  I am
expecting many modification suggestions. The current list is 32 strong and 
growing daily.

From this point, I will handle the level editor updates, modifications, and 
fixes, and Gary is going off to implement lighting -- I think he will
have the most fun this milestone, but I got to do the "researchy-thing" 
while he got stuck implementing the basics of the level editor on the 
first pass.  Fair turn-about.

Looking forward to bringing you some cool screenshots in the future...


On a personal note, I am a movie junkie and as of late have been purchasing
many DVD's.  I hear (rumor has it) that FOX and Paramount are supposed
to be announcing support this month.  I also heard that Lucas himself was
putting the pressure on FOX.  This would be great, but unfortunately I have
only heard this as a rumor.  Anybody know any more out there????

Until next time....
