===========

Been awhile since the last update.  

UberEngine:
The geometry is almost complete.  I had 3 major worries about the curved 
surfaces and LOD that finally came to a head this week.  Two of them are 
completely fixed and the other remains at 80% complete.  That is what I 
will be focusing on in the next couple of weeks.  The "adjustment" that 
Gary and I came up with a few weeks ago is working out very nicely.

The Level Designers seemed to be pretty happy with the way the tools
will function, and there is little to no preprocessing necessary for
generating the levels.  More details on this in the future.  

Gary has been busy pluggin away at the lighting code and has the 
basics up now.  We have another big intergration coming toward the
end of this month.  At that point, we should actually have some nice
looking geometry (textured and lit).

The Game:
The game design is coming along as well.  This has been a big time
sink in the past month.  There are some really cool ideas floating
around the group.  Can't wait until we are able to start talking about
specifics.  The major "plot" of the storyline is almost complete, the
Level Designers are thinking about what they would like to do with
the given environments, and characters are being flushed out.  All in
all things are going pretty well.  I am really excited about this 
project.

I know that the updates thus far have been somewhat cryptic, but as the
technology is getting more solidified we will definitely open up.  As a
matter of fact Gary and myself are talking at CGDC about Hardware and
Engine Scalability.  Some of UberEngine will probably make an appearance
in that talk.

Until next time....
