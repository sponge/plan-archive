The SMP support is solid enough to play with now.  The only feature that is
still broken is light flares.

As a happy consequence, some of the cleanup work I did for SMP gave a couple
percent speedup even when running without the separate thread.

On my development system, a dual 300 mhz intergraph realizm II, the low res
timedemo scores went from 27.8 to 37.8 with "r_smp 1".  This is only a 35%
average speedup, but at some times (lots of dynamic lights in complex scenes)
the speedup is 90%+.  Gameplay is noticably smoother.

The rendering thread is almost always the blocking factor, so the faster the
card and OpenGL driver, the larger the speedup will be.

This is explicitly a two thread producer / consumer, so there is no benefit
to more than two processors.  The app is well behaved, using sleeping
syncronization so that you usually still have half a processor free for other
operating system functions.

Hopefully we will be able to test with some fast consumer cards sometime
soon.

------

A lot of people asked what was done differently this time vs the last time
I tried (without benefit) to use SMP.

My original attempt was to make a DLL that intercepted all OpenGL calls and
let a separate processor execute them.  The benefit would have been that all
OpenGL applications could have gone faster.  The problem was that the
bandwidth required to encode all the commands was enough that the processor
overhead was as much as it would have taken to just do the geometry on the
main processor.

It would have still been a win if the geometry side was doing
lots of work, like multiple lights, user clip planes, and texgens, but for
the vast majority of geometry, it didn't balance out.  If someone wanted to
try that using the PIII or AltiVec streaming memory operations, it could
probably still work.

The current SMP code is implemented directly into the renderer, and a lot of
things were moved around and double buffered to allow it to use data in
place, instead of having to copy it off.

------

Some people expressed surprise that Quake3 wasn't threaded already.

Threading has been presented so often as the "high tech" "cool" way to
program, that many people aren't aware of the downsides.

A multi-threaded program will always have somewhat lower throughput when 
running on a single CPU than a single threaded program that polls in
explicit places.  The cost of a context switch at the cpu level is negligible,
but the damage that it can do to the cache hierarchy can add up to a
noticeable amount in bad cases.

The much larger problem is that you lose tight control over when things
occur.  If the framerates are low enough, it isn't a huge issue, but for
applications running at 30+ fps, you really don't want to trust the OS
scheduler to coordinate multiple threads and have them all get in every
frame.  Yes, with explicit sleep() calls you can sort of get it working,
but at that point, you might as well not be using threads.

A good example of not-quite-in-sync issues in the windows mouse performance.
A PS/2 mouse only samples 40 times a second, so when you get an app updating
at around that speed, you will get 0/1/2 scheduling variances.

They are also not terribly portable, and a pain in the ass to debug.

Now that all the E3 stuff is done with, I can get back to work...

I was stuck in a room the entire time doing press interviews, but it seemed
to have gone well.  It was mentioned to me that there were a few people on
the show floor with forged badges that read "John Carmack -- Id Software".
As if forged email / irc / icq isn't enough of a problem.  Sigh.

The "download" crashtest was first reported by Rick Hammerstone.  That was
a pure dumbass mistake on my part.

I should be sending the accumulated crashtest bounties off tomorrow.

The plan right now is to have an update release next week that will have
lots of bug fixes and cheat protections, but not too many new user visible
features.

I finally got around to implementing dual processor acceleration today.  I
still have a couple issues to resolve and some more rearranging to do, but
it is giving 20%+ speedup right now in a worst-case situation for it.

When completed, I expect the average speedup to be in the 40% to 80% range,
depending on what is going on and the video configuration.  Scenes with lots
of dynamic lighting and lots of sounds and other client processing going will
show the largest speedups.  It helps the slow scenes more than the fast
scenes, which is basically what you want.

I am going to shake this out with the Windows (NT) code first, but it should
definately make its way to the linux port eventually.

I know SMP is a que for all the BeOS folks to ask about ports, so I'm going
to head that off:  Be has all the code for Q3 (and Q2, for that matter), and
a version of Q3test should be available by the time they ship a release OS
with OpenGL hardware acceleration.

There will probably also be an SGI-irix port.

Regarding both of those ports: they are not supported ports, and will be
maintained by volenteers (like the current MacOS X port).  Update releases
will lag the official ones, and we won't committ to ANY dates.

I am doing all of my development on intergraph and sgi-NT hardware, but when
I have everything rock solid, I will give Nvidia and ATI's NT drivers a try.
I would be somewhat shocked if they didn't explode -- I doubt multiple
threads playing occasional tag team on a context has been well tested.

True, only a tiny fraction of our players (probably less than 1%) will be
able to take advantage of this, but I consider SMP usage to be an important
technology to nurture over the coming years.

The top of the benchmark chart should be an SMP system (assuming the NT
drivers have all the optimizations of the '98 drivers), and it will also
be possible to build a reletively cheap SMP system (say, dual 400's) that
outperforms the best single processor system.

We had to upgrade the crashtest machine to NT sp 5, because
some people were attacking it with windows crashers.  Those
don't count.

Crashtest #3 from [iBO]QWhAX0R was a combination of two
problems:

The symptom was disconnecting all clients with an illegible
server message.  This turned out to be caused by the fact
that I was parsing strings out of my net buffers with a
MSG_ReadChar() function, and I was checking for EOF as a
negative one return value.  I had to change this to a
MSG_ReadByte() call, because -1 was showing up in the
messages, which then caused a parse error because it wasn't
really the end of the message.

The actual root of that issue was code like this:
{
	char	buffer[MAX_STRING_CHARS];

	...
	strncpy( buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1 );
	...
}

No buffer overruns are possible, but buffer is not forced
to be zero terminated if on the stack.  I'm pretty sure this
was a result of copy-and-paste code where buffer used to be
a static with a guaranteed zero, but it made me find several
other places where similar things were happening.

I had started using a Q_strncpyz() function a while ago that
guarantees a trailing zero and doesn't require the -1, but it
turned out that between code I had written a long time ago,
and code that either Cash or Brian had added, there were still
a lot of normal strncpy calls around.  A lot of them were wrong,
too.  Either missing the -1, or missing the dedicated 0 fill in.

Crashtest #4 from Jim Paris was a variation on the first part
of #3.

Only one of these attacks so far has been a server crasher, but
I have been giving the bounty for anything that immediately kicks
all the players.  I probably won't give it for attacks that only
overflow some lagged clients, but I'll evaluate as they happen.

I am off to E3 now for a bunch of PR silliness, so if
crashtest goes down, it won't be back up for a while...


* fixed crashtest 4
* fixed crashtest 3
* fixed jumping-over-item pickup prediction error
* made "Couldn't load sound" a developer only warning
* fixed demo recording not including portal surface entities
* precache grenade bounce sounds

You can bias the level of detail lower than allowed in the
menu with "r_lodbias 2", which will force all models to the lowest
lod.  The view weapon will look very ugly.

Another little speedup option that isn't offered in the menus is:
"cg_simpleitems 1" this removes the extra rings and spheres around
some items.

You can also turn off all the gibs with "cg_gibs 0".


* clear game memory at init, which fixes the stuck-at-intermission
	problem on mac servers
* fixed mismatched free / Z_Free in demo menu
* removed unused reference to sprites/plama.md3
* automatically get sounds from model name
* scale sensitivity by zoom
* immediately archive changes to latched cvars
* cheat protect r_portalonly
* don't print "XXX connected" on level restarts
* fixed "give item" on levels where 0,0,0 is in solid
* fixed timedemo
* don't play pain falling sound if dead
* fixed falling damage sound not snd specific
* fixed crashtest 2
* fixed crashtest 1
* q3map_backshader
* q3map_globaltexture

Do NOT send bug reports and game comments directly to me!
If I have to filter through hundreds of emails a day, I won't get any
more work done...  Only crashtest related problems should come to me,
everything else should go to q3feedback@idsoftware.com.

Sami Tammilehto wins the second prize.  Some large connectionless packets
can cause crashes.

This one was a result of me having the maximum token size defined lower
than the maximum string size.

BigImp wins the first prize.  It doesn't crash the server, but fmtspec
names will crash all clients that try to log on.  Technically that would
be an upkeep required DOS attack, but I'll let this one go.

I even had a "FIXME: make vsprintf safe" comment by the offending line...

I am going to update the server to filter out all % chars that come in
over the net to prevent any other similar things.

Everyone should realize that many popular net links are going to be clogged
up with q3test downloads for a while, so net play may be a bit patchy to
a lot of servers.

-------------

Now that the first win32 test is out, here is The Plan for going forward:

All future releases should be same-day for all architectures.

There may be an exe-only update to the current distributions if there are
significant problems, but it isn't scheduled.

The next major test release will include a new one on one map designed for
tournement play, and new executables with server and game modifications, but
will not require downloading a new pak0.pk3.

The release after that will introduce various teamplay rules on the original
two maps.  This version will likely be another full download, because I
know that I still have a couple things to c
