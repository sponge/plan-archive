* rework versioning for architecture tracking
* use a seperate endpoint for address resolves on mac
* hide OTLook warnings if "developer" isn't set
* defered mac renderer scanning until after mode set so
	8 bit desktops don't confuse it
* global motd/update server
* fixed view model animations on models with custom anims

technical note:

Q3 can run networked player movement in either an asynchronous or
synchronous manner.  The default mode is to allow all client movement to be
done asynchronously with the servers advancement of time.

The primary reason is to allow player movement to be predicted on the client
side.  The primary drawback is that while your movement is smooth, the other
players that you see running around in the world move with a jerkiness that
is relative to their framerate and network connection quality.  It is NOT
necessarily relative to their ping - a player on a fast system with a clean
modem connection can move smoothly.  If you see a player stuttering around,
either they have a bad franerate, or the network connection between them and
the server or you and the server is poor.  The amount of stuttering is sort
of the sum of the dropped or variable packets on BOTH connections.

You can force Q3 to run all clients synchronously by setting
"g_synchronousClients 1" on the server.  This will make Q3 behave similar to
Q1 for networking.  All movement will be lagged except view angles, which are
still short-circuited immediately.

Some people claim to prefer synchronous movement when everyone had a very
good ping, but I don't personally think it is ever a play benefit.  It
makes leading players a bit easier, but I think the crisp movement control
of client side prediction is a much better tradeoff.

However, there is still a reason for using it:  recorded demos come out a
LOT smoother looking when running with sync.  Note that q3test does not
allow demo recording and playback, so this is just for future reference...

One more addition to net cvars:

"cl_maxpackets" will restrict the maximum number of outgoing
packets to prevent client to server rate problems.  This does
not limit the client framerate.  This defaults to 20, which
might actually be a bit low.  You might try experimenting
with raising this to 40.

"cl_maxfps" still exists, but it will never need to be used
for networking reasons.

Interpreting the lagometer (the graph in the lower right corner):

The upper graph (blue/yellow) slides one pixel for every rendered
frame.  Blue lines below the baseline mean that the frame is
interpolating between two valid snapshots.  Yellow lines above
the baseline mean the frame is extrapolating beyond the latest
valid time.  The length of the line is proportional to the time.

The lower graph (green/yellow/red) slides one pixel for every
received snapshot.  By default, snapshots come 20 times a second,
so if you are running >20 fps, the top graph will move faster, and
vice versa.  A red bar means the snapshot was dropped by the
network.  Green and yellow bars are properly received snapshots,
with the height of the bar proportional to the ping.  A yellow
bar indicates that the previous snapshot was intentionally
supressed to stay under the rate limit.

The upper graph indicates the consistancy of your connection.
Ideally, you should always have blue bars of only a pixel or two
in height.  If you are commonly getting big triangles of yellow
on the graph, your connection is inconsistant.

In a heavy firefight, it is normal for modem players to see yellow
bars in the bottom graph, which should return to green when the
action quiets down.  If you are getting several red bars visible,
you may want to look for a server that drops less packets.

There are a few tuning variables for people trying to optimize
their connection:

The most important one is "rate", which is what the connection
speed option in the menu sets.

We are fairly conservative with the values we set for the given
modem speeds: 2500 for 28.8, 3000 for 33, and 3500 for 56k.

You may actually be connecting faster than that, and modem
compression may be buying you something, so you might get a
better play experience by increasing the values slightly.

If you connect at 50000 bps, try a rate of 5000, etc.

I err on the conservative side, because too low of a rate will
only make the movement of other things in the world choppy, while
too high of a rate can cause huge amounts of lag.

Note that the optimal rate will be somewhat lower than a rate
for QW or Q2, because I now include the UDP packet header
length in the bandwidth estimate.

You can ask for a different number of snapshots by changing the
"snaps" variable, but there isn't a lot of benefit to that.
Dedicated servers run at 40hz, so stick to divisors of that:
40, 20 (default), 10.  A snaps of 40 will usually just cause
you to hit your rate limit a lot faster.  It may be usefull
for tuning rate, if nothing else.

You can adjust the local timing point with "cg_timenudge ",
which effectively adds local lag to try to make sure you interpolate
instead of extrapolate.  If you really want to play on a server that
is dropping a ton of packets, a timenudge of 100 or so might make
the game smoother.

Some people seem to think that I just make up these performance comparison
numbers.  I don't.  I measure things, and I understand control conditions.

In this discussion, assume "wintel" is a 500 mhz PIII with either a agp
rage128, or an agp TNT card, and "macos" is a 400 mhz G3 with the pci rage128.

At the highest level, you can make application class comparisons between
platforms.  For instance, CodeWarrior on the mac compiles faster than VC++
on wintel, but stuffit is way slower than winzip.  This is useful data,
but says more about the application design than the relative merits of the
platforms.  CW uses a single object file repository, for instance.

A better comparison is an identical app on both platforms.

Photoshop is often faster on macos than wintel.  There is certainly a lot
of common code, but individual filters are optimized for each platform.
Some of these hand optimized operations are significantly faster on the
mac.

Quake1 was the counterpoint to that.  Quake1 had significant amounts of
hand tuned asm code for intel, and the PPC version never got as much
attention.  The PPC version was noticeably slower (you would have to time
at 640*480 to avoid unfairly penalizing the mac for lack of low res
modes).

So, clearly, hand tuned asm code can make either platform pull ahead.  It
also shows that the two platforms are at least fairly close in performance.
I never said macs were SLOW, just not quite as fast as the best intel systems.

Quake3 doesn't software rasterize, so there isn't any great place for lots
of asm code (the great place is in the OpenGL driver).  The code is
essentially identical on all platforms.

Q3 is definitely faster on a wintel system than a macos system.  When the
wintel version is released, everyone will be independantly repeating that
measurement.

Even this measurement isn't exactly an apples to apples comparison, because
the OpenGL driver and 3D card are still a significant variance.  The two
can be broken out farther:  Q3 can be run without 3D output to test just
the identical compiled code.  Wintel is still faster, although somewhat
less so.  The OpenGL + 3D card setup can be benchmarked separately on the
axis of throughput and fill rate, which show the intel system being
significantly faster.  I can't break that apart into the two separate
components, but I will guess that the OpenGL driver is probably as efficient
as the wintel drivers and the performance delta is due to the system
interface and the video card.  The current mac rage128 cards run at 75 mhz,
which is a third slower than the PC cards.  AGP is also more than just a
faster PCI, it can influence the structure of communication with the card.

It has been my observation in the past that most of my code tracks just about
midway between specint and specfp for performance comparisons.  There is a
lot of floating point, but it is all short vectors, rather than the massive
vectors of scientific computing.  If we discount the graphics subsystem, Q3
follows this reasonably well.  The intel system does slightly better than
projected.

"Sucks" is a subjective description that can be dismissed as opinion.  Note
that I have NEVER said that the hardware sucks, or the user interface sucks,
just that the mac OPERATING SYSTEM sucks.

"Faster", when qualified with testing conditions, is objective, and all the
wishing in the world doesn't change it.

Objectivity and quantification are the paths to improvement.  

I will be very happy if Apple can produce a desktop system that is faster
than anything else you can get.  I respect good engineering from any source.
Altivec should be better than the PIII extensions (trinary ops -- yeah!).
The upcoming system architectures look good.  They have a shot at it, but
they won't make it if they complacently think "oh, we are already faster
than any pc system".

My twin turbo F50 can still be outrun at the dragstrip by much cheaper
race cars.  Many ferrari owners would not dare set foot at a drag strip,
because they fear objective measurements that may not show their important
possession in the best light.  I would rather have the facts, so I can base
future decisions on logical grounds.

We are finally closing in on the first release of Q3test.

As you have probably heard by now, the first release in going to be the mac
version, probably followed by the linux version, and only then the
windows version.

Some of you are busy getting all bent out of shape about this.

We want to get a lot of people playing with the test to find bugs and
offer well thought out suggestions, but there are classes of bugs and
suggestions that emerge in each order of magnitude of exposed testers.

If a given bug is going to show up when a thousand people have looked
at it, but we had released it to a hundred thousand people, then we are
going to have a lot of duplication to wade through.

The mac testers will find some obvious problems.
We will fix them.
The later releases will be better.

Even if we had the windows distribution ready to go right now, I would
still seriously consider releasing one of the mac or linux versions first
because it will make our tracking a lot easier.

The holdup on the windows side are the issues with updated driver
distribution.  The game itself doesn't have any holdups.

We could do a windows release for just, say, voodoo2 owners and get some
of the benefit of a controlled release, but it wouldn't really work out,
because everyone would figure out that it can be made to (almost) work
on lots of other cards by tweaking some values.  That type of feedback
would not be useful, because we KNOW that there are problems with most
of the current drivers.  We have been working with all of the vendors
for the past year to get them all straightened out.

Glsetup is going to be slick -- just run it and it will Do The Right Thing
