It's been quite awhile since my last update. So, to make everyone happy :)
Wow, according to webdog it's been over a year since my last post.

Since then, things change, yes they do.  I moved, no longer in Belmont, now
I'm in noisy San Bruno. I'm about 1/4 mile away from the end of the runway at SFO.
We have thick walls, which means that the neighbors have thick walls, so when the planes
take off, we barely hear them.  Which also means I can crank the amp and the neighbors 
dont complain ;)

Hey, a long time ago, I met this grrl, you may remember. Her name was tradee(tracy), she
lived in Sacramento... I'm trying to find her, if you know her, have her send me an email.
(Nothing personal, just wanted to thank her for something).

Shoutcast development has split open, working on multiple projects now, it's entertaining to
say the least.  We're releasing version 1.8.7 either tonight or tomorrow.

Ooo, ooo, I've been spinning for well over  a year now, getting into a definite style (Progressive).
Swing by my site to check out some of the mixes from my friends and I. (<a href=http://www.tagstrance.com/>www.tagstrance.com</a>)

I think thats enough for now :)  More news later, and I promise it wont be a year.
