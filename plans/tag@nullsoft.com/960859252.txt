	It's been a while since my last update, as you can tell.  Lots of things
going on the world of SHOUTcast.  I released 1.3.0 and above, currently as of 
today, 1.666.1 (the symmetrical satanic release). Not much going in my world as 
far as a personal life, work sort of merged with it since I've been
here.  If you know where my personality went, please let me know, I miss it.

	&lt rant &gt Gateway computers suck, I picked up a "supposed" p2-400 last year
from them.  Yet it keeps reporting that it's a Celeron. Don't ever buy Gateway.
&lt /rant &gt Micron hopes to shine better, we'll see how it goes... Still waiting 
for the machine.

	New things in the pipe, finger Tom for more info.  We really kicked out
some cool new features in the SHOUTcast DSP plug-in.  Great work Justin!!!

	By the way, I got those pictures scanned from Vibe. Go

	I did it! I bought my first new vehicle; Toyota Tacoma 4WD SR5 V6 Truck, 
and it's PURPLE! The new place in Boulder Creek is ready, and we've started 
moving stuff into it.  All I can say at this point is, I have a great life, 
and I'm so so so glad I made the decision to come out here.  I've met some
great people; all the people at nullsoft/spinner, gina, tradee, lolo, kimmie,
amy, don, richie, golbie, gene, it's been a pleasure working/partying with 
them all!  I'm so happy right now :)

	Wow. Ok, so last episode in Tag's SF adventure there was talk of a 
pre-thanksgiving party at the EndUp called VIBE.  I made it there about 1am.
Tom, *the* bastard, detained me from attending earlier, as we needed to
"**** the Airline".  Happy to say I'm the proud owner of a free roundtrip ticket 
to Maui or Cancun; can't decide.  

	Vibe was ok, in my opinion, conga's need to be banned at clubs. I 
understand they where going for the tribal theme, but christ did you have 
to play them the WHOLE time?  When Charlotte the Baroness finally got on the
decks it was 5:30am,  and she got bumped early too.  I think she was the
best one they had there. Hard to hear her though with the 3 separate conga sets.

	I found Amy about 1:30am, and I had a really wicked picture taken of her
while she was dancing. I'll get it scanned in soon. Tradee(tracy) drove in from
Sacramento at 3:30am with 3 friends.  It was very cool dancing, drinking, etc..
with the whole group.  Nice thing about a club that stays open until 9am, they
start serving drinks again at 6:00am, HA.  Ok, so I really didn't NEED another
Cape Cod, but could you blame me?  Anyway, we left the club at 9:00am on the 
nose, and decided that food was in order, so we made for a cafe up near Castro.

	On the way, my head was starting to pound... well making a very long story
short... don't take tylenol-3 for a headache when you're deathly allergic to
codeine. Thank you Tom for bringing me OJ and Goldfish crackers after the 
numerous techno-color yawns trying to flush the codeine from my body :)

	Happy Trancegiving everyone!!! And may your stomach be settled more than
mine.

	From the spinner/nullsoft decompression, to the maze at 550, in the space
Of 9 hours, and I think I stopped drinking at 2am.  I kept the night at that
'just got a buzz goin' level. It was very smooth indeed.  I have to thank
Brennan, and his friend Amy for hooking me up with the maze at 550 Barneveld.

	Every 3rd Friday at 550 is Maze, produced by Maze and XLR8R. 
Amy hooked me up with another event coming on the 24th over at the EndUp.
"Vibe" pre-thanksgiving party. Doors open at 10pm and is free entry until
10:30pm. They plan to run til 9am the Head Liners are John Howard and Charlotte
the Baroness. Ok, shameless plug, but hey, Amy rocks.

	In the meantime I suggest you tune into my SHOUTcast stream, it's 
9644stereo, so you'll need a decent connection to listen in. This is a 
hard/progressive trance weekend.
