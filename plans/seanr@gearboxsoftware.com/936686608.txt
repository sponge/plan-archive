Shhh


Plan:
  John reasserted his reign over all that kicks ass
today by getting the companies Internet connection 
up.  Its been down since the move to our new location,
which took place on the ninth of this month.

  Being at a computer without bluesnews at my fingertips
is a painful experience that I would not like to repeat.

  Book report:  Neal Stephensons Cryptonomicron was
pretty good.  As a crypto hobbyist, I really dug on 
the subject matter.  And I enjoyed how he tied historic 
people/events into the story.  But I still think Snow Crash
is his best work.
