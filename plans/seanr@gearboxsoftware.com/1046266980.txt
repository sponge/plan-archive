Plan:
Hello all.

While the rest of the team works feverishly on
polishing up Bond, I'll be traveling around
New Zealand and Australia.  I'm such a dick.

Gearbox is still kicking around the idea of moving
the company to NZ so I hope to do a little
preliminary scouting.  There are a *lot* of people
here still on the fence about such a move, but
when the time finally comes to change hemispheres
I don't want to be caught with my pants down.

I leave this Friday (the 11th) and arrive back on
the 26th.  Should be a fun vacation.  I hope to
eat lots of lamb and kangaroo.

Vegemite:  Should I try it?
