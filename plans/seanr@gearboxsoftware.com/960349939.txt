Shhh


Plan:
I'd like to second what Jeremy Statz said in his .plan earlier.
Serious Sam just blows me away.  I've seen this product several
times now, but it wasn't until Jeremy's plan update that I
decided to actually sit down and play the demo (not really a
demo... it's labeled a 'test').

I'm thoroughly impressed.  There is some very creative 
thinking going on in Serious Sam.

_All_ of the monsters are a blast, but the office favorite has 
to be the "Beheaded Kamikaze"... you really need to play it
to understand.

"Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!"
