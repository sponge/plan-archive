Shhh


Plan:
  Please, everyone, the mapper that everyone refers to as
"Rob" prefers to be called "Robbie"... I just hate seeing
that hurt look he gets when someone offhandedly calls him
"Rob"... watch your manners everyone.

  We are soo close to done it's just not funny.
  
  Xena is allready in re-runs.  Sigh.  So far, I feel this
season has been excellent.  I might even be able to tolerate
that last one if I saw it again.  Wild-west and Xena just
didn't mesh well with me.


  Careful.. you are surrounded by Gearbox..
