Shhh


Plan:
I've gotten tons of helpful e-mail about my
"Kentucky Fried Movie" plea.  But I also
got some e-mail asking me to share what I
might learn with the community.

Here goes.

http://www.anchorbayentertainment.com/schedule/dvd.html
(http://www.anchorbayentertainment.com/titles/kentuckyfriedmovie.html)

and

http://www.blackstar.co.uk//video/item/7000000055977

The link to blackstar describes the DVD as being
region 2 only.

The anchorbay link gives very little info, other than
to say that the movie will be released in June 2000.

So that's some good news.. the movie is not lost
forever.  There is an excellent chance that by
the end of this year a good many of us will have
seen the KFM in its DVD glory.


I haven't heard anything about a wide screen version
of Amazon Women on the Moon.  I'll keep my eyes
peeled.. when I see it, I'll let you know.


On an almost related note, I'd like to stir up
more feelings of nostalgia by mentioning that
I just received a copy of that ol' NES classic,
River City Ransom.  A truly awesome game that
completely blows away Double Dragon.  If you haven't
played it, see if your local FuncoLand (or the sort)
has it in stock.

So, you see, I have my time divided up between
River City Ransom and Code Veronica.  And.. uh..
work.
