 I'd like to waste your time for a few seconds, but you can early-out now
 if you aren't local to Dallas.
   I'm getting up on the soapbox to proclaim The Original Pancake house
 as the best breakfast type eatery in the North Dallas area.  If you are
 unfamiliar with the place, let me describe what you are missing out on.
 You got yourself 20 some pancake styles (flavors?) which includes
 everything from coconut to plain ol' dollar pancakes.  If you're not
 a pancake person, they got yo back with some waffles (only about four
 different waffle varieties though).
   The flagship food item of the restaurant has got to be the Dutch Baby.
 I have never seen nor heard of such a dish outside of The Original Pancake 
 house, so I don't know if you guys will know what it is I'm talking about.
 It's a eggy crepe like thing, that's cooked in the shape of a bowl.
 Once delivered, you are to fill this bowl up with butter, powered sugar,
 and lemon juice.  Then you fold it to look like a burrito, and away you go.
 These things are awesome.
   The Original Pancake House has the special property of some restaurants
 wherein every time you leave, you swear that you'll never eat again. The 
 real kicker to this story is that it's CHEAPER than IHOP or Dennys.
   If you have a free morning (the close around 2 pm) treat yourself to a
 decent breakfast.
 
 
   If anyone out there is at the ground zero deal, and you spot our booth,
 look for John.  If you see him, kick him in the shin (lightly) and tell him 
 Steve Jones told you to do it.
 
 
   And in the unlikely event that you are both reading this AND in the Athens
 Ohio area, tune in to Power 105.5.  It's, like, the shit and stuff.
 
 
   Yes, I'm tired.
