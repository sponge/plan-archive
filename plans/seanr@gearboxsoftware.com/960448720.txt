Shhh


Plan:
Anyone have any info on New Zealand?  Specifically,
I'm curious about how NZ compares to the US in terms
of:

1) Movie release dates
2) Good Internet connection availability
3) Xena cast member sightings
4) Cost of living


Thanks TONS.  We are thinking of moving Gearbox to NZ.
Well... it's just me thinking about it so far.. so don't
tell the rest of the Gearbox people about it, okay?
Shh..  I'll persuade them when the time is right.....
