Had a day trip out to Epic the other day to see what they're up to on PS2. They've been working very hard. We saw
almost the full version of UT running, (somewhat slowly - but running), and they've done it in just 7 weeks! I can't
mention many details in fear of being smitten by the big bad Sony, but it's look very good.

Welcome Mike Baldwin!!! RuneMaster is now officially a 3 person team. Mike will be helping out on the engine, before
going onto full game development. He's primarily going to be delving into Maya and writing our export tools. We're
also interviewing for our art lead at the moment, so at the last the projects on it's way.

Just got back from a great, (but exhausting), two-day meeting with the engine team in Salt Lake. We're going to produce
such a kick-ass engine for PS2! The team has some really good ideas for the engine, we should be able to produce some
very good looking games.

Cheese of the day: Brie.

We have a programming/3D applicant coming in a few minutes. I'm hoping he'll fit the bill and we can finally start 
moving forward on our game engine. We have big plans in-store for the engine, things that people haven't ever seen,
(on console or PC). More details later ;-)

Well, the PS2 dev-kit is here, I've had it for about a month now. It has a learning curve no-man has ever seen before.
I'm enjoying myself though. This machine is just mental, the power and flexibility of the hardware will keep it ahead
of the pack for years.

Cheese of the day: Edam.
