Working with Les, Brian and Brian (too many Brians...) today - tweaking
the mesh a bit and re-applying animations. Have a few more anims to go
to complete this particular bad-un's animation set for the E3 demo.

Very very busy.

If anybody in Texas happens across Kenn Hoekstra this week, make sure to
ask him to show you his new Bob Love tattoo. It's okay - he's not shy about
it and the likeness is striking! Nice job there Biess! :)
