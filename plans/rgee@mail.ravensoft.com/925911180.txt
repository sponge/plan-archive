Check out part2 of loonygames coverage on Raven's history.

Be nice to Rick today - he found out last night during our bi-monthly
AD&D game session that his dwarf character is actually a girl. Pretty
rough news.... A dwarf berzerker with an identity crisis can't be good.

As for work news: Sorry, the stuff I'm currently doing is too specific to
share with you right now. Animating stuff and loving it.

Hmmmmm... Just read MRJ's .plan update.
He seems to be suffering from some form of displaced anger or resentment, I think.
Probably because Lucas went with Warwick Davis, AGAIN! Poor Mike. Life just isn't
fair sometimes.

Working with Les, Brian and Brian (too many Brians...) today - tweaking
the mesh a bit and re-applying animations. Have a few more anims to go
to complete this particular bad-un's animation set for the E3 demo.

Very very busy.

If anybody in Texas happens across Kenn Hoekstra this week, make sure to
ask him to show you his new Bob Love tattoo. It's okay - he's not shy about
it and the likeness is striking! Nice job there Biess! :)
