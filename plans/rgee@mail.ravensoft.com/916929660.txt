If at first you don't succeed, then skydiving isn't for you.

*************************************************************************

Well, it seems Bob has tied me up and thrown me into the storage closet.
Hopefully someone will hear my muffled cries for help and let me out.
If not, the cleaning crew will find me later tonight. Oh well, looks
like I'll wait till tomorrow to destroy him... or maybe the next day. My
weekend is looking pretty full, so if not tomorrow, maybe Monday. Yeah,
Monday is good.

Hey - there's somebody else in here with me. Oh. Hi Glenn, I see he got you
too. I was wondering where you've been. I guess this isn't the cleaning
crew's storage closet is it?

damn.

When everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane and going
the wrong way.

*************************************************************************

So, Bob went and did it. He just couldn't leave well enough alone. He just
had to go and talk smack about me... well, that just figures. Bob is always
talking smack and he's always targeting friendly and honest people, like
myself, to launch his vicious attacks on. Call Me talented, will he?? Ha!
He won't get away with this I swear!

Watch your back, Dr. (g)Love! Camp Raven will be cleansed of your filthy
presence soon enough!!!! You will know pain!!! Bwahahahahah!

Understand that I don't necessarily hate Bob, nor do I blame him for what
he is. He can't help himself, you see. He has a reason for being the way
he is. It's not that he wasn't breast fed or held enough as a child. It's
not because of those genetic Illinois prejudices, or the fact that he is a
Bears fan. These are all excusable and understandable problems - many of
which a few of us have had to deal with in our own lives.

Bob's case is special. It all stems from the fact that he's inherently evil.
He is Demonspawn and sows discord and corruption wherever his path takes him.
He will always be this way and he can't stop himself. He must be destroyed
before he destroys the rest of us. Don't think I'm paranoid or an X-files
junkie - I have proof of what I say, and rest assured, steps are being taken
to resolve the situation... more on that later. Again, Bwahahahahah!

As for my natural appreciation of the mighty Kurgan?

Hmm... yes indeed, I do find myself smiling whenever I think of Kurgan.
I mean, come on, he has some endearing qualities as a film villain: He's
physically imposing, dang near unstoppable, has custom made swords, friendly
with the ladies (hi Candy), charming personality, and to top it all off: he's
immortal. Plus, you have to admit that he delivers the best lines of all time.
No one can match his style or flair for upstaging the hero. He's got it all.
Kurgan is one of the only movie villains who has ever successfully "offed" a
Sean Connery character in an action movie. That's moxy, baby.

If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried.

Whew! Seems I've been shoveling snow for two weeks straight!
Welcome to Wisconsin....

Anyway, I've finally recovered from the Heretic II experience. I'm
actually willing to begin playing other games off and on for a while.
Namely: Baldur's gate, Starcraft Brood War, AOE Rise of Rome,
Starsiege Tribes and Twisted Metal 2 (oldie but goodie). 

Currently I've been working on Soldier of Fortune - primarily designing
the game menu system graphics and layout along with the in-game
interface design. Looking good so far :) It's quite the adjustment
shifting from the high fantasy of Heretic II to the ultra real combat
worlds of SOF. Nothing like gritty realism to start the day off with.

I'm only on SOF for a little while then I'm off to the "other" project to
join up with the Packer's new assistant coach and chief advisor,
Mr. Jeff DeWitt. We'll be doing most of the animations for the project.
Can't say what it's about, but fear not - because being afraid sucks.
Just like mean people suck.

Speaking of which, Bob Love says "hi" to all of you but can't talk right
now, he's leaving for the big 28th Annual Clodhopper & Winter Barn
Dance shin dig in Sheboygan - that's Bob for ya, always on the go....

CD of the month - Creed, My Own Prison
Action Game of the year - Heretic II, believe it baby!
