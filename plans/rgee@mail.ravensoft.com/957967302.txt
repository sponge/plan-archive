We'll be presenting Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force at E3 this year in the South Hall at the
Activision booth. Swing by and check it out - one of the levels we'll be showing is 90% curves
and really shows off the QuakeIII engine's capabilities. I'll be there with Brian Raffel and
Rick Johnson (The two codgers. Oops, I mean Veterans) for the afternoon shifts. Kim Lathrop
(Trek Lord) and Joe Koberstein (Gore Zone) will be there in the mornings. We'll also be showing
the multiplayer Holomatch levels along with our Trek Universe bots.

Big fun will be had by all.
