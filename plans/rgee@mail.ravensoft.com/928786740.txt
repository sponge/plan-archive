Forget about World Peace.....Visualize Using Your Turn Signal!

Been working on the scavenger models (4 variations with 3
different possible poly counts) and should be done with them
soon. Point weighting should take quite a while, but using one
skeletong system (see CHIMAERA - eturman's plan updates)
should make it all come together rather quickly.

As for other things - James Cameron is no longer KING OF THE
WORLD! I guess George gets the title for a little while now.

Menace Sinks Titanic Record

As expected, Star Wars: Episode One : The Phantom Menace sank
one of Titanics box office records this last weekend. In fact,
Phantom managed to do in 19 days what it took Titanic to make
in 36 days: $250 million. In the end, Phantom pulled in an
additional $32.2M bringing its current box office take up to
over $255M. Not only did it take Titanics record, but in the
process Phantom became  the 12th highest grossing film of all
time - all in just three weeks.

Check out part2 of loonygames coverage on Raven's history.

Be nice to Rick today - he found out last night during our bi-monthly
AD&D game session that his dwarf character is actually a girl. Pretty
rough news.... A dwarf berzerker with an identity crisis can't be good.

As for work news: Sorry, the stuff I'm currently doing is too specific to
share with you right now. Animating stuff and loving it.

Hmmmmm... Just read MRJ's .plan update.
He seems to be suffering from some form of displaced anger or resentment, I think.
Probably because Lucas went with Warwick Davis, AGAIN! Poor Mike. Life just isn't
fair sometimes.

Make sure to check out Inside Raven over at loonygames.com

Working with Les, Brian and Brian (too many Brians...) today - tweaking
the mesh a bit and re-applying animations. Have a few more anims to go
to complete this particular bad-un's animation set for the E3 demo.

Very very busy.

If anybody in Texas happens across Kenn Hoekstra this week, make sure to
ask him to show you his new Bob Love tattoo. It's okay - he's not shy about
it and the likeness is striking! Nice job there Biess! :)
