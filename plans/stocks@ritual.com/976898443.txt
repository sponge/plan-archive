I would like to comment on the Alli/Brooke situation that our Hog_Jonny is involved in.  

I live with Jon and I remember that night very well.  A few things our fearless Project Manager left out was that Alli came over to our place earlier that night while he was "away".  She knocked at the door and I of course answered.  She told me of her precarious situation and I told her that while I certainly can try to help out I think it would be better if Jon took "care" of her.  Why didn't I jump at the situation?  Well because I am not a "playa Hata" and I knew Jon was working the angle. I decided that a true friend would let the person who has done all the work continue. 

But let me also say that Jon decided to help them out without inviting me over there.  Here I am sitting all alone in the Apt. and he goes over there for many, many hours hogging up all the action.  No wonder why they call him "Hog_Jonny". :)

BTW - the email is not Stocks@ritual.com it's Chris@ritual.com.

Oh and I picked up Vagrant Story last night.

So I got to the final boss in Final Fantasy 9 and low and behold I got my ass kicked up and down.  I think this could be the hardest end battle in the PSX Final Fantasy series.  Nothing beats the end boss in Final Fantasy 2 (American SNES version).  I have been somewhat pleased with FF9 but not overly blown away by the story.  Plus I feel it's somewhat short (I am on the 37th hour).  But all in all it's been a pretty good experience.  Do you all remember Xenogears and Final Fantasy Tactics?  Now those two games were #@$@#$@%@# excellent.  It took me over 60 hours to beat Xeno, while I played over 40 hours to beat tactics.  Plus I can remember the music in Tactics was the best I had ever heard at that time.  I just got so pumped up whenever I entered a battle area.  

Xenogears was a much different story altogether.  While I have never been a huge mech fan, I thought the story was very, very well done.  I loved the fact that it questioned God and creation.  I believe games should dig deep in social issues much like movies do.  Games that make you think about what is right and wrong. 

I think after I am done with FF9 I will move on to Skies of Arcadia and Grandia 2. So many games to play yet so little time.  I think thats every developer's problem.
