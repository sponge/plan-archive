Pre-New Years Edition

Well now everything has gone to hell.  Let's see I just got Grandia 2 for Christmas (Josh you are the best dude!!!) And Lunar 2!!! 

I have yet beaten the last dude in FF9 and it's already Wed. already.  

Arrrggghhhhh!!!!

Well looks like the remainder of the week is going to be a marathon of games, sex (well maybe not that), booze (Crown Royale here I come!!!).  Hope I will be alive come Tuesday morning.

Thanks to all that replied with there anwser to my GBA question I asked earlier.

Well I still haven't beaten the last boss in FF9.  But I am determined to kill him (it?!).  So I figured I will concentrate on the it during the Christmas break.  

Friends keep telling me to play Skies of Arcadia after I finish FF9.  I have the game and I figured I should play it after I finish Vagrant Story and Chrono Cross.  But after hearing some of the cooler elements to Skies I may have to change the order a bit.  

What does everybody think of Grandia 2?  I have heard mixed opinions and I don't know if it's worth playing.  

We had our Christmas party a couple of days ago.  The gag presents were quite funny.  I ended up with Lego!  Jon ended up with a bottle of Tequila (which is now gone!!). Jon loves his Tequila!!! :)

Well Merry Christmas everybody.  Hope everybody gets what they want (don't forget to give too!!)

Went over to Paradox's house warming party over the weekend.  Lotsa beer, beer, and more beer.  Had plenty of stimulating conversations with some 2015 guys that were down for the big CPL event going on out here in Dallas.  

The debate about who will win the next console battle rages on.  Many people think X-Box has got the war won already.  Others think Sony has such a huge name that they will be king. And still others think that Nintendo may pull a fast one and come out on top where they once held the position so many moons ago.

What do I think?  Honestly I have no idea.  But I do know this, it's a great time to be a gamer.  With so many choices companies will need to be price competitive and have good content in order to survive.  There is no clear cut winner this time.  

But if I had to make a choice I would have to go with the company that I grew up on.  Nintendo.  I have always had a soft spot in my heart for the Big "N" and I just don't see them going away anytime soon.  They have craploads of money and plenty of time on there hand as Pokemon continues to sell by the truckloads.  What gamer wouldn't buy a new Mario, Zelda, Metroid (about time), Star Wars, or any other big Nintendo brand. 

Plus remember that they are now switching to a much cheaper, industry standard medium.  With the Gameboy Advance being released next year and I am sure Nintendo will make it as interactive as it can be with the Cube.  Who wouldn't buy a GameCube game that interacted with a really awesome GBA game.  

1 Question for you all.  What would you all think of a really simple, scaled down RTS game for the GBA?  I mean one in which the battles took less than a half-hour (wouldn't want everybody to go blind)?  Let me know if you would buy one at Chris@ritual.com

I would like to comment on the Alli/Brooke situation that our Hog_Jonny is involved in.  

I live with Jon and I remember that night very well.  A few things our fearless Project Manager left out was that Alli came over to our place earlier that night while he was "away".  She knocked at the door and I of course answered.  She told me of her precarious situation and I told her that while I certainly can try to help out I think it would be better if Jon took "care" of her.  Why didn't I jump at the situation?  Well because I am not a "playa Hata" and I knew Jon was working the angle. I decided that a true friend would let the person who has done all the work continue. 

But let me also say that Jon decided to help them out without inviting me over there.  Here I am sitting all alone in the Apt. and he goes over there for many, many hours hogging up all the action.  No wonder why they call him "Hog_Jonny". :)

BTW - the email is not Stocks@ritual.com it's Chris@ritual.com.

Oh and I picked up Vagrant Story last night.

So I got to the final boss in Final Fantasy 9 and low and behold I got my ass kicked up and down.  I think this could be the hardest end battle in the PSX Final Fantasy series.  Nothing beats the end boss in Final Fantasy 2 (American SNES version).  I have been somewhat pleased with FF9 but not overly blown away by the story.  Plus I feel it's somewhat short (I am on the 37th hour).  But all in all it's been a pretty good experience.  Do you all remember Xenogears and Final Fantasy Tactics?  Now those two games were #@$@#$@%@# excellent.  It took me over 60 hours to beat Xeno, while I played over 40 hours to beat tactics.  Plus I can remember the music in Tactics was the best I had ever heard at that time.  I just got so pumped up whenever I entered a battle area.  

Xenogears was a much different story altogether.  While I have never been a huge mech fan, I thought the story was very, very well done.  I loved the fact that it questioned God and creation.  I believe games should dig deep in social issues much like movies do.  Games that make you think about what is right and wrong. 

I think after I am done with FF9 I will move on to Skies of Arcadia and Grandia 2. So many games to play yet so little time.  I think thats every developer's problem.
