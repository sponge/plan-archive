Thanks to all the people that sent me ideas of where to go in Dallas!!!

Let's see, this morning I actually started a new workout regimen.  Now this has been the upteenth time I have tried to workout at the gym on a regular basis but I really feel this time it will be different since I have a guide to show me the proper exercises to do.  Who is this new guide you may ask?  

Well it's actually a cutout from a magazine article I read over the weekend.  Men's Health is the mag. and in the newest issue they show people who have never worked out before or are just newbies how to build strength up doing key exercises.  According to the mag the first phase (which is what I am in right now) lasts 8 weeks and you should start seeing results after the first 3.  In the March issue they will describe Phase 2.  I think my problem in the past has been that I never knew exactly what to do.  Sure I would stumble around on the machines for 20 or so minutes but we all know that the real way to build up strength is to use free-weights and I was scared to death of them.  Well after reading the article it showed me the proper techniques and now I am confident that I can stick with it.  

I wasn't able to finish Lunar 2 over the weekend.  But I am on Disc 2, hopefully by the end of this week I will have moved on the Vagrant Story or Chrono Cross (still deciding).

I had heard over the weekend that the XBox will probably cost more than PS2. Why on Earth would Microsoft think that people will choose the XBox over the PS2 (if it indeed costs more)?  XBox isn't that much of a difference over the PS2 and by then Sony will have lowered the price to say 250 or so.  Why would the mass consumer market choose a console from a company that's synonmous with software and geeky, when they could buy a less expensive console from a company that is well known for cool electronics and cool video games?  Sony's name and a great marketing plan is what drove the mass market to buy into the PSX franchise.  Microsoft can spend as much money as they want on marketing but the consumer's perception of a company and there products is just as important.  And if XBox launches at a higher price point I just don't see the mass market choosing it over the PS2.   

Price and software are the two largest issues that consumers care about when it comes to purchasing a console.  Not features.  Just look at Gameboy.  So if the price is high there better be some damn cool games that people must purchase an XBox in order to play. So far I only know of 1 game that is completely XBox exclusive.  Munch's Oddysee.  I am sorry but that game is not going to sell XBox units.  Sure EA is developing for it but remember they are huge PS2 supporters as well. 

Now I am not saying XBox will fail, Sony should be somewhat scared because XBox is less than a year away and people still can't find PS2's anywhere.  And I have heard that most people won't be able to find any until early-spring.  So that looks very good for MS, but launching at a higher price point than 300 is suicide.  Name one console that has survived that was priced above 300?  3DO?  Neo Geo?  If Bill Gates thinks he can buy his way into the console game industry he is sorely mistaken.

Rant of the day:

Someone please explain to me why there are 99% more bars than Dance clubs in Dallas, TX?  Don't people like to dance out here?  Finding a decent dance club out here is like finding Country music in my CD collection.  You can look all you want but you just won't find it.  People here for some reason enjoy sitting down (although you can usually only stand up cause it's so damn crowded) and drinking away there problems.  

The funny thing is that they play the type of music I like (which is trance, techno,etc) but no dance floors.  Oh and get this, one club I know has a dance floor the size of kitchen.  Now how in the hell is anybody supposed to dance when there isn't any room? 

In Salt Lake City though their are a ton of dance clubs.  Now this just doesn't make sense to me at all.  Why in mormonville (I have nothing against mormons mind you)  that they know more about shaking your booty than Dallas?  

If anybody lives in the Dallas area and knows of any DANCE clubs that play TECHNO music please drop me a line at chris@ritual.com

Oh and what does everybody think of the XBox design?  Personally I think sticking that big ugly logo on the controllers is a huge aesthetics mistake.  The big "X" on the console is kinda cool though.  And at least they decided to stick 4 controller ports on the thing instead of the horribly uncool 2 (shame on Sony).  Now let's just see what price point they decide to launch at.  Anything over 300 and they will be shooting themselves in the foot.   

Oh and I want to give a big hug and hello to KW!  I miss you!!!!

Till next time,

Be Safe

Happy New Year!!!

I hope everybody had a safe New Years!  

I would like to give a huge thanks to the fine folks over at GoD for a kick-ass New Year's Party down in Austin, TX.  Jon, Josh (the Galloway twins, and Kathryn (Josh's girlfriend), and I drive down Sunday mid-afternoon (just before all the snow came), checked into a Four Points Sheraton and proceeded to the club privately reserved for the party.  We arrived at an early time of 10 pm and began the drinking immediately.  Now I normally don't do a whole hell of a lot of drinking (even at parties) but an open bar is too much of a temptation.  So I began the night with a few Mandarin Screwdrivers, then took in many Crown Sours, a few Ace Pear Ale's and rounded the night with a couple of Malibu and Coke's.

Umm I don't remember too much after that as all the alcohol started settling in.  But I need to give another huge thanks to Kathryn for driving all of us safely back to the hotel.  

Oh the one thing I do remember is spewing chunks outside for the whole world to see. 

But thank the lord that the next morning I wasn't hung-over as we had to drive back to Dallas at noon.  

I am still playing Lunar 2, but hopefully will be done by Sunday or so.  I'll let everybody know how it is when I am finished.  

It is going to take me forever and a day to pay off my Christmas bills but you can help me out by buying Blair Witch 3: The Elly Kedward Tale.   It's really a decent game given the price point.  So go out to your local EB or Babbage's and pick up copies for your whole family (they make great post-Christmas gifts)  :)

Let's see I bought a copy of Tetris for the DC the other day.  I got one word to describe it:  Disappointing

Tell me something please, why make a tetris game that only incorporates multi-player support in the "new and updated" version (which sucks ass BTW).  No multi-player support in the classic version of the game.  None.  And the point system is horrible as well.  I play tetris because I want to get a high school, I want to make as many tetris's as possible so that my score can sky-rocket.  But the developers decided that points aren't important so their is basically no advantage to making tetris's.  Worthless.  I go by the motto "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".  Remember Tetris for the GameBoy?  In that version making tetris's would bring much more points than just clearing 1 or 2 lines.  On top of that playing multiplayer was a blast because when one person made a tetris, a couple of lines would appear on the other player's screen (which increased the difficulty).  Now I know that Crave couldn't copy the mechanics of the GB tetris code by code.  But Jesus, please don't change the fundamentals of why Tetris is fun in the first damn place.  Avoid like the plague. 

On to some good news now. I finally beat the end bitc ooops I mean boss in FF9.  Yes the battle was somewhat difficult before but after I completed the Chocobo side-quest I was able to conquer that beeyatch pretty easily.  The ending was fairly good and even the end credits weren't boring to watch.  Speaking of which it's amazing how many people worked on that game as it definately rivals Hollywood productions. 

Well now I am on to Lunar 2.  So far it has been a good experience, I mean it doesn't hold a candle to the graphics in Square's opus but it's not supposed too.  It's a great old-school, fun, RPG.  I highly recommend to anyone that is fond of the old-school RPG's.

After that I will play Vagrant Story and Chrono Cross and then finish up with Front Mission 3 before moving on to all the DC RPG's.   

Well Happy New YEar everyone, be safe and I will talk to you all next year!!!

Pre-New Years Edition

Well now everything has gone to hell.  Let's see I just got Grandia 2 for Christmas (Josh you are the best dude!!!) And Lunar 2!!! 

I have yet beaten the last dude in FF9 and it's already Wed. already.  

Arrrggghhhhh!!!!

Well looks like the remainder of the week is going to be a marathon of games, sex (well maybe not that), booze (Crown Royale here I come!!!).  Hope I will be alive come Tuesday morning.

Thanks to all that replied with there anwser to my GBA question I asked earlier.

Well I still haven't beaten the last boss in FF9.  But I am determined to kill him (it?!).  So I figured I will concentrate on the it during the Christmas break.  

Friends keep telling me to play Skies of Arcadia after I finish FF9.  I have the game and I figured I should play it after I finish Vagrant Story and Chrono Cross.  But after hearing some of the cooler elements to Skies I may have to change the order a bit.  

What does everybody think of Grandia 2?  I have heard mixed opinions and I don't know if it's worth playing.  

We had our Christmas party a couple of days ago.  The gag presents were quite funny.  I ended up with Lego!  Jon ended up with a bottle of Tequila (which is now gone!!). Jon loves his Tequila!!! :)

Well Merry Christmas everybody.  Hope everybody gets what they want (don't forget to give too!!)

Went over to Paradox's house warming party over the weekend.  Lotsa beer, beer, and more beer.  Had plenty of stimulating conversations with some 2015 guys that were down for the big CPL event going on out here in Dallas.  

The debate about who will win the next console battle rages on.  Many people think X-Box has got the war won already.  Others think Sony has such a huge name that they will be king. And still others think that Nintendo may pull a fast one and come out on top where they once held the position so many moons ago.

What do I think?  Honestly I have no idea.  But I do know this, it's a great time to be a gamer.  With so many choices companies will need to be price competitive and have good content in order to survive.  There is no clear cut winner this time.  

But if I had to make a choice I would have to go with the company that I grew up on.  Nintendo.  I have always had a soft spot in my heart for the Big "N" and I just don't see them going away anytime soon.  They have craploads of money and plenty of time on there hand as Pokemon continues to sell by the truckloads.  What gamer wouldn't buy a new Mario, Zelda, Metroid (about time), Star Wars, or any other big Nintendo brand. 

Plus remember that they are now switching to a much cheaper, industry standard medium.  With the Gameboy Advance being released next year and I am sure Nintendo will make it as interactive as it can be with the Cube.  Who wouldn't buy a GameCube game that interacted with a really awesome GBA game.  

1 Question for you all.  What would you all think of a really simple, scaled down RTS game for the GBA?  I mean one in which the battles took less than a half-hour (wouldn't want everybody to go blind)?  Let me know if you would buy one at Chris@ritual.com

I would like to comment on the Alli/Brooke situation that our Hog_Jonny is involved in.  

I live with Jon and I remember that night very well.  A few things our fearless Project Manager left out was that Alli came over to our place earlier that night while he was "away".  She knocked at the door and I of course answered.  She told me of her precarious situation and I told her that while I certainly can try to help out I think it would be better if Jon took "care" of her.  Why didn't I jump at the situation?  Well because I am not a "playa Hata" and I knew Jon was working the angle. I decided that a true friend would let the person who has done all the work continue. 

But let me also say that Jon decided to help them out without inviting me over there.  Here I am sitting all alone in the Apt. and he goes over there for many, many hours hogging up all the action.  No wonder why they call him "Hog_Jonny". :)

BTW - the email is not Stocks@ritual.com it's Chris@ritual.com.

Oh and I picked up Vagrant Story last night.  


12/14/00

So I got to the final boss in Final Fantasy 9 and low and behold I got my ass kicked up and down.  I think this could be the hardest end battle in the PSX Final Fantasy series.  Nothing beats the end boss in Final Fantasy 2 (American SNES version).  I have been somewhat pleased with FF9 but not overly blown away by the story.  Plus I feel it's somewhat short (I am on the 37th hour).  But all in all it's been a pretty good experience.  Do you all remember Xenogears and Final Fantasy Tactics?  Now those two games were #@$@#$@%@# excellent.  It took me over 60 hours to beat Xeno, while I played over 40 hours to beat tactics.  Plus I can remember the music in Tactics was the best I had ever heard at that time.  I just got so pumped up whenever I entered a battle area.  

Xenogears was a much different story altogether.  While I have never been a huge mech fan, I thought the story was very, very well done.  I loved the fact that it questioned God and creation.  I believe games should dig deep in social issues much like movies do.  Games that make you think about what is right and wrong. 

I think after I am done with FF9 I will move on to Skies of Arcadia and Grandia 2. So many games to play yet so little time.  I think thats every developer's problem.
