   The Heretic II EP is almost there.  QA and we are both hammering
on one tiny remaining bug.  Thanks to all the beta testers for all
their assistance, support and patience!
 
   I forgot to mention, I'm going to be heading on up to GamesCon
in Toronto, Canada next weekend!  The show, if people aren't familiar
with it, is a pretty sizable event that aims to turn itself into
an "E3 for gamers".  There will be a huge number of computers set
up to run all sorts of games, including Heretic II.  They tell me
that Unreal Tournament will have its first public display there, 
along with some other impressive titles as well.
   I'll be there speaking about a yet-undetermined topic, as well as
sitting on a big panel on breaking into the gaming industry.  Other 
You'll also be able to see Johnny Wilson, LevelLord, Zoid, and
good ol' Blue, not to mention some other impressive folks that I
don't know if I can mention or not.  Should be pretty fun.
   I expected a little LAN event when I first heard about it, but
now they're thinking they may see up to 10,000 people over the three 
days (Feb 26-28).  Cool stuff, I'm honored to be a part of it.  See 
you there if you go!

Later,
Pat
