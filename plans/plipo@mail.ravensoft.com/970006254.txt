Wow...  It's been a long time since I've updated this.  I guess
my 30th birthday last week really made me think about the stuff
I've been neglecting...  :-)  

Now that I'm a creaky old "trigenarian", I'll try to keep this more 
up to date, honest!  Really, for real this time. :-)  I'm even going
to finish up my web page so I can put it up.  I'm hoping to get 
some content regarding the things that I have learned about game
development in the past seven years.  Not necessarily technical 
stuff, just overall lessons that became apparent as I went from
project to project.  A while back I tried to maintain a doc of 
advice for aspiring game developers, but unforunately didn't have 
the time to follow through.  This time I'd like to make good.  
Any suggestions would be appreciated...  <a href="mailto:plipo@ravensoft.com">plipo@ravensoft.com</a>

Anyway, things have been pretty quiet around the Raven front lately,
thank goodness.  It's been a real relief after a pretty-much nonstop 
year...  Crunch time on Soldier of Fortune bled directly into crunch
time on Elite Force for a small group of exhausted Ravenites, of 
which I was a member.  Ste made me feel a little better when he 
chastised: "It's your own faults for making yourselves so useful." 
(or something like that, it was very late at night.)

However, we (Keith and Dan and Jake and Chris Reed and I) just did 
all the multiplayer stuff.  Of course the real accomplishment goes 
to the  full-time Elite Force team...  a great group of people who 
pulled off a game that came as close to a movie (in production and 
in the end product) as I've ever been involved with!

Today, we just got a brand new Crisis Zone machine in our break room.
Man, what an intense game.  It really gets the blood pumping and 
keeps us thinking about new ways to make our games even cooler.  
Thanks to Brian Raffel and Activision for a little Raven 10th 
anniversary present!

But things are pretty quiet, as I said, and everything is ramping up 
slowly, including MY project (thank goodness!).  The Playstation 2 
is a bucking bronco that the programming team, Jake, Gil and 
especially Marcus, are taming quite adeptly.  Our new game is going
to blow you all away.  I've also been thinking a lot about the games 
Raven is planning, and this is probably the most excited I've ever 
been during my time here.  It's going to be quite a year!
