By popular request, I put together some basic documentation and
samples that can be used for weather effects and vertigons
(surfacesprites) for people making mods and/or maps for JK2 and 
SOF2.

Rick Johnson's worldeffects system has some calls for creating 
in-view rain and snow, as well as misty-foggy stuff.  These can
be added to maps by adding commands to the worldspawn.

My vertigon system is used to add grass, shrubbery, vines, mist,
and rain splashes to a surface with culling at a distance.  It's 
really easy to do, it merely requires editing the shader of
whatever surface you wish to add vertigons to.  The system is 
pretty cheap for what it does, and we only scratched the surface
of its potential while making SOF2 and JK2.

Both technologies are more or less synchronized between JK2SP, 
JK2MP, SOF2SP, and SOF2MP, so the documents and sample shaders 
are more or less transferable.  The only thing SOF2 has that JK2
doesn't are some additional directives for gore and the like. 
Using the improvements you can do sprites on people as well as 
terrain polygons, such as placing rain-splashes on the dudes with
the rain slickers (I was a bit too busy with my other project to 
squeeze that into the liner level, darn it).  

The vertigons were also used in SOF2 for projecting gore on 
characters.  For some simple examples, SOF2MP mod-makers can add 
new gore decals (both 2D and 3D) by working with the module
cg_gore.c.

The file for all this goodness can be found at my goofy little
<a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/users/plipo">Cyclones Cinematic Shrine.</a>

For those of you who would rather eat glass than be subjected to 
the horrors that were the Cyclones cinematics, the direct link to
the file is <a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/users/plipo/JK2SOF2 Vertigon and Weather Tech.zip">here</a>.

Happy splattering!  And raining...  And grassing...  And misting...
