   Hey all:

   I've been a busy beaver, really getting involved in our next
project in the past weeks.  It's been a real rollercoaster of 
writing up proposals, fleshing out ideas, and getting feedback
from all interested parties.  It's new territory for some, old hat
for others, but I almost guarantee it's not what you think.  I've 
been involved to a small extent in Heretic II's version 1.05, but 
Jake has really taken the brunt of the task.  He's been really 
great at coordinating with testers and handling all the little 
issues that have cropped up, thanks mate.

   Well, the reason I'm here, however, is that Jake is on vacation
this week and I wanted to make sure everyone was up to speed with 
what's going on with Heretic II as well.  With the release of 
v1.05 there arose a bug with downloading and dedicated servers.
This bug had been hiding there for a long time, but for some 
reason it got really aggrivated with this most recent release.  
The problem occurs when clients try to connect to a dedicated 
server with all the download options on, causing a crash.  All 
downloading did work properly with a listen server, so 
unfortunately this issue slipped through the QA process.

   Many people attributed this to old versions like v1.04 being 
allowed to connect to v1.05 servers.  We had left the two versions
able to network together because the fixes we made were largely
server side.  There were a couple of client fixes, but there was
nothing which would prevent a v1.04 client and v1.05 server from
working together, or a v1.05 client on a v1.04 server.  We figured
that not forcing the upgrade would make the transition easier.

   However, it seems that folks that put up servers would rather
be certain that their players have the new version.  So, with the
new version, v1.06, an upgrade will be required to play on a v1.06
server.  In addition, I also fixed the dedicated downloading 
problem (coordinating a client-server architecture can be a bitch
sometimes).  QA is almost ready with testing this new version,
and we will be getting it to you as soon as possible.  

   In addition to the full patch and the EP-to-1.06 patch, I have
also updated the full Toolkit patch, and made a new EP-to-1.06
Toolkit patch (although if you are using the EP-to-1.05 patch 
already, you shouldn't need more than a couple fo files from 
this).  

   Finally, as an additional "peace offering", I asked Jon Zuk 
to pick four of the .MAP files from our deathmatch maps for novice 
map-makers to look at and learn from:
   DMCLOUD (by Matt Pinkston, from the Retail Version)
   DMCITADEL (by Greg Barr, from the Xmas Map Pack)
   DMJERSEY (by "Jersey" Jim Hughes, from the Enhancement Pack)
   DMLIGHT (by Jeremy Statz, from the Enhancement Pack)

   Anyway, we are getting everything together, so you can expect 
this release within a few days.  Thanks for your patience.

Later,
Pat
