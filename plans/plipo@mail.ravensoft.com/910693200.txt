    It really scares me when I realize that the string cheese I just
bought at the store has a later expiration date than the Pepsi I'm 
drinking...
    Just waiting for yet another build to push up to Activision QA before
the Pacific coast wakes up and the Internet slows to a crawl... :-)  We're
really, really close with Heretic II.  The game is looking fantastic.  
We've had time to really tweak out the gameplay, and the weapons in
particular.  We have to be careful with that one.  People were taken aback
by the lethality of the weapons in HticII deathmatch, but we had to take
care with handling that issue.  Other than making sure there are no 
definitive "cheap" weapons, we found that the fast, high-intensity 
conflict portrayed in the demo was by far the best way to play.  However,
for those people who want a bit more of a lengthy fight, the damage can
be scaled for higher survival.  Prepare for a fierce fiesta of fabulous
fantasy fighting!
    We've just got a few tiny issues to deal with before signing off on
the game.  Jake and John are thrashing the hardware end of things, Josh and
Mike are touching up monsters and the player, Bob's cleaning up all the 
cinematics, Marcus is putting the final touches on coop-play and the camera,
everyone's kicking ass.  The SOF team deserves special kudos, in particular
Rick and Eric.  Both have been staying up all hours of the night with us to 
help us ship this game.  They're not part of the core team, but they take 
just as much pride in any Raven game as they do their own.  Very cool.
    Anyway, it's just about dawn.  I'd better drive home before stoplights
cease flashing yellow...

    All right, all right, enough already!  I musta been crazy when
I wrote that plan update giving an "example" of what it would be like
to download custom models, because people innundated me with a proper
description of how custom models would work.  Gimme a break!  I'd gotten
about 12 hours of sleep in five days, I was nuts, smokin' dope, whatever! :-)
    Yes, I know how custom models work (they can load between levels, etc,
etc), but what I very poorly (VERY poorly) was trying to illustrate 
was that our model is just plain too intricate and damn huge (1500 frames)
to hope to require people to download on the fly, even between levels.  Not 
too many people play on connections that scoff at 3MB downloads, even if 
the data were compressed.
    Also these extra models would take up lotsa memory.  We're taxing the 
Quake model paradigm to its absolute extreme, folks.  SOF and future Raven
products will likely be moving to a purely skelton-oriented approach.  The
vertex-frame approach was better for software renderers than for pure
GL games anyway.  
    So model download might only work as a feature for the uber-elite.  
So, I'll just get custom skins to y'all for now.  The custom model stuff is 
a task for another day.  I'll see if that feature can be dealt with a little 
later...
    We're really, really close to shipping Heretic II!!!!  I can taste it!
Oh, man, 12 months of crunch time and I'm ready for a little break.  The
response from the net has been fantastic.  I see us not having much of
a presence in the print media, but that is partially because our E3 presence
was kinda muted.  The quick-turnaround internet audience makes a much
better gauge...
    I tell you, once we have a hyper-popular product, I'm going to have
to commence referring to myself by my new pretentious net handle,
CodeKing(tm)!  I mean it!  Really!!!
    Hmmm...  You laugh at CodeKing(tm).  CodeKing(tm) has work to do.
