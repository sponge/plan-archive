    I'd like to take this moment to congratulate four Ravenites
who celebrate their three-year anniversary this past week:

--Chia Chin Lee, one half of our sound and music powerhouse!
--Tom Odell, Designer Extraordinaire!
--John Scott, Master Programmer & Hardware Guru!
--Marcus Whitlock, also Master Programmer & Networking God!

These four gents (must've been a busy week three years ago) are 
now sporting their own Raven jackets, the coveted fashion item
that serves as but a small token of our appreciation for their
hard work...  they're worth a thousand of 'em. :-)

Interestingly, a small detail came up when these coats were
handed out.  Somebody did the math, and it turns out that the
average employee here at Raven has been with us for 3.6 years!
That's pretty damn impressive for a company of 50 people.  I'd
have to say that I feel lucky to be a part of a company that 
can attract and keep top talent the way that Raven has managed
to.  From what I know from my seven years here, there's no better 
group of people to work with in the industry.  Unfortunately, now 
I'm not the only one with a cool coat around here! :-)
