    The beta is going AWESOME.  The guys have been extremely 
helpful so far in their suggestions and in rooting out bugs.  I've
been finding that I've had to hold back on doing absolutely every-
thing we've come up with for fear of NEVER getting done with the
EP, but trust me, there's plenty there.  The EP will be done
soon, and it will be worth the wait, in most of the beta tester's
eyes.
    I just finished the code that handles all the coop and single
player skin/model limitations.  As Steve Stringer said, you can't 
normally play anyone but Corvus in single play, and Coop won't
allow you to select any model/skin that doesn't have all three
plague levels created for it.
    However, it is completely flexible.  If anyone creates a skin
that just happens to have all three plague levels, or if someone
creates plague skins for any skins that are already there, such
as Demon or Soultaker, then they will instantly be available for 
coop play.  
    Kiera and her "sister skin", Domino, both have the requisite 
plague skins created for them, so if you wish to play them in 
cooperative play, you can.  Coop players are very tolerant, so
it should be an accepted fact that the cinematics will still be
using Corvus, regardless of how many women are in the group.  
This is the story of Corvus at its heart after all...  Plus
creation and distribution of the extra resources for Kiera's 
story is somewhat prohibitive.
    By the way, I also just added in another little "extra", 
in the same vein as the "secret" first person mode I have described.
If you set the "allowillegalskins" console server variable to 1, 
then that server will allow players to use any skin at all.  That
way, if you really want to play Patchwork in coop, you can.
    Some more information about skin selection, particularly the
"nude skin", you should note that there is only skin downloading,
not uploading, supported by the Quake 2 engine and Heretic II.
That way, it is up to a server whether they want to support any
risque skins that might be created.  And if someone objects to
a skin that's used, they can easily go to another server.
    Anyway, 5AM is a bad time to be at work on a Saturday night.
I'm going to upload the next Beta-test build and head outta here.

Later,
CodeKing(tm)(R)(c) :-)
