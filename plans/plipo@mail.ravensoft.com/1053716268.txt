At last!  The word is out and I don't have to pretend that I'm
working on something else.  X-Men Legends is the name, if you've
picked up the latest Game Informer or checked out links like <a href="http://ps2.ign.com/articles/386/386798p1.html">this</a>.
It's been a long haul for me to finally have a chance to lead this 
baby, and I can honestly say that this is the most excited I've 
ever been about any game Raven has worked on.  The chance to break 
new ground for Raven, for the X-Men, and for RPG's in general is a 
fantastic opportunity that makes me feel humbled yet completely 
stoked.  

So!  As you might have seen, we've previously <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/jobs.html">posted ads</a> up on the
<a href="http://www.ravensoft.com">Raven Website</a> for some new positions we're filling for 
X-Men Legends, including a <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/jobs.html">Console Tech Programmer</a>, a <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/jobs.html">Character
Combat Programmer</a>, a <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/jobs.html">Cinematic Animator</a>, a <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/jobs.html">Level Artist</a> and a 
<a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/jobs.html">Technical Artist</a>.  If not, I invite you to <a href="http://www.ravensoft.com/jobs.html">check them out</a>
before the remaining open positions disappear.

Many of these positions require previous console game experience, 
but I wanted to add another position to the list and encourage 
people that really love games to apply:  

Junior Game Programmer:
Raven Software is seeking a talented programmer to join the staff
to work on such games as X-Men Legends and other cool titles in 
progress at Raven.  We are looking for an enthusiastic individual 
who can learn quickly, thrive in a team-oriented atmosphere, and 
add his or her creativity and programming flair to any game's 
development.

The ideal candidate would have:
--Experience writing code in a professional, group, and/or large-
  scale application environment.
--Excellent oral and written communications skills.
--A good demonstration of programming ability and drive to make
  games, such as an independent game project, mod, or other 
  such effort.
--Proven work that demonstrates an ability to learn and work 
  independently without the need for supervision.

Additional strong assets:
--Bachelorâ€™s Degree or better in Computer Science, 
  Engineering, or Mathematics.
--Full mastery of C++ and working with as well as creating 
  object-oriented systems.
--Previous experience with developing any real-time graphics 
  product.

What I'm looking for here is someone who lives and breathes games,
and really wants to be a part of Raven and the great things we're 
working on.  This position is full-time and permanent, and 
requires relocation to Madison, Wisconsin.  Please submit resumes
and other materials to Mike Crowns, <a href="mailto:mcrowns@ravensoft.com">mcrowns@ravensoft.com</a>.

Finally, if anyone has interest in discussing X-Men Legends, we've 
also added a forum for it on the <a href="http://forums.ravensoft.com/ib/ikonboard.pl">Raven Software Message Boards</a>, so 
enjoy!

Anyway, back to work.  Thanks for listening...
