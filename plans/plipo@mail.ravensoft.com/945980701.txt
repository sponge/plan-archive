    I just got a cool holiday card from Andrew Shiozaki at SquareSoft/EA.
That is cool enough in itself, but the greatest thing is the snazzy
"Santa Chocobo" that adorns the back.  I even managed to make Nathan
jealous with that one...  Yeah!  Thanks Andrew!
    Of course the absolute GREATEST thing is what I got today to put
on my desktop.  A kick-ass toy just in time for the holidays!  What 
the heck is it?  Wouldn't you like to know...? :-)
