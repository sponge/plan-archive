    Hmmm... Whatta way to spend the first few hours of my birthday...
...making the installer for Soldier of Fortune.  Eh, I'm not
complaining though, it's a nice break from writing storylines and
spec'ing out technology.

    Actually I hadn't played Soldier of Fortune in a couple of months, 
having been doing various things for "Project Z".  Man, the new stuff 
they have in SoF is fantastic!  I'm really getting excited about the 
game and what the team has accomplished.  Great job everyone!

    Just picked up my Dreamcast.  Showed up at Software Etc. at 
7AM, and waited 90 minutes for them to sell systems to all of a 
dozen people (ya think maybe they should use a computerized 
preorder system?!?).  Sigh.  Waiting in line for _The_
_Phantom_Menace_ was at least entertaining, but none of these guys
were awake enough to carry even a nominal conversation...

    ...but in all it was worth it.  Came right in and hooked up
the system to our projection screen in our conference room.  
Soul Calibur rocks.  Unfortunately due to the shipping mix-up I
won't be getting my extra controller, VMU or NFL2K until this
afternoon.  I'm stoked!

    Work related stuff...  Hmmm...  still can't talk about that
all that much.  Just suffice it to say that this stuff is pretty
damn cool.  Hope to tell you more soon.

    Seeing as I am Project Lead on this next Raven excursion, I
am beginning to take a very keen interest in our PR and how we 
can give fans what they want in a form that they like.  I'm not
all that interested in hype for hype's sake, I'd rather get people
into the mindset of the game, and get them interested.  That's the
only thing I regret with Heretic II, most people didn't really
understand exactly what we were making and what we were trying to
accomplish.

    So, if there's anything you've been dying to learn about
during the development of a game, or if there is some type of 
coverage of another game that you really enjoyed, please drop me 
a line and let me know...  <a href="mailto:plipo@ravensoft.com?subject=Project PR">--(Mail Pat)--</a>

    Together we can stamp out empty-headed game hype!
