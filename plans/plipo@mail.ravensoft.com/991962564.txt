Here I am again.  Various bits, some of which are so late as to
be nearly moot:
========
E3 was really tiring, but a blast!  We had a great response to 
Soldier of Fortune 2 and to Jedi Knight 2.  It really invigorating after all the work of
getting a demo together to talk to people who are really excited
about this thing you've spent so much time with.

However, I also gotta empathize with companies like 3D Realms who
assert that E3 is not only taxing on a team, but it runs the risk 
of showing your hand too early.  I had implemented some great new
technology for foliage into Soldier of Fortune 2, which got some
good attention.  Except, I couldn't believe the number of
developers I saw standing at our booth taking notes, speaking into
tape recorders, and dragging programmers over to check it out.  
I even caught an employee of one not-so-unknown developer who had
somehow gotten control an unattended kiosk and just sat there
carefully scrutinizing the ground...  It was enough to drive a guy
nuts!  So, if every "realistic shooter" released this Christmas
has nice-looking grass blowing in the breeze, just give a nod our
way... :-P
========
The reason I'm only talking about E3 now is that after the show, 
my wife and I rented a convertible and drove Hwy 1 up the coast 
from L.A. to S.F. over several days.  Nice drive, and a good 
followup to last year when we drove from Seattle to S.F.  San 
Luis Obispo was particularly nice, I think Oddworld Inhabitants 
is located there, the lucky dogs. :-)  In all the 10 days of 
vacation was just what I needed, except for the sunburn!
========
We just reached a real milestone with our PS2 project.  Damn it's
looking cool.
========
I'm still waiting to get a chance to downsample and crop the
Cyclones videos I have derived.  I also got some help with the 
video capture rig, so I can start grabbing some of the even-worse
unused scenes that I have on tape.  Hopefully I can get some stuff
that doesn't take 20 minutes each to download on cable...

E3 crunch time...  Such fun!

I finally got my act together and gathered together a shrine to 
one of the pinnacles of cinematic achievements, Cyclones.  This 
game was the first full product I ever worked on, so it holds a
special place in my heart.  

It also sports the worst cinematics ever created by mortal man.

In fact, I'm so certain of this fact that I issue a challenge:  
If anyone can offer up cinematics from another game that is worse
than these, and if it stands up to a vote on the web, I will give 
that person any free game from Activision's published products.  
We just need an impartial website out there to host the vote!

The cinematics on my webpage, right here:

We just moved our webserver today, so if that link doesn't work, 
try the IP:  <a href="http://204.97.248.100/users/plipo">http://204.97.248.100/users/plipo</a>

The only caveat is that the movies are a bit big, I will cut them 
down a tad later this week...
