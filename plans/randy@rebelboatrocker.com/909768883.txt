Rob, Stephen Palmer and myself will be giving a talk at the Frag2 on
Saturday at around 2:30pm.

We'll be discussing the future of level design in first person 3d ganes.
We're bringing some visual materials (screen shots and stuff) to help
present some of the innovations everyone should expect in next generation
engines like RBR1. The purpose of the talk isn't to show off the game,
but to explain and demonstrate the techniques developers are evolving
towards in world creation.

Arbitrary polygons are cool.  Multipass rendering is cool.  Alpha blending
is cool. This should be the first real public glimpse of what future 3d
shooter game terrain meshes will look like.  You'll get to see what life
is like after the limits of brush geometry, 2d editing and csg construction
have gone away.

The talk should be good for game fans who want to know what's coming up
next, for amateur designers to start getting prepared for the next
generation and for developers who like to steal things (that's not a
dig... we all do it to some extent.  Learning from each other makes the
whole industry more powerful.)

Anyway, come on by.  There will be time for Q&A.  And, stick around
later to watch us win the DooM2 All-Star Deathmatch Tourney. : )

Here's the official talk description:

Saturday

2:30 PM  "Level Design for the Next Generation"

                Rebel Boat Rocker
                Rob Heironimus
                Randy Pitchford
                Stephen Palmer

                The level design team from Rebel Boat Rocker will be
                sharing level design techniques and trends for the future
                of game technology.  The discussion will include talk of
                arbitrary polygon construction, curves, multipass lighting,
                shading and bump mapping, population, animation, LOD
                and tesselation, and visibility set generation and will
                compare and contrast with current brush editing
                paradigms.  This discussion will be interactive and
                questions are encouraged.

DooM Wisdom:

In DooM ][ Old Deathmatch set at Skill 5, it is possible to kill a marine
who has 100% health and zero armor with a single shot from the single
barrel shotgun.

I have a demo to proove it.


Other Stuff:

Greg C., if you're reading, e-mail me.  I miss you, man.  I played Out of
This World again the other day and it brought back cool memories.
Remember 'Wachenga, Cahuenga'.  Heh.
