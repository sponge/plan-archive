I know I've already shared this in more detail here, but it came up again
at RBR in our regular impromptu game theory discussions and I feel it's an
axiom that should be burned into the mind of every game designer.

The challenge of a puzzle or skill in a game is the sum of the
difficulty of the skill that's tested and the penalty for failing that
skill test.  This sum is how reward for success over the challenge is
determined.  The general rule is that the difficulty of the test should
be inverserly proportional to the penalty for failure. Also, as the
game progresses, challenge (the sum of skill difficulty and penalty) is
gradually increased.

The 'rules' (there are tons more) are always a pretty solid place to
objectively evaluate what you're doing. But, it's important for us to
not forget that game design is more often than not the opposite of
formulaic.


Oh, and if the moon was made of cheese, would you eat it?  It's a simple
question...Would you eat the moon?

I would.

Happy Birthday to Kerry Wilkinson.


Other stuff:
Since we've got two ex-Microprose kids in the house, we tried out
European Air War last night. Brian was pleasantly surprised to see
some of his art in the game.  Some of the cool maps he did for "Across
The Rhine" about a zillion years ago appear in the mission briefing
screens.

If anyone actually plays EAW, you may think that the Luftwaffe jet planes
can pretty much smoke anything else, but my P-51d ruled the skies when we
tried it out.  Yeah, the jets move like a fish, but they steer like a cow.

Oh, and don't get all twisted thinking I'm a converted sim guy... I went
home last night and played Expert CTF for a couple of hours to recoup :)
But, if you dig sims go get EAW. But if you're like me, you'd rather
spend your time with one of the five new 1st person action games.

Special thanks to the Ion Storm dudes for being great hosts for the
finals of the DooM][ All Star tourney we carried over from The Frag2.

I'll send the details of the results to that Doom2 all star tourney
page on doomnation.com over the weekend.

I think the most fun, though, was playing on Squirrel's deathtag map
after the tourney - even though me and Squirrel got stomped by Natas
and Rob 5-3 (or was it 2?).

Anyway, In case you're wondering how the actual tourney went down, it
played out like this:

1. Mark "Natas" Fletcher [ION]
2. Rob "Psychology" Heironimus [RBR]
3. Randy "DuvalMagic" Pitchford [RBR]
4. Sverre "Sverre" Kvernmo [ION]

I'll make sure the brackets for the whole tourney are posted somewhere.
I had a blast playing and look forward to more competitions like these.
It's been literally two years since I've played deathmatch in a real
competition and all the feelings of nerves and excitement coming back
during the event were awesome.  Sorry if my cockyness rubbed anyone the
wrong way, but it makes games more fun for me to get a little worked up
and talk a little trash. It's all in fun. I completely respected the
skills of everyone in the tourney...Especially Paradox who's insane
warm-up is friggin' cool to watch. I also particularly enjoyed Romero's
match with Blue. Great fun.

I want to give special congrats to my homeboy, Rob, for defeating me in
the double elim. finals allowing him to face the incredible BFG pimping
Natas. Natas really knows how to keep his cool in tournament conditions.
But, Rob truly came out of the booth against me when it counted.  I
didn't give that one to him...he earned it.  I wanted to win!

And finally, Brian "Astro Chimp" Martel and I are going to get
hype on Squirrel's deathtag against our practice partners Rob and
Reichert, so in a couple of weeks you all better beware!

Oh, and don't worry... Dispite all of this DooM action we're still
working 10+ hours a day on making the game :)

Rob, Stephen Palmer and myself will be giving a talk at the Frag2 on
Saturday at around 2:30pm.

We'll be discussing the future of level design in first person 3d ganes.
We're bringing some visual materials (screen shots and stuff) to help
present some of the innovations everyone should expect in next generation
engines like RBR1. The purpose of the talk isn't to show off the game,
but to explain and demonstrate the techniques developers are evolving
towards in world creation.

Arbitrary polygons are cool.  Multipass rendering is cool.  Alpha blending
is cool. This should be the first real public glimpse of what future 3d
shooter game terrain meshes will look like.  You'll get to see what life
is like after the limits of brush geometry, 2d editing and csg construction
have gone away.

The talk should be good for game fans who want to know what's coming up
next, for amateur designers to start getting prepared for the next
generation and for developers who like to steal things (that's not a
dig... we all do it to some extent.  Learning from each other makes the
whole industry more powerful.)

Anyway, come on by.  There will be time for Q&A.  And, stick around
later to watch us win the DooM2 All-Star Deathmatch Tourney. : )

Here's the official talk description:

>>>
Saturday

2:30 PM  "Level Design for the Next Generation"

                Rebel Boat Rocker
                Rob Heironimus
                Randy Pitchford
                Stephen Palmer

                The level design team from Rebel Boat Rocker will be
                sharing level design techniques and trends for the future
                of game technology.  The discussion will include talk of
                arbitrary polygon construction, curves, multipass lighting,
                shading and bump mapping, population, animation, LOD
                and tesselation, and visibility set generation and will
                compare and contrast with current brush editing
                paradigms.  This discussion will be interactive and
                questions are encouraged.

DooM Wisdom:

In DooM ][ Old Deathmatch set at Skill 5, it is possible to kill a marine
who has 100% health and zero armor with a single shot from the single
barrel shotgun.

I have a demo to proove it.


Other Stuff:

Greg C., if you're reading, e-mail me.  I miss you, man.  I played Out of
This World again the other day and it brought back cool memories.
Remember 'Wachenga, Cahuenga'.  Heh.
