DooM Wisdom:

In DooM ][ Old Deathmatch set at Skill 5, it is possible to kill a marine
who has 100% health and zero armor with a single shot from the single
barrel shotgun.

I have a demo to proove it.


Other Stuff:

Greg C., if you're reading, e-mail me.  I miss you, man.  I played Out of
This World again the other day and it brought back cool memories.
Remember 'Wachenga, Cahuenga'.  Heh.
