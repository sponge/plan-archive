It's been 3 months since my last .plan update, so I guess it's about time 
for a new one.  

Sin Info
--------
I've been busy working on interface / 2D things for Sin.  We are now 
finalizing the way the interface is going to work.  I've taken the layout
commands from Quake2 and added about 50 new features.  This will let anyone
create custom interfaces for the game menus and the HUD.

The layout commands are kind of like a primitive form of HTML, so if you can
make a webpage, you probably can create a Sin menu or HUD.  One of the cool
things is that everytime I add a new command for the HUD, it can also
be used on the in-game consoles.  This lets you put things like the 
player's health or name on a 3D screen in the game.

I also had to add some networking stuff to get the multiplayer aspect of 
in-game consoles to work and that took a little bit of time. Most of the time
was spent learning how the Quake2 networking system works and fitting in the
new baselines/states for consoles.  I didn't think that something as simple as
a console in the game would be so tricky, but I ran into many problems
while designing them.  A lesson to be learned about multiplayer game aspects
I guess.

Other Stuff
-----------
I didn't get to go to CGDC this year, but Gary McTaggart took a bunch of pics
for me to re-live the experience.  It just wasn't the same :-(  

Until next time...
