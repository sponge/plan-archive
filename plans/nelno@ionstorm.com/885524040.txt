      s   January        22nd, 1998 3:30am   The new office...  Incredible.  My cube...      Huge.  I'm becoming anxious. VenomVermin... cool.  This thing has an original attack that    I've never seen in any other game.  The attack was John's idea, which is why he's the    man.  I don't think I'd have tried it otherwise, because it wasn't that easy to pull    off.  It was well worth it, though.  Hmm... should I be more specific? ;)     Murphy has been doing an excellent job with the animations. I can't wait to see what other people will do with the    functionality we've got in the Daikatana DLLs.  Originally I had thought to distance    myself from changing the actual engine, but as time goes on I keep adding new    features...  Too bad I can't say what they all are... (must... resist... evil...) The Time Tombs have opened.  The Shrike is.   Hyperion will rise again.
