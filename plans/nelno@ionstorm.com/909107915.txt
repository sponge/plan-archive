Most of the reviews I've seen had positive things to say, but I'd like to make a few corrections, and mention some of the things that Daikatana has that somehow seemed to be omitted from the reviews...</font></p>    <p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>F</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FECC56">irst, everyone seemed very impressed with the look of Daikatana, and I think rightly so, but some misconceptions need to be clarified.  Daikatana is NOT using hi-res textures to achieve its good looks.  The texture sizes we're using in Daikatana are the same as those used in Quake and Quake 2.  The total size of the level textures used in DaBug's E3M3, for instance, map is under 2 Megs.  As for skins, Ken is just a master.  Almost every single skin is 64K (smaller than Quake 2's skins).  The ones that aren't just haven't been gone back over. </font></p>    <p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>O</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FECC56">ne of the most incredible omissions from the current E3 reviews is any mention of our hierachical model system.  Apparently the fact that our characters bend, turn their heads and are visible holding whatever weapon they're using is not a big deal.  When you come up behind someone in deathmatch and they are looking up at a ledge, you can actually see them looking up.  And if they're holding a pistol, you'll see it (and you'll probably kill them).  If they're holding the Daikatana, you'll see that (and they'll probably kill you).  Superfly and Mikiko also use this system, so they have a much wider, human-like range of movements than is possible with Quake's normal frame-based animation system.  There's also no "skating" when a running player fires a weapon.</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>N</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FECC56">o one bothered to mention the amount of content we showed at E3, either, for some reason.  We had 20 monsters in the game.  That's more than most games will have when they're finished.  We also showed 14 weapons -- some of which happen to be quite cool.  Superfly and Mikiko were notably absent, but we decided (for once) not to show something until it's 100%.  Nevermind that my recent promotion to Lead Programmer and the nightmare of converting everything to the Quake 2 engine have given me little time in the last two months to work on AI.</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>D</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FECC56">aikatana delayed again?  Um, no.  As with a few of the other things that were said about our game, this is completely false.  Whether or not we make a September/October release, that's what we're all aiming for now.  Don't believe everything you read, especially on the web.</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>W</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FECC56">hen it comes down to it, what Daikatana didn't do, which most of our competitors did, is have a little room with a running demo (or even a pre-recorded video) where we could sit the press down and walk them through all of the features we have.  So in our case, you're hearing whatever impressions people had when they walked up (which is mostly "it <I>looks</I> awesome") and very little mention of the other things which make Daikatana stand out.</font></p>	<table WIDTH="100%"    BORDER="0" BGCOLOR="#550088"    background="http://www.trailerpark.com/phase1/nelno/plan/header.jpg">      <tr>        <td ALIGN="right" valign="bottom" height="32"><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#FECC56"><b>March        5th, 1998 10:10pm</b></font></td>      </tr>    </table>    <p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Blah.

No names, but it was a <b>unicellular organism</b>. I wonder if <b>I'll</b> get a special    bonus. Yeah, right. ;) <br>    <br>    All joking aside, one of the cool things about having two teams using the same engine is    the code we can share.

When people see it they    aren't going to believe it is done with the Quake engine. Joey's spline camera is just    totally incredible looking (even though I helped a little bit -- ahem). I've never seen    another game with camera movement like Anachronox now has.<br>    <br>    <b>On the Daikatana side of things:</b> the AI is really starting to come along. I'm    getting to the point where I can start coding individual behaviors for certain creature    types. The AI I've got in now is very modular and quite tweakable. It's both dynamic (ie.    the monsters can learn new levels on the fly) and static (what monsters learn about a    level can be saved, modified and restored into the game). Anyone making a Daikatana map    will have the option of pre-tweaking the AI in their level (both for artificial deathmatch    opponents and for monsters).<br>    <br>    The video we showed at the frag was just a taste of what we're working on. Our new skins    artist, Ken, is incredible -- I've absolutely never seen textures in any game anywhere    that match the stuff he's doing.<br>    <br>    I've taken the &quot;sticky&quot; code Noel wrote for DLLs and integrated it into the    Quake engine as a hierachial model system. Basically, you can create one model out of many    separate parts, which automatically follow the parent around, rotate with it, etc. I've    just finished some code for a jointed, track-following turret that uses the system. It's a    bit difficult to describe how it works, but it's rather cool.<br>    <br>    That's all I'm going to say for now... I can't give away all of our secrets...<br>    <br>    </font></p>    <table WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" BGCOLOR="#550088"    background="http://www.trailerpark.com/phase1/nelno/plan/header.jpg">      <tr>        <td ALIGN="right" valign="bottom"><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#FECC56"><b>November        1st, 1997 7:47pm</b></font></td>      </tr>    </table>    <font color="#FECC56"><p>Huh... uh... eh.. bluh.

Well, here it is:<br>    <br>    I've spent the last few months working on anything and everything imaginable, but for the    most part I've been cramming monsters into the DLL code, first for E3, then for our Eidos    milestone, then for ECTS, and now for our second Eidos milestone. <font COLOR="#7F0000"><b>INCOMING:</b></font><font    COLOR="#EFEFEF"> Milestones suck. Deadlines are a good thing, but stuffing content in just    to have content is a waste of everyone's time and talent.</font><font COLOR="#7F0000"><b>END    TRANSMISSION</b></font><br>    <br>    Here are some hints as to what we're doing and what we've got planned: First and foremost,    nothing that is not cool is going to be in our game. When something is not cool, it sucks    it down.<br>    <br>    Our art team has come up with some very, very cool looking monsters for the game. The    operative word is <b>badass</b>. Everything goes through the same process. If it's badass,    it stays, if it's not, it is beaten down until it is a slick pile of worthless data, and    then we kill whoever did it in the first place. Art, code, maps, people... whatever...    that's how it has to be. The models Bryan showed some of us the other day were very, very    badass. They will fit into our game nicely.<br>    <br>    Kee and I have designed a very extensible DLL interface. Daikatana will use multiple DLLs,    and in forseeable cases will automatically register and deal with new DLLs when they are    dropped into a particular directory. What I'm saying is Zeus bots vs. Reaper bots without    mixing any code. Take your Zeus bot DLL and your Reaper bot DLL, put them in the DLLs    directory and watch the Zeus bot die (uhh... wait, I mean, ummm, the Reaper bot, yeah).    New weapons can be added simply by dropping a DLL with the required exported functions    into the DLL directory and having it work. In most cases, functionality can just be    dropped in as a separate DLL, as long as a few standards are maintained. There will also    be lots of tailormade AI functions available to anyone who wants to write their own bot.    Right now DLLs are written in C and C++. We had plans for allowing any compiler capable of    generating a DLL work with Daikatana. However, none of us have the time to try anything    else, so it's possible that languages like Delphi and Visual BASIC won't be able to hack    it. At this point, if you plan to modify Daikatana's DLL code you should expect to have a    firm handle on the C language.<br>    <br>    I've added some cool stuff to the Quake engine in the last week (14 hours was my shortest    day) and I really wish I could tell what it is, but I can't. One is going to be a <b>very    cool and very innovative</b> sword power for the Daikatana. The RPG elements of the game    (ie. your character gaining power in various attributes as the game progresses) are    basically in -- testing will determine what the final caps on each attribute should be.    Noel and I have written a lot of weapons code (about half of our 30 weapons are coded),    and each weapon will get at least one more going over to make it qualify for badass before    it is done. I've also made some changes to the Quake physics engine which will allow a bit    more versatility and realistic interaction of objects. And some minor changes to the sound    code. I've done a lot of work to give our mappers complete control over their entities (I    even went as far as building my first Quake map last week to test out some ideas), but    there is still more that can be done. Suffice to say that entities in general are not as    restrictive as they were in Quake.<br>    <br>    This week marks the beginning of my all-out assualt on creature AI. I've written in some    massive debugging features that will help me add complexity to the AI and sort out any    problems that arise. I've also come up with a few ideas to make things smarter. There will    be both dynamic and static AI in Daikatana. Dynamic meaning you can stick your creatures    on any map and they will find their way around. Static meaning that I have decided to take    some steps towards &quot;cheating&quot; that will make the monsters seems much smarter    than they could be otherwise. Previously I had been leaning toward a good, non-cheating AI    like I strove for with the Zeus bot, that could perform relatively well in any environment    that the end-user could throw at it. However, I've come to believe that I would be selling    the single and deathmatch play Daikatana short by doing that. Monsters will function at    least as well in a standard, bare bones map as any bot available for Quake, but I plan to    give map designers a lot of tools for tweaking the performance of the opponents they place    in their levels.<br>    <br>    </font></td>  </tr></table></div></body></html>
