Njorl's Saga, Chapter 43
========================

The K5000R is turning out to have been a killer investment.  It's already made an appearance in a test track for Duke Nukem Forever, and should continue to pop up now and then in various places.  It has a really great sound that I (obviously) can't say enough about.

If there are any K5000 users out there who read this, head on over to my web site at http://bounce.to/ljackson - I've uploaded a Cakewalk Studioware panel and an instrument definition file to the site.  They're on the Miscellaneous Files section of the site, so grab 'em while they're hot.  I'm using them here in the studio, so I figured I'd share them with other users.

Also, I've set up a mailing list for K5000 and other Kawai synth discussions.  You can subscribe to it from my site, on the Kawai links page.

Finally, the other half of the K5000 order came in today - the MCB10 Macro Controller Box.  It turns out that it is very similar to the Peavey PC 1600x that I already have in the studio.  There are two very important differences, though:  first, it's non-programmable, but the controller numbers it sends can be remapped within Cakewalk if needed.  Second, and most important, it's mine. (evil grin)  The company owns the PC 1600x, but I own the new box.

That has a nice ring to it, to someone like me who's never really owned much of his own equipment.  Ahhhh...feels good.
