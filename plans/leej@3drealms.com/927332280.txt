The Doctor and My Wang

I have just learned, courtesy of a user of the 3D Realms web bulletin board, that Lo Wang's Rap was played on the Dr. Demento Show.  Through a bit of web sleuthing, I managed to track down the playlist on http://php.indiana.edu/~jbmorris/FAQ/drd98.0301.html .  It was played on March 1, 1998, on show #98-09.  No one contacted me to let me know it was on, but who cares - at least he played it!

Now, the focus shifts - with the recent release of the song in MP3 format, I'd appreciate it if you could help get the song on his show again.  I would very much appreciate it if you would contact the good Doctor and request "Lo Wang's Rap" by Lee Jackson and John Galt.  You can do so in any of these three ways:

1. Fill out the form at http://www.clamhead.com/drdrequest.html
2. Call the Dr. Demento request line at (562) ODD-TUNE  (or (562)663-8863 for the alphabetically impared).
3. Post to the newsgroup rec.music.dementia with a subject line of REQUEST and include your name, the city from which you're posting, the radio station on which you listen to The Dr. Demento Show (if none, tell them you listen over the Internet), and the track you'd like to request ("Lo Wang's Rap" by Lee Jackson and John Galt). Remeber, please use a subject line of simply REQUEST (in all capital letters) and nothing else.

You will have the eternal gratitude of myself, John Galt, and Keith Schuler's wife Rose for your help.  Thanks!!!
