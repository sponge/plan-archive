Okay, .plan file update number 247 on Star Wars Episode 1.  My official opinion - I may not want to see this episode again, but I'm ready to see the next one now.  I am not ready to see any more Gungans, though - no more Jar Jar, please.

The only thing I fear is that George (Broussard, not Lucas) is going to want Duke Nukem Forever to rumble with as much bass as TPM did.  Sorry, George, there's no Low Frequency Effects channel on the PC yet.  Talk to Creative Labs if you want one.

Finally, it was good to see the Dopefish in his first screen role, in the underwater scenes.

Swim swim eat Jar Jar.
