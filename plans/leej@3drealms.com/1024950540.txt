It's About Freaking Time!!!

After 19 years, we can finally light this candle...



University of Texas Baseball is back on top where it belongs.  Champions of the College World Series.  Oh, man, that was a good game this past Saturday.  I remember the last two times they won (1975 and 1983).  This time is just as sweet, if not sweeter.

In other news, I finally managed to lay my hands on a copy of Don Sebesky's "Giant Box" album.  This 1973 release would be familiar to anyone who has studied Sebesky's "The Contemporary Arranger/Composer" book.  I've been looking for this thing since I was in high school, and I finally found it by way of a Japanese 24-bit CD remaster.  The disc arrived from Japan today.  Very interesting listening material indeed - now, all I need to do is get the book out again and revisit the examples he drew from this album.


And now, your moment of Blatant Plug Zen:
