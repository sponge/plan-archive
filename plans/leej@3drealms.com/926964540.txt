Blatant Promotion - Ain't It Great?

My web site, the Game Music and Sound Design Center, has wound up as a runner-up of the Top 100 Homepages list kept at World Charts.  The site reference number is 1489, so please go to the World Charts Homepages site and vote!  You can get there from my web page by clicking on the button at the bottom of the front page.

While you're there, vote for Joe Siegler's Black Sabbath Online, too.  He's already on the top 100, so his number should be listed on the voting page.
