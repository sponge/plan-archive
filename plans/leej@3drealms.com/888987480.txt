I've been invited to participate as a panelist at this year's SXSW Interactive conference in Austin, TX.  My panel, which takes place on Monday, March 16th from 11:00am to 12:30am, will cover Music for Games.  Head on over to http://www.sxsw.com for details.

Work update: the past few days have been spent working on converting public-domain samples to Kurzweil-useable format.  If anyone knows of a reliable (and preferably free) converter that turns FastTracker II .XI files into AIFs and keeps the loop info, please e-mail me and let me know.

BTW, please don't suggest Convert 1.4 or AWave.  Convert doesn't always work, and AWave isn't free.  Thanks.
