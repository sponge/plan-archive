3D Realms has been purchased by the Infini-Dim corporation and will incorporate the company's new Unfiltered Perception technology into all of its future releases.  This will make all future 3D Realms games playable across all platforms and all dimensions simultaneously.

Also, every copy of future 3D Realms games will include a complimentary Nowwhatian Bog Hog skin, wrapped in its own towel.  We're not sure what you can use the Bog Hog skin for, but at least the towel should come in handy.
