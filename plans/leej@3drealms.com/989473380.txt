That Would Be A Neat Trick

I am in rather desperate need of assistance here.  I'm trying to move my MIDI setup from an old PII-266 running Windows 95 OSR2 to a slightly more modern PII-450 running Windows ME.  Everything is working fine so far, except for the single most important item in the system: my MIDI patchbay.

The device in question is a Music Quest (Opcode) 8port/SE.  I know that I saw someone somewhere post that they'd been able to keep using their 8port/SE after upgrading to Windows ME, but I can't find the post or any other information on how they did it.  Opcode is useless, of course, since Gibson has apparently abandoned them after buying them out.  None of my searches are turning up anything, and I'm now officially desperate.

Please - if you have been able to get this ancient little gem running under Windows ME (or even Windows 98 Second Edition), please contact me.  I've got to get this thing going again, and I can use all the help I can get.  Thank you.

On a lighter note, thanks to Brian Smith for locating the anime web page.  It's located at http://www.sempai.org/~tonbo/lessons.html if you want to take a look.  The correct quoted sections from the page read like this:

What Tonbo has learned from watching anime.
(Aside from how to speak Japanese like a cartoon character.)

Genre-Specific Lessons: 

Classic Anime:
I really need a giant robot. 

Series-Specific Lessons:

Giant Robo: I really do need a giant robot.
Neon Genesis Evangelion: I really don't need a giant robot!


Brian chose the fully motorized pig as his prize, but sadly it blew a radiator hose and burned itself out the day before he wrote.  We finally finished off the bacon a few days later.  Sorry, but many thanks, Brian!
