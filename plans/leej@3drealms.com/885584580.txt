Well, here's my first post on the company's finger info site.  Nothing earth-shattering, but here it is, nonetheless.

To mirror some of the info I posted on my 3D Portal .plan last night:

1. My web site at http://bounce.to/ljackson has been updated again, this time with the first in a new series of articles called "Real Dealings".  The first article talks about dealing with game producers.  (If you're expecting me to say something in it that may get me fired, you'll be disappointed.)

2. I missed an anniversary last week.  January 15th marked the start of my 3rd year as Music and Sound Director here.  Overall, I will have worked 5 years here come May 5th - that's an eternity in this business. ;-)
