LESSON #14A:  Gear is good.  New gear is better.
================================================

I'd been writing about the Kawai K5000R synth for so long that I just
couldn't stand it anymore.  I did not want to wait until after E3 to add
this gem to my collection, so I bypassed normal procurement procedures (g)
and went out and bought one on my own, for myself.  Got a decent deal on
the K5000R plus an MCB-10 macro control ("knob") box from The Woodwind &
The Brasswind's online shop.  It arrived today, and I'm reveling in the
oh-so-squidgy feeling of having something new to play with.

In case you're interested, this thing is more fun than I thought it would
be when I tried out the K5000S keyboard version a week or two ago.  I have
programmed my Peavey PC 1600x MIDI controller box to mimic most of what
I'll be getting with the MCB-10 knob box, and I've managed use it to get
some of the most lush sounding morphs from one timbre to another that I've
ever heard here in the studio.  The synth has some killer guitar sounds
built in, which I can't wait to start messing with and editing.  It also
has an arpeggiator with a gated chord function - I blew an hour or so
playing with this alone.  I haven't even begun to dig into the real power
of the thing (i.e., serious additive synthesis), but for only having it out
of the box since shortly after noon, I'm satisfied with what I've been able
to do so far.

In short, this synth sounds extremely unique as is, and can sound even more
unique if pushed.  Killer stuff, 3 Michelin(tm) stars quality.  While I
bought it for my own personal use, I'm not about to let it sit at home when
I can use it here at the studio.  It's going to really add to the Duke
Nukem Forever soundtrack, along with anything else I can use it in.
