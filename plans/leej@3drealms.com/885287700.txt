The Game Music and Sound Design Center web site has been updated again - this time with the first in a new series of articles called "Real Dealings". This article is about dealing with game producers, which might prove interesting to some.

On another subject, it would appear that I missed an anniversary last week. January 15th marked the end of my second year and the beginning of my third as Music and Sound Director for Apogee/3D Realms/Pinball Wizards. Overall, I'm just a couple of months shy of 5 years with the company.

Finally, there's a new toy in the studio - a Peavey PC 1600x MIDI controller module. Cool little box - check the hardware list on my web site for a quick review, and hit Peavey's web site for more details.
