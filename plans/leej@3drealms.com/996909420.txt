Now Playing at an MP3.com Near You

I almost completely forgot about this.  A few weeks agok, I submitted another song for my MP3.com page.  I got the usual "please wait for it to be approved" e-mail from them, but that's all.  I never did see anything telling me it was ready, so today I logged on to have a look.  Sure enough, it's there, ready to be played.

First things first.  Here's the link to the page:

The song is the second one on the page.  It's by no means new, nor is it an original work.  It's an arrangement of the Minuetto movement from Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata, Opus 31, Number 3.  The arrangement is for a medium-sized brass ensemble, and it was recorded on April 20, 1989 at a live performance by the San Antonio Brass in San Antonio, TX.  This is a group that Brenda's brother (James) was in at the time (he may still be in it), so I owe a debt of gratitude to him to this day.

I've been meaning to upload it for almost a year now, but I never had the chance.  It's there at last.  Neither the performance nor the recording could be called pristine, but regardless of that, the piece is in fact quite listenable.  I hope you enjoy it.

This work is one of the first pieces I ever had copyrighted.  If anyone is seriously interested in performing it live, drop me a note via my artist page.
