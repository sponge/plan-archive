Once more, with feeling

Man, did I ever speak too soon.  Less than 24 hours after I posted a .plan update to say I was back from having my gallbladder out, I was back in the emergency room and readmitted to the hospital.

It turns out that I had some gallstones "escape" from the gallbladder, along with some other "gravel" (doctor's words, not mine) during the surgery.  These got stuck in my common bile duct and wound up causing pain that was about 3-4 times worse than what sent me to the hospital the first time.  To top things off, I'd picked up an infection and was running a fever when I hit the ER the second time.

Anyway, they readmitted me on Saturday and pumped painkillers, Tagamet, and antibiotics into me intravenously. Sunday they performed an ERCP procedure (stands for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which is a long way of saying "shove a camera down his throat and into his liver" - go to http://www.kfshrc.edu.sa/annals/145/93202.html if you're that desperate to find out about it).  This is not a pleasant procedure to undergo - even though I was asleep during it, the preparatory medicine they gave me before they knocked me out made me feel like I was going to barf out of every available orifice.

After this bit of torture, they kept me one more day.  They released me on Monday, with a prescription for more antibiotics and with more pain pills.

Today, I'm back in the office.  I have no idea what will happen this time, but I hope that it will be nothing like it was last time.  I'm still feeling a bit rough, although this time it's got nothing to do with gut pain.  I'm not sure if I'm over the infection, and one of the scars from the first surgery is refusing to heal.  Nonetheless, I intend on fighting this out until it's over with.  Damnit, I've got music to write and noises to make, and I'm not going to let a smegging organ malfunction get in the way!
