3D Portal is back online, and again, thanks to Brad Wernicke, so is my finger account.  Much appreciated, Brad!

I just got back from vacation this past Monday - nothing exciting, except for a visit to an Austin Ice Bats hockey game. Did a ton of work on the web site (http://bounce.to/ljackson), so go have a look if you haven't been by lately.
