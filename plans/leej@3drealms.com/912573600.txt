Musings on Bodily Fungi

There has been some movement in one of the areas I've been promoting.  Specifically, there's been movement in the Grammy for game music scene.  A group of people from the industry are going to meet with NARAS in a few days to try and hash things out.  The group was selected by a vote of members of the Video Game Musicians' e-mail list (and possibly some others - can't say for sure).  Yours truly will not be going:  while I was on the list of 22 potential discussion group members, I didn't make the final cut.  As far as I'm concerned, I'm happy as long as someone works on making this happen - I'll be happy to cheer from the sidelines.

There's a little bit more on the story to be found  here.
