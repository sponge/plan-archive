Pre-E3 Psychosis Report
=======================

Things have definitely turned strange here at St. Looney-Up-The-Cream-Bun-And-Jam. We have one more day before we haul it for E3, and the place is starting to look like something out of the final exams scene from "Real Genius."

I managed to get out all of the sounds I was asked to do (praise "Bob"). It's not easy trying to balance doing sound design production for two games that are simultaneously in crunch mode. It did work, although I don't think I ever want to go through it again.

Music for E3 kind of got squeezed out by all of the sound effects the two teams requested.  I did get one song done for DNF, and started work on another that I think I'm going to really enjoy working on.

Last item:  if you run into me at E3, don't be surprised if I don't say much.  Improv was never my strong suit, unless puns are involved, and I try not to inflict puns upon strangers.  I'll do the best I can to respond, but please don't expect too much.
