Work progresses on many fronts lately - voices, sounds, music, etc. -
almost satisfyingly well.  Parts of me are still trying to recover from
February's infection, and they tend to cause delays from time to time.  Ah,
but then, aren't antibiotics just so much fun?  My sinuses seem to
think so - they've insisted on a steady diet of them since before
Valentine's day.

Two developments in the new gear story. First, I found the demo of Yamaha's
soon-to-be-released EX5/EX5R/EX7 system. It blew me away - I've never heard
anything with the Yamaha label on it sound like that.  Not to say that I've
never heard anything else sound as good - it was just surprising to hear a
Yamaha unit sound as sinister as the one in the demo did.  The Yamaha EX5R
now joins the others on the potential purchase list.

The second gear development concerns the Kawai K5000R.  I made it by the
Dallas area ultramegahuge-o-mart music store and played around on a K5000S
(same as the rack, but with a keyboard and macro knobs) this weekend.  I
love the sound of this thing.  Very unique, yet ultimately tweakable, and
capable of sinister sounds similar in quality to, yet still different from,
the Yamaha EX5.  Geez, what I wouldn't give for a bigger budget.

Finally, one non-musical studio gear note.  This .plan update is being
typed using a Kinesis keyboard (called "The Essential").  I've wanted one
since I saw it in a catalog about 5 years ago, and have needed one since my
wrists started developing tendonitis last year.  I finally saved up enough
money and bought one this past Friday.  It takes a lot of getting
used to (I still hace proxcvlblems hittihng rthe righrt keys mnow and
th3en), but once you're on it, you're on and blazing away, and quite
comfortably at that.  If you want to see one, head on over to
http://www.kinesis-ergo.com and have a look.

Thus ends this week's blatant plugs.  Enjoy with your favorite beverage.
