I've Got Something for You to Pull, and It Isn't My Finger

Thanks to everyone who sent e-mail about the @Home service.  It sounds like it's a good deal, but I still think I'll wait until the Multiple IP support kicks in.  That is, unless someone wants to donate another machine for me to run as a proxy server.
(evil grin).

The MIDI machine's sound card has been upgraded from an AWE64 Gold to one of the new Sound Blaster Live cards.  It's nice, and I'll post updates as soon as I'm sure Creative Labs won't shoot me for talking about it this soon.

I'm glad that Paul finally broke the silence about Prey using the Toltec Audio Engine.  This is one sweet deal, IMHO.  Again, I'm not going to risk my neck by talking too much about it, but I will say this:  it does what we want it to do.  In fact, Tom
Tucker of Power Micro Research has been working very closely with Tom Pytel and myself on what TAE will do.  It fits Prey like a glove, but it is also so extendable that it would work with almost any other project you threw at it.  Killer stuff.

Cool Tool of the Month - the Evolution Mouse-Track by Itac Systems, Inc., located here in Garland (http://www.mousetrak.com).  Yet another addition to my collection of mutant input devices (a Kinesis Essential keyboard sits next to it), this is the
strangest trackball I've ever seen.  It has 6 programmable buttons and a driver that lets you map keystrokes to key/button combinations.  Not too good for deathmatching by any means, but it's killer for getting real work done.

Oh, and before ChrisDay goes off and tries to interpret this update's title, it refers to a tooth that's giving me trouble.  That, along with some serious sinus problems, is making it hard to stay upright for too long.  Sorry, Chris - go put your mind in
someone else's gutter. (g)
