We'll be back after this break...(snap) OUCH!!!

The hard luck saga continues, this time with a toe as the main character.  I had a bit of fun with the small toe on my left foot and a filing cabinet Thursday morning.  I caught the toe on a corner of the cabinet and heard a snap.  My doctor told me that I broke the toe and managed to dislocate it at the same time.

I'm now wearing what James Storey once referred to as a "none too fashionable boot,"  otherwise known as an protective shoe.  I've
broken toes before, so this is nothing new.  I just hope that it heals faster this time than the one I broke a couple of years ago did.

So, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll take another shot at finding the person with the voodoo doll likeness of me and try to take his pins away....
