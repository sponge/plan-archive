More web site fun - oh, joy! ;-)

I've posted a bit of a surprise on my files page at http://bounce.to/ljackson for those of you who are
browsing this holiday season. If you have the Duke 3D Plutonium Pak
or Atomic Edition, you already have it - otherwise, you might just
want to check it out. It's an .MP3 of the extended version of the
Duke Nukem 3D theme song (Grabbag).

This is a limited time deal: I'm pulling this file off the site on
January 1st. It's also not to be reposted anywhere else, as per the
site disclaimer. However, feel free to play it at home from now until
doomsday, if you so desire. (evil grin)

Since this might be the final .plan update that I post to the 3D
Portal site, I want to take this opportunity to thank Brad for
setting me up with this account. We're going to miss you and the
rest of the crew.
