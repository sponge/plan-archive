Oh, Yes.  I Like This.

After Texas' loss to OU earlier this year, who would have predicted that they'd be in this year's Big XII Championship game?  Man, that OU-OSU game last weekend was something.  I thought I was going to have a coronary when OSU scored the go-ahead touchdown in the 4th quarter.  Whew.  Now, if I could only afford to get tickets to the UT-Colorado rematch....(g)

Interesting link time:

I don't know if I've posted this before or not.  Even if I have, it merits reposting.  Check this site out:

This is a site run by William Milberry, arguably one of the best anime music video creators around.  My first exposure to his work was through his Sailor Mercury video, set to Eiffel65's "Blue."  Turns out that this is just one of several videos he's done to date.  While he has done a few Sailor Moon based videos, that's not all he works with.  In fact, one of his best works centers around "Key the Metal Idol," using NiN's "Closer" for the music (it's strictly for 18+ viewing only, but if you're over 18, it's well worth the download).  At least once a week I'll start off my day by firing up one of his videos, just to get the old creativity moving.  Highly recommended stuff.
