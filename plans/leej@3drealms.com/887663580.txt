I'm back in the office after spending a week dead. At least, that's how it felt - trouble breathing, super-high fever, multiple simultaneous intravenous drips, and at least a week's worth of recovery left to go.  Suffice it to say that the words "rapid progress" aren't going to be used here in this office until the recovery is finished.

As far as what it was, no one seems to have a clue, other than it was bacterial and that it hit everyone in my household (my wife and kid got off relatively easy, thank goodness - I'm the only one who was hit by the sledgehammer). However, since the last person I ran into who had experienced a 103 degree fever (albeit for just 1 day) was Brian Cozzens, I'm blaming him for the epidemic. He denies it, of course. ;-)

Fortunately, only a small mountain's worth of mail accumulated while I was out. Should be easy enough to clear with just a snowblower and a couple of magnesium bombs.
