And Did Those Teeth, in Ancient Times...

Progress report:  busy.  Music and sound, music and sound, research, research, music and sound.  Got a good rhythm going there. ;-)

Health report:  unchanged for now.  Waiting for some paperwork to clear my HMO so that I can start seeing their new gastroenterologist.  Still having pain, but not as debilitating as it has been.

Other stuff:  who the hell has something against my family and me?  Our neighborhood has been nice, quiet, and boringly suburban until recently.  Over the past 10 months, my kid was assaulted by thugs on Halloween, we've have eggs thrown at our house three times, rocks thrown twice (once that broke a window and narrowly missed my wife), and most recently, someone slashed the two right side tires on my truck.  We barely know our next door neighbors, much less anyone else in the neighborhood, and my son doesn't have any kids in the area that we know of who have anything against him.  The Garland Police Department has better things to do, apparently, since they haven't increased patrols or done anything else helpful that we can see.  Not even their "neighborhood officer" has a clue as to what's going on.  At least they've responded when we've called, albeit slowly.  All that we know is that a couple of kids older than my son were involved with several of these events, but no one has managed to get a good look at them.  No one saw the person(s) who slashed my tires.

Summary:  If I made more money, I'd sell my house and move in a heartbeat.  Unfortunately, I can't afford to move, so all I can do for now is maintain a constant low level state of paranoia.

On a lighter note, I've put off the Top Level Domain (TLD) entries for far too long now - sorry, been busy.  I didn't receive entries from many people, but those who did enter sent quite a few.  Here's what I received:
