My web site is about as online as I can get it.  When you get a
minute, head over to http://bounce.to/ljackson or
http://web.nstar.net/~ljackson and have a
look.

I've tried to put some material helpful to aspiring game music/sound
people, but there's also some material relevant to my work at Apogee
and 3D Realms.  Right now, there are a couple of musical outtakes
from Duke Nukem 3D online for downloading.
