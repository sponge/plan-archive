Blatant plug #5402:

If you get a moment, head on over to http://www.clamhead.com/drdrequest.html and put in a request for Lo Wang's Rap. This is the Dr. Demento request page. He's had a copy of Shadow Warrior for a while now, and I've heard nothing about whether or not he plans on playing the rap. I'd really appreciate it if you would provide some polite persuasion. ;-)
