I'm nearing the end of my first vacation in ages, and it's been a pretty
horrible one. Not even halfway through it, I catch a case of acute bronchitis
from my wife. Today marks the first day since the 5th that I've been able to get
out of bed and do anything productive.

Assuming that my lungs clear themselves out this weekend, I'll be back to work
on Monday the 15th. I have a lot of things lined up for when I get back -
preliminary work on Duke Nukem Forever's music and sounds, discussions with the
Prey team, and a million other things that have been put off until I finished my
work on Shadow Warrior and Balls of Steel.

Finally, I'm planning on doing something totally futile. I want to submit Shadow
Warrior to NARAS (the Grammy Awards people - see personal info below) for
nomination consideration. It has a snowball's chance in hell of actually getting
nominated for anything, but I hope to at least make it appear on the ballots.

Why bother to do this? Well, there isn't a Multimedia category in the Grammy
Awards yet. IMHO, there should be. By submitting Shadow Warrior, I'll hopefully
stir things up a bit and get the necessary committees to look into the
situation.

That's all for this go-around.  Watch this space for updates.

(This finger page is a bow to those on IRC who've said I should set one up.)

PERSONAL INFO (for those who care)

As you can see from my credits above, I work for Apogee Software. I began on May
10, 1993, as a Technical Support Representative. I was in the tech room for over
2 1/2 years, but on January 15, 1996, I became Apogee's/3D Realms' first Music
and Sound Director. According to Joe Siegler, I have the privilege of becoming
the first person ever promoted to development from tech support. I'm honored
.

I accepted in mid-1997 into the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences
(NARAS) as a full voting member, based on my work for Duke Atomic and
Stargunner. NARAS is the organization that gives out the Grammy Awards every
year.

My job responsibilities include composing music and designing sounds for
in-house games, as well as for some done by outside development teams. I also
coordinate voice talent and direct voice recording sessions.

George Broussard would tell you that I'm also quite good at spending the
company's money on gear and software. I keep telling him to shop and compare -
he'd soon see that I'm a cheap date.
