A Quick Clarification

Today's news on our web site quotes me as saying, "I didn't make it, probably because virtually no-one on the email list knows who I am."  This is accurate, but I want to make sure that no one mistakes my meaning.

In no way is this a "sour grapes" statement.  As I said in my last plan update, I am more than happy to see the Grammy process continue, whether it includes me or not - as long as it continues.  I made the comment because it is quite likely that no one on the list knows me.

There are two reasons for this.  First is the fact that I am a professional lurker.  I learn from reading, and I prefer not to insert my size 9 1/2 foot into my size 9 mouth.  I don't speak up on newsgroups or mailing lists unless I really have something to say (or something to ask).  This is in contrast to how I behave in person and on IRC, as those who know me will verify.

The second reason is that I've been in this business for a lot shorter time than many of my fellow musicians, meaning I've done fewer titles and had less exposure.  Also on these lines, I have done all of my work for one company (Apogee/3D Realms).  Granted, some of the games were very high profile, but I don't have enough of them under my belt yet.

Whew.  Now, with that said, let's rejoin our original broadcast in progress...
