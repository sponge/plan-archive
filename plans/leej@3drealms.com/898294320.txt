Oh my god!  They killed Dax! (You bastards!)

To anyone who has tried to hit my web site, my apologies:  my ISP's personal web server is down, and the backup crashed.  Once they're back up and I re-upload my site data, I'll be back online.

To those of you going to see the X-Files movie tonight, have fun:  I won't be among you.  I have enough conspiracy, paranoia, and other problems in my life that a series/movie about them has never appealed to me.

To those of you wondering how the switch to the Unreal engine will affect DNF's sound and music, the answer is this:  I don't know yet.  We're exploring numerous alternatives that are now available to us, both for the sound and the music end of things.  Once we get something figured out, we'll most likely announce it somewhere.  Stay tuned.  I think.
