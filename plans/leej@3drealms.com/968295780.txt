Our Long National Nightmare is Now Over

At last, after what seems like ages, I am a man without a country no longer....



The City of Houston at long last has found its replacement for the sorryness that was Bud Adams.  There's a new team in town, thanks to new owner Bob McNair, and its name is the Houston Texans.  The NFL and professional football are back where they belong, and better yet, where they'll be appreciated.

Before you write, no, the City of Houston did not let the Oilers "get away."  They "got rid of" Bud Adams.  IMHO, Bud Adams is a whiner and a sorry excuse for an owner, and if there is any justice in this world, he'll never win the Super Bowl (I've got nothing against the Titans or Nashville - I just can't stand Bud Adams).  The people of Houston realized this, and rather than put up with his garbage any longer, they let him move the Oilers to Nashville and took a chance on getting someone else who would actually work towards building a winning team.  Why else do you think the NFL gave Houston a franchise instead of Los Angeles?  L.A. couldn't guarantee that the people of the city would give a damn about the team.  Houston could.

The Dallas Cowboys vs. the Houston Texans - man, that's got a good sound to it.  I can't wait. ;-)
