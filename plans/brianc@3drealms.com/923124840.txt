Wanted to make a quick update, something other then meaningless dribble (is that possible?)

The interview Andrew Smith did with Matt Sefton and Bill "crash" McClendon is an excellent read and I highly recommend anyone in the games community take a look at it, especially for those old Quake freaks.

I can still remember the popular websites back then. Blues Quake Rag, Quakeholio, Mr.Wolf's Quake Den, Aftershock, Stomped, Threewave, Quakelab and Quake Command.

Anyone remember those names?

Here's a link to the interview, it should be working for now. You'll truly be missing out of an excellent read if you pass it up!
