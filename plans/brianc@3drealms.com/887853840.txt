Its raining outside, damnit.

And to think earlier today was gorgeous, this must be some sort of a compromise!

Anyhoo, update? I myself have been busy working on weapon models and their animation, including their skins. One of which being a rocket launcher, which I'm just now applying the final tweakies. Been doing a little multi-tasking with some texture work. Also been pullin out some concept sketches and all that good stuff.

As far as web graphics, I'm almost finished. Joe is still prodding me every 5 hours for a new graphic. ;)

Mikey is busy workin' on character animation and concepts. He's been comin' up with some very cool stuff! That animation is groovin' along too.

Mr.Johnson, which I have to occasionally slap around is also working on some excellent character animation.. His current target is a chick model. As we all know, unattractive female characters don't exist in games, especially ours. ;)

Was working with Kiwi on utility tweaks, wee! He's been working on a MAX plug-in which should make the character animation process so much easier it hurts. Of course, it would simplify pretty much anything with animation. But the important part is, it drastically decreases the time it takes to bring the model from MAX to our format.

I would follow the .plan trend and talk about 3D cards and their features, but work calls!
