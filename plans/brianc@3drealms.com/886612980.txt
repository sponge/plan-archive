Well, been awhile since I've done a .plan update, so here goes. Hopefully this time it's gonna work.

Just finished up the graphics for our new website, alot cleaner interface then what we originally had. After this, back to texture work!

Also been workin' on weapons, mainly just getting them textured as of late. Using the program Kiwi created for us to skin models with rocks, don't think I could ever go back to the old way. Its made the whole process easier, end result looks better, and keeps me more productive.

Hmmm, think I might be a firearms expert now after all the research I've done on'em. :)

Oh, and everybody take it easy on Ridah with his bot, not his fault. :P

byebye.
