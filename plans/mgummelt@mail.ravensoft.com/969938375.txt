As many people have been asking about Elite Force
source code and tools, here's the status and plans:

We've released so far:

The ICARUS Pack:
All our original, uncompiled ICARUS scripts.
ibize - the script compiler.
BehavEd - the graphical script writing tool 
(it will call the ibize.exe to compile the script you write).  
This tool should be used to view all our scripts 
as in straight text form they will be unreadable.

The GUI Pack:
shaderEd - The tool used to make shader entries.
md3view - The tool we used to view our models.

Next we will release the Radiant Pack:
Q3Radiant (The map editor), the entities def file 
and the textures (some of these are available now I think).

Next, I believe, will be the Holomatch source code for 
the game, client game and menu DLLs.

I will also talk to James about releasing our external 
data files (used for NPCs, weapons, items, objectives, 
animations, animsounds, subtitles, etc.) and a readme.txt 
explaining how to use them.

I will also release the ICARUS manual when I 
finish updating it.

At this time, I do not think we will be releasing 
Single Player source code.  The game was designed 
so that you can modify it significantly through 
scripting, maps and the external data files- without 
having to touch any actual code.

I am going to try to help and support the mod community
as much as I can.  Anyone with questions about modding
can e-mail me at mgummelt@ravensoft.com or ICQ me at
14310759.
