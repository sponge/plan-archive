Ah, Corporate-Sponsored Racism.

I know this isn't the forum for this, but I really have no other
public outlet for my outrage.  I've "disguised" the names of the
companies involved to avoid directly impugning any corporate entity.

I went shopping for a Halloween costume with my wife tonight at 
a Party store here in our City and I was absolutely appalled to 
see a new costume called "Kung Fool" (made by a company that
specializes in halloween Disguise costumes).  Instantly, I felt 
like I was back in grammar school and being called a chink or 
"Hong Kong Fooey".  I recall getting into endless fights 
because other kids assumed I knew Karate because I was Chinese 
(and, of course, I was always the only Asian kid in all the 
different schools I attended as a child).  I always assumed that 
America had grown up some since then, but then there was the 
controversy with the racist t-shirts (made a well-known and popular 
mall and mail-order clothing chain, A&F) earlier this year and I was 
disillusioned of that naive notion.  I was pleased to see, however, 
that Asian-Americans did not take it lying down this time.  I 
always thought that Asians were too small and complacent of a 
minority to really complain about all the seemingly acceptable 
racism directed at them in popular American culture.  I mean, would 
these companies carry the costume if it came with an African-American
stereotype vinyl mask?  After A&F, I was surprised to see that another
company would be so insensitive and stupid as to make and distribute 
such a blatantly obscene costume.  And not just the company who made it,
but every single store that ordered, advertised and now sells the 
costume (the aforementioned Party store here in my own City, a popular 
mall "Gift" store that specializes in novelty items, a store that is 
part of the largest retail chain and largest company in the world and 
several online stores, at the very least).  As I stood there in the 
store, dumbfounded, I wondered how these companies could have 
thought such corporate-sponsored racism would be acceptable.  
I saw an Asian family in the store and saw they had a small child.  
I wondered how he would feel, seeing the costume and I wanted to tear 
the ad off the wall.  I plan on writing to these companies and any 
local stores carrying the costume, and I hope that other organizations 
can get the word out to others as they did so well with the A&F atrocity.
As for anyone else reading this who, like me, is just an average consumer 
who is disguested by this, please consider making your opinion known as well.

Included are some links to and pictures of the costume.
