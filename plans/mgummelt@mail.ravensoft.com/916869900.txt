After getting some feedback about my
finger (someone actually reads this?!),
I thought I'd talk a little more
about the AvP demo and the responses
I've gotten.

One of the responses mentioned that
perhaps the reasons the aliens are
so tough is to make the multiplayer
more balanced (so the players who
are aliens aren't wiped out and
frustrated)

This may be true, but I don't feel
it's a good idea to sacrifice gameplay
in one mode of the game to make it
consistent with the other.  Let the
multiplayer ones be a tougher breed of
aliens and the SP ones be the weaker,
more swarming type aliens.

A common response was that the 
flamethrower actually not that good
against aliens in movie.

Maybe they're right, I don't quite
remember myself.  But I think maybe my
comment arose more out of frustation
of the gameplay.  It doesn't feel
good to give someone a weapon that
is weaker than the one they had,
and generally useless against the
enemies I was fighting.  It might
be realistic, but that doesn't mean
it's fun.  Anyway, if they didn't
give it to you after letting you
use the machine gun & grenade launcher,
I wouldn't have felt so strongly about
it- I want to be excited when I pick
up a new weapon, not disappointed.
Another good idea might have been to
not give us the grenade ammo right
away.

A lot of people liked the fact that
the aliens always showed up in
a different spot.  I didn't notice this
myself, but I think that's more a
testament to how well the demo
pulled me in.  I didn't sit there and
think about how they layed out the
aliens, I just worried about where
they would come out next.

The flamethrower also could use a
better effect- it's kind of... dark...
for flames.  Though I do like how the
flames actually would come off of the
arms and legs and other specific
body parts of the aliens.  Someone also
mentioned that the flamethrower
would hold off the aliens- after playing
again, I did notice that, that's kinda
cool.

Someone also said you could see the alien
inner jaw shoot out to attack you if that
was how they were attacking you, but again,
I never saw it.  Maybe it's because they
move too quickly... a little to hectic.

Anyway, that's the last time I'm going
spend several finger updates talking
about other people's games (at least
until AvP comes out!).  Hopefully
soon the ubersecret project I'm working
on here will be announced and we'll
have a lot to say about it!

More Todd Porter Controversy!

The "KOL" e-mail!

Ok, since this seems to be the scandal
du jour, I'll reveal my secret beef
with the infamous Mr. Todd Porter.

The incident occured back in the
fall of 1997, when I had a brief
correspondence with Mr. Porter
(I'd realized that I was working for
a company that has fairly close
ties to id and former id people.)
Ion Storm was still a relatively
new company and there was a lot
of hoopla about what Romero and 
company were going to do.

I'd found out that one of the founders
of Ion Storm was Todd Porter.  I had
an issue I'd been trying to resolve for
quite some time and all my inquiries
at Origin led to helpful responses, but
no resolution.  So I wrote to Todd
Porter who was involved in the "incident".

I have struggled with the decision to
leak this e-mail but I think it's in
the public interest...

Here is the e-mail I sent him:

Gummelt, Mike
From:	Mike Gummelt [mgummelt@mail.ravensoft.com]
Sent:	Wednesday, October 22, 1997 5:06 PM
To:	tporter@ionstorm.com
Cc:	toddp@ionstorm.com
Subject:	KOL!!!!!!!

Mr. Porter,
   Okay, here it is:  Knights of Legend
is my all-time favorite game.  I had it for
the C64 and not found a better RPG ever.  
But one of my 10 discs got screwed and
I could never finish the game.  I have
designed my own RPG and its definitely
influenced by the sheer level of depth
and detail found in KOL.  I have often
had the urge to play it again, but, as
I said, my discs are screwed.  I also
dont have my C128 in this state (its
somewhere in the New York tristate area).
I did see it once at Electronics Boutique
for $39.99 but it was for the PC and I 
didnt have a PC (or $39.99!)  But now 
Im a "rich" programmer here at Raven 
Software (Hexen 2) and I really want
 it BAD.  BUT Origin wont sell it to me.
They say they dont even have it anymore!!!
So, Mr. Porter, you are my last, best hope.
As producer on KOL (and Lead Designer,
if Im not mistaken)- is there any way you
could somehow arrange for me to get a copy
(Ill BUY it) of the game- preferably the
PC version- especially if the awesome 
manual was included?
   PLEASE GOD SAY IT IS SO!

Begging Pathetically,

Mike Gummelt
Programmer
Hexen 2

And his response:









Yes, that's right, no response.  I even
asked a friend and former co-worker who was
now at Ion Storm to ask him about it.  Again,
no response.  I'm sure Todd had a lot of
other e-mail to read, but he could have
at least answered me!  

Now, some of you may be saying "so what?"
and "yeah, and?" or even "that was one of
the most pathetic, fanboy e-mails I've
ever read and I wouldn't have responded
to it either".  

Well, uh... oh yeah, you're right...

And that's my little addition to the
controversy.

(PS - While the e-mail is, sadly, real- this is
just a joke, please don't flame/sue/maim/kill
or otherwise think impure thoughts about me...)

Aliens vs Predator, continued...

Well I finally played the Marines demo
for Aliens vs. Predator and it was
definitely better, but there were still
a few things that irked me about it.
This time I think I can nail it down to
a few specific problems:

The Design/Game Flow:
I don't know if this game is intended
as a primarily Multiplayer game or
not, but the single player experience
seems a little weak.  Not because of
look or atmosphere- that's all done
very well.  But rather the sense that
I'm totally alone and the aliens tend
to be scattered evenly about with
no real purpose.  They will close in
on me, but it seems like they're just
placed one per corridor or something
like that.  In the films, they came in
droves, not one at a time like henchmen
in an old kung-fu film.  And they
didn't come in a steady stream- there
were long moments of wondering where
the hell they were.  They were also
a little too tough to kill- if they
came in larger numbers, you could make
them easier to mow down.  Of course, I
presume the designers of the game
have them show up in small numbers
because their engine can't smoothly
handle 10 aliens on the screen at a time.
But given the subject of the game, they
should make their engine be able to
do it (if it can't already).  Speaking
of the aliens, their movement seemed
odd as well.  Not their running on
walls and ceilings- that was cool-
but the fact that they'd alternate so
randomly between crawling and running
on 2 legs.  The running on 2 legs looks
weird in general, but the part that
bugged me was that they'd alternate their
mode of movement without any apparent
reason.  Maybe it's because they moved
so fast, I don't know.  And their attacks
felt odd, I didn't know how I ever died,
but I guess that's how it might
feel.  Though seeing an alien inner
jaw shoot into my forehead would be
cool or have my body be taken away
after death might be nice.  Also
being picked up by an alien from
above would be pretty cool.

I still didn't like the head tilting when
you strafe either, seems like it should
tilt in the other direction if at all.

I would have also liked it if I had just
the simple shoulder flashlight they had
in the movies.  Having to use the infrared
visor so much was a little annoying.

This is kind of a pipe dream- but shadows
would really add a lot to the atmosphere...

The flamethrower was kinda lame- in the films
it would fry aliens pretty quickly but in
the game the aliens just run around on fire
and keep attacking you for a while.
But this is probably the toughness of
the aliens issue.

Not having Marine buddies felt wrong also.
I would like to see NPC bots that go around
will me and get nailed.  One marine can't
realistic fight off a horde of aliens<b
