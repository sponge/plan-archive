We'd have to really be either extremely stubborn,
in deep denial, or lying to say that the violence
in our games don't affect people.  I myself had
a kind of a moral crisis when I first started
working in this business, I've always been
against violence, but on the other hand, I
kinda get a kick out of it.  Everything affects
people, even in the most subtle of ways.  But I don't
think it's Doom that's the problem, it's the free
proliferation and general acceptance of violence
in our society that is the problem.  In movies, 
on TV and (to a lesser degree due to limits of 
realism) in games.  That kind of widespread violence
and cruelty in media definitely takes the shock
out of violence and gore.  I think sure, this might
contribute to the problem of violent behavior in
kids, but to a much smaller degree than parents,
our education system, the structure of our society
in general, and the rest of the media.  Doom is not
going to turn a normal kid in to a killer.

What I'd like to see is not desperate, grieving, angry
people and opportunistic politicians looking for an
easy, simple to identify scapegoat, but a comparitive
analysis of all these kids who go on shooting sprees.
See what the similarities are- what kind of family 
are they from, what was their social life like, what 
kinds of areas are they from, what was the quality 
and nature of their education, etc.

I think they key is education, you cannot underestimate
the importance of education.  Good education can make good
parents who will raise better children.  Teach boys and
girls to get along, understand their differences and
be better people.  Teach tolerance and understanding
of different cultures and people.  Teach cooperation,
not competition.  This will help bring equality to
races and sexes and get rid of prejudice.  When the
children get older, they will all get along better and
this will lead to less conflict, posturing, etc. that
leads to violence and war (the situation in Yugoslavia
is a perfect example of this-their negotiations are
more about pride and appearance and macho posturing
than idealism).  When these properly-educated children
grow up and get married, they will get along better 
with their spouses which will lead to a more stable 
family when they have kids.  They will be more likely
to stay together for the right reasons and be better 
parents and raise better children.  This could help 
solve everything from school violence, racial strife,
sexual abuse, nationalism and war.

As a nation, a free democracy with a representative
government it's our duty to make sure our leaders and
politicians know education is important to us.  We
need to educate ourselves first on which candidates are
actually interested in improving education, and keep on
them.  The nature of the majority of politicians is to
do whatever the public wants so they don't lose their
job.  So if we make education important enough to us
and vote appropriately, embrace the politicians who
value education, we can make the difference ourselves,
it's us we should blame for not correcting this problem,
not Doom and black trenchcoats.

Two Years!

Well, today is my two year anniversary of working
at Raven Software!  I have to say it's been a ton
of fun so far.  The people here are great- they're
talented and good to work with.  After 2 years I'm
now working on my 6th project here!  It seems just
like yesterday that I was sitting in the old computer
room with a guy named Tim and some young punk intern
named Josh (who hated being called an intern).  And
that in itself was a pretty big change for someone
who, until a week before showing up for my first
day of work halfway across the country, had never
expected or considered working in the computer
business!

Anyway, pretty damn cool.

I'm just hoping Brian doesn't walk up to me today
and tell me it's all been one big April Fools joke!

     In case you're wondering, I am working on 
the Star Trek: Voyager FPS we're doing here at Raven.

     I'll be mainly responsible for the "new AI 
and Scripting systems so that the NPC's and 
enemies will intelligently react to their 
surroundings and situation" and "team oriented 
combat, as you play the role of a security 
officer fighting alongside your fellow security 
team members" parts of the announcement.

If you missed the announcement, here it is:

     "I am pleased to announce that Raven Software 
will be developing a Star Trek: Voyager game for 
Activision. The title will encompass the attributes
of both intense first-person shooter action and 
team oriented combat, as you play the role of a 
security officer fighting alongside your fellow 
security team members.
     Drawing from the rich Star Trek universe, we
will be focusing our efforts into creating the most
amazing first-person shooter yet, with new and 
intriguing gameplay elements. We are developing 
new AI and Scripting systems so that the NPC's and 
enemies will intelligently react to their surroundings
and situation.
     At this time we are in the early stages of 
development and more information will be forthcoming.

Look for us showing this title at E3 in May!"

Can't say much else right now, just look out for us
at E3!!!

It seems like every Heretic II review starts out
something like this:

	"I'll be honest, I was never a fan of the
Hexen/Heretic series and the idea of a third person 
shooter made me want to barf.  I wasn't expecting 
anything new or interesting from Heretic II and 
I wasn't really looking forward to reviewing it.
	So I left the game sitting under my couch
for three weeks, next to the stale cheetos I dropped
down there last summer .  After all, I was
too busy making human sacrifice to Half-Life and
praying 7 times daily in the direction of Valve.
But, finally, I got around to commiting suicide
like I said I was going to, and I remembered
Heretic II.  I figured it would be a shame to
kill myself without playing Heretic II first-
I mean why waste good money?  So I put the gun
down, took the noose off my neck and installed
Heretic II."

Then, of course, all the reviews go on to
say how wrong they were and how surprised they
were with how great of a game it is, etc.  For
whatever reason, there's a lot of concern that
Heretic II won't be fun because it's either
too much like Tomb Raider (more clumsy exploration
than action) or because third person POV ruins
shooter action.  This is really a misconception
(one I myself had before starting work on the
game), take it from all our reviewers- it's a
lot better of a game than you'd think.  If you've
been hesitant to check out Heretic II, give in and
go get a copy- you'll be pleasantly surprised-
trust me.  Everyone else was, it seems.

BTW, Leet Lives!

<a href="http://www2.ravensoft.com/users/mgummelt/leetlives.htm">Leet Roxor Lives!</a>

PS - A sincere thanks to Thresh for his gushing review:
(<a href="http://www.firingsquad.com/games/heretic2/default.asp">Thresh's Heretic II Review</a>)
It was really cool of him to give the game a real shot
and not be biased by his considerable first person
experience.  I was pleasantly surprised- I especially
liked his remarks about the monsters (maybe because that
was mainly my programming domain in Heretic II)- I would
think he would have wanted every monster to be as smart
as a bot, but he had a very good point about moderation
in AI...

PPS - Just so you don't misunderstand, a little disclaimer:
I wasn't trying to insult Half-Life or Valve, I
bought and enjoyed the game- it had a lot of innovative
ideas and great scripting.  Tomb Raider, too, was a game
I bought when it came out and a lot of people I know
loved it.  They have enjoyed great commercial and critical
success.  And, of course, these are just my opinions,
not Raven's or Activision's.

5:30 PM January 20, 1999

After getting some feedback about my
finger (someone actually reads this?!),
I thought I'd talk a little more
about the AvP demo and the responses
I've gotten.

One of the responses mentioned that
perhaps the reasons the aliens are
so tough is to make the multiplayer
more balanced (so the players who
are aliens aren't wiped out and
frustrated)

This may be true, but I don't feel
it's a good idea to sacrifice gameplay
in one mode of the game to make it
consistent with the other.  Let the
multiplayer ones be a tougher breed of
aliens and the SP ones be the weaker,
more swarming type aliens.

A common response was that the 
flamethrower actually not that good
against aliens in movie.

Maybe they're right, I don't quite
remember myself.  But I think maybe my
comment arose more out of frustation
of the gameplay.  It doesn't feel
good to give someone a weapon that
is weaker than the one they had,
and generally useless against the
enemies I was fighting.  It might
be realistic, but that doesn't mean
it's fun.  Anyway, if they didn't
give it to you after letting you
use the machine gun & grenade launcher,
I wouldn't have felt so strongly about
it- I want to be excited when I pick
up a new weapon, not disappointed.
Another good idea might have been to
not give us the grenade ammo right
away.

A lot of people liked the fact that
the aliens always showed up in
a different spot.  I didn't notice this
myself, but I think that's more a
testament to how well the demo
pulled me in.  I didn't sit there and
think about how they layed out the
aliens, I just worried about where
they would come out next.

The flamethrower also could use a
better effect- it's kind of... dark...
for flames.  Though I do like how the
flames actually would come off of the
arms and legs and other specific
body parts of the aliens.  Someone also
mentioned that the flamethrower
would hold off the aliens- after playing
again, I did notice that, that's kinda
cool.

Someone also said you could see the alien
inner jaw shoot out to attack you if that
was how they were attacking you, but again,
I never saw it.  Maybe it's because they
move too quickly... a little to hectic.

Anyway, that's the last time I'm going
spend several finger updates talking
about other people's games (at least
until AvP comes out!).  Hopefully
soon the ubersecret project I'm working
on here will be announced and we'll
have a lot to say about it!

More Todd Porter Controversy!

The "KOL" e-mail!

Ok, since this seems to be the scandal
du jour, I'll reveal my secret beef
with the infamous Mr. Todd Porter.

The incident occured back in the
fall of 1997, when I had a brief
correspondence with Mr. Porter
(I'd realized that I was working for
a company that has fairly close
ties to id and former id people.)
Ion Storm was still a relatively
new company and there was a lot
of hoopla about what Romero and 
company were going to do.

I'd found out that one of the founders
of Ion Storm was Todd Porter.  I had
an issue I'd been trying to resolve for
quite some time and all my inquiries
at Origin led to helpful responses, but
no resolution.  So I wrote to Todd
Porter who was involved in the "incident".

I have struggled with the decision to
leak this e-mail but I think it's in
the public interest...

Here is the e-mail I sent him:

Gummelt, Mike
From:	Mike Gummelt [mgummelt@mail.ravensoft.com]
Sent:	Wednesday, October 22, 1997 5:06 PM
To:	tporter@ionstorm.com
Cc:	toddp@ionstorm.com
Subject:	KOL!!!!!!!

Mr. Porter,
   Okay, here it is:  Knights of Legend
is my all-time favorite game.  I had it for
the C64 and not found a better RPG ever.  
But one of my 10 discs got screwed and
I could never finish the game.  I have
designed my own RPG and it’s definitely
influenced by the sheer level of depth
and detail found in KOL.  I have often
had the urge to play it again, but, as
I said, my discs are screwed.  I also
don’t have my C128 in this state (it’s
somewhere in the New York tristate area).
I did see it once at Electronics Boutique
for $39.99 but it was for the PC and I 
didn’t have a PC (or $39.99!)  But now 
I’m a "rich" programmer here at Raven 
Software (Hexen 2) and I really want
 it BAD.  BUT Origin won’t sell it to me.
They say they don’t even have it anymore!!!
So, Mr. Porter, you are my last, best hope.
As producer on KOL (and Lead Designer,
if I’m not mistaken)- is there any way you
could somehow arrange for me to get a copy
(I’ll BUY it) of the game- preferably the
PC version- especially if the awesome 
manual was included?
   PLEASE GOD SAY IT IS SO!

Begging Pathetically,

Mike Gummelt
Programmer
Hexen 2

And his response:









Yes, that's right, no response.  I even
asked a friend and former co-worker who was
now at Ion Storm to ask him about it.  Again,
no response.  I'm sure Todd had a lot of
other e-mail to read, but he could have
at least answered me!  

Now, some of you may be saying "so what?"
and "yeah, and?" or even "that was one of
the most pathetic, fanboy e-mails I've
ever read and I wouldn't have responded
to it either".  

Well, uh... oh yeah, you're right...

And that's my little addition to the
controversy.

(PS - While the e-mail is, sadly, real- this is
just a joke, please don't flame/sue/maim/kill
or otherwise think impure thoughts about me...)

Aliens vs Predator, continued...

Well I finally played the Marines demo
for Aliens vs. Predator and it was
definitely better, but there were still
a few things that irked me about it.
This time I think I can nail it down to
a few specific problems:

The Design/Game Flow:
I don't know if this game is intended
as a primarily Multiplayer game or
not, but the single player experience
seems a little weak.  Not because of
look or atmosphere- that's all done
very well.  But rather the sense that
I'm totally alone and the aliens tend
to be scattered evenly about with
no real purpose.  They will close in
on me, but it seems like they're just
placed one per corridor or something
like that.  In the films, they came in
droves, not one at a time like henchmen
in an old kung-fu film.  And they
didn't come in a steady stream- there
were long moments of wondering where
the hell they were.  They were also
a little too tough to kill- if they
came in larger numbers, you could make
them easier to mow down.  Of course, I
presume the designers of the game
have them show up in small numbers
because their engine can't smoothly
handle 10 aliens on the screen at a time.
But given the subject of the game, they
should make their engine be able to
do it (if it can't already).  Speaking
of the aliens, their movement seemed
odd as well.  Not their running on
walls and ceilings- that was cool-
but the fact that they'd alternate so
randomly between crawling and running
on 2 legs.  The running on 2 legs looks
weird in general, but the part that
bugged me was that they'd alternate their
mode of movement without any apparent
reason.  Maybe it's because they moved
so fast, I don't know.  And their attacks
felt odd, I didn't know how I ever died,
but I guess that's how it might
feel.  Though seeing an alien inner
jaw shoot into my forehead would be
cool or have my body be taken away
after death might be nice.  Also
being picked up by an alien from
above would be pretty cool.

I still didn't like the head tilting when
you strafe either, seems like it should
tilt in the other direction if at all.

I would have also liked it if I had just
the simple shoulder flashlight they had
in the movies.  Having to use the infrared
visor so much was a little annoying.

This is kind of a pipe dream- but shadows
would really add a lot to the atmosphere...

The flamethrower was kinda lame- in the films
it would fry aliens pretty quickly but in
the game the aliens just run around on fire
and keep attacking you for a while.
But this is probably the toughness of
the aliens issue.

Not having Marine buddies felt wrong also.
I would like to see NPC bots that go around
will me and get nailed.  One marine can't
realistic fight off a horde of aliens
(though the game could be made that way)
so I'd like to have my marine squad with
me.  At least have a Co-op mode with lots
and lots of aliens.  What was really weird
was I could see on monitors other marines
moving around in areas I had just been,
but they obviously weren't anywhere to
be found.  Just hearing the banter,
screams and radio chatter of your
fellow marines would add so much...

The sound in general needed some help as
far as the marines go- the death and pain
sounded like they were lifted straight 
from the film and cut short.  Otherwise,
the other sound effects (also sounded
lifted) worked well.

The eggs I saw were cool, but I'd like to
see one open and have a facehugger crawl
out of one.  Speaking of facehuggers,
they moved a little to steadily- they should
skitter around more in fits and bursts.
Like spiders almost.  And when they jump
at you, a little more airtime would be
nice so you can shoot them out of the
air.  Same for the aliens.

What I did like:

The infrared view was very nice.  Definitely
captured the feel of the movie.  I especially
liked how areas around lights and explosions
would totally wash out.  The infrared was a
little too handy sometimes, but I liked that
they made it a handicap in brightly lit areas,
and the fact that you couldn't use the motion
sensor when in IR view (though you should still
hear it).  Still, if they'd given me a
flashlight, I would have preferred to use it
in most areas because it would make the
atmosphere of the dark corridors and flashing
lights really more effective.

I liked the base gun.  It had the right sounds
and seemed to be the right strength, generally.
The underslung grenade launcher, however
was mysteriously missing the proper sound
effect.  The explosion of the grenade,
however, had a very nice dynamic light
on it that really lit up the dark areas nicely.

The motion sensor was very very cool-
pretty much perfectly implemented.  It
added a lot to the feel of the game.

The alien deaths were really pretty
cool too- they'd slide along the
ground after dying and thrash about.
Nice.

I liked finding supplies and health
among remains of dead marines-
though finding coccooned marines would
be cool too ("Kill... me...").  I also
liked that if you shot a grenade
at supplied they were gone.


Overall, it was pretty good and one time
genuinely scared the bejeezus out of me.
I'll have to try it again with the Aliens
soundtrack in my CD drive.  Hopefully,
they'll put in more more dramatic game
flow and some of the nice touches I
mentioned here...



When did my finger become a game review
column???

Happy (belated) New Year!

Played some Aliens vs. Predator recently.
I have had an affinity for the Aliens vs.
Predator concept since the first comics
came out from Dark Horse.  I guess being
an aspiring sci-fi filmmaker, it's natural
for me to love the whole idea of Aliens
vs. Predator.  My first mod, in fact,
was Aliens Doom 3: Aliens vs Predator (as
a direct result of playing the Aliens TC
for Doom by Justin Fisher).  Then when I
did Ultimate Quake I had put in Predators
and was working on putting in an Alien (I
had also plundered a lot of other sci-fi
films and franchises).  So when I heard
that there were 2 new Aliens vs. Predator
projects going, one official, one not,
I got pretty excited and I've now had a
chance to try them both out.

I played the first FOX demo version and I
was kind of turned off by it.  Something
about the feel... the control and movement
and weapons for the Predator just seemed
"off".  It's hard to pin down, but the
gameplay just felt "off" and wasn't
very fun.  And I really gave it a shot,
I really WANTED to like the game, but it
just didn't do it for me.  But it is
just a demo and I have high hopes for
the final version.  This is one of
FOX's best game liscences and I hope they
didn't screw it up just because they
wanted to develop and publish it themselves
rather than let a more experienced and
proven developer do it.

Then I played the Aliens vs Predator mod
for Quake II last night.  I tried to run
the v0.99 version I had just downloaded
and it seemed quite broken.  There was no
readme so I figured it might be multiplayer
only and joined Capt_Blood's_MD_Predator
server.  The guy running the server was
kinda a jerk but I guess he was having a
bad day.  Also, he was running v0.98 since
v0.99 was unplayable so everyone was
complaining and that probably contibuted
to his impatience.  I did eventually
get him talking and discussed the game
a little.  To me it seemed a little incomplete
for a 0.98 version, I see a few more 0.99A,
0.99B, etc. versions coming out before
it's fully done.  Apparently there was a lot
of stuff added and redone between 0.98 and
0.99 so I don't know what they've fixed and
added that I felt was missing from 0.98.
Essentially, it felt like an early beta,
the Predator didn't really look or sound like
a predator, and even being the predator
didn't feel quite right (I coudn't jump
very far, and my plasma shot seemed rather
weak and I didn't do well- but I guess if
I'd had a readme to tell me how to cloak
and so on it would have made it easier).
The multiplayer gameplay seemed odd to-
you have 1 predator per 6 marines and
whoever kills the predator becomes the
marine.  It just didn't make sense, especially
with all the marines running around killing
each other and not working together to kill
the predator.  I suggested a mode where the
Marines work together on a team, in a base or
jungle setting.  There is still one predator
per 6 marines.  The marines' objective is to
kill the Predator and the Predator's objective
would be to kill all the marines (6) to win or
get a point.  The Marine TEAM would get a point
for killing the Predator (rewarding working
together).  But when I started to suggest this,
the server admin (who says he's working on the
game also) replied "then they'd be helping
someone else get a frag!"  so I guess he
just didn't grasp the concept of teamplay.

Anyway, I've rambled on, and anyone who's
still reading this must not have anything
much better to do.  In short, I found both
Aliens vs. Predator projects lacking.  I hope
that one or the other really sits back and
tries to make a more immersive, fun, realistic
and dramatically interesting game (though the
mod will most likely be pressured to shut 
down if FOX gets wind of it).  That's the
big problem with games based on movies
is that the developers tend to forget the
appeal of the films is in the character
consistency and the drama.  A game based on
a movie or TV franchise (like Star Trek)
needs to make the player FEEL like he's
in that movie or TV series, not playing
Quake with Predator weapons.  The gameplay
should reflect the dramatic context of the
source material.  More on this in a later,
more revealing finger update.

And that's my rant of the day.
