I'm back from NJ!  I don't have a girlfriend anymore-
I have a fiancee!  Wedding date is July 19, 1998 for
those of you wishing to send money, jewels, riches, etc.
Looking forward to spending the rest of my life with
Mrs. Lynn Gummelt!

Anyway, back to work here.  I had expected the patch
to be out before I got back so I'd done all my fixes 
before i left for NJ.  But since they've decided to 
release the patch and tools and wads, hcode, etc all
at the same time, i've had a chance to attack a few
other annoying bugs.  Things proceed well.  I THINK
it MAY be out Friday(?)

The add-on pack (which I hope gets started soon) MAY
have a 5th character class, 5 new monsters, a 5th weapon
for each class, a 3rd special ability and (I think)
one or two more hubs?  I'd like the 5th class to be
a Warrior Princess with a Chakram!  And maybe one of
the new hubs can be Medieval Japan or Feudal China?
Any ideas?

Well, I'll be away from the 12th to the 20th, so if I
don't respond to e-mail, don't think I'm some sort of
snob or something.  I'll be sure to catch up on anything
once I get back.  But until then, hexen 2 will be the
furthest thing from my mind!  See you in about a week!

Well, workin' a little late here, browsing the web pages,
trying to help out a bit.  We're working on a patch that
will fix some small things and (I think?) address some more
GL issues.  We'd like to have it out by Friday so you can
buy the game, then go home and D/L the patch!  That would
be cool.  It's small stuff so if you don't have it you
probably won't notice the difference that much, but, hey,
why not.

As for me, I'll be hitting New Jersey the same time Hexen 2
hits the shelves!  I'm heading back there for a week to
visit everone and propose to my girlfriend of 8 1/2 years.
We get married June 19, 1998.  I'm looking forward to seeing
her again, haven't seen her since April 3rd!

Hmm... well, that's about it, just boring you with my
personal life!

PS- Yes, the rumors ARE true- I DID shut out Josh Weier
6-0 in the second set of our Tennis match this past Sunday.
Watch out Pat Rafter!  I'm comin' for YOU! (ok, maybe
I'm getting a little carried away- Josh will have to
get a finger to defend himself- he certainly can't
defend himself on the court!!!)

Okay, no more Apogee stuff here. Last thing I want to
do is start a finger war!  Anyway, Scott Miller and
George Broussard e-mailed me, explained that they
didn't mean anything against Raven, etc. everyone's
very civil, no big deal.  Let's not get carried away!

Kaboom 3D?!

Okay, well, now everyone knows, the game is GOLD and
scheduled to hit shelves Sept. 12 (man, that's fast!!!)
I'm really excited about the game, I can't wait
for it to get out there and get the feedback on
something we've all worked so hard to make cool.
And, to help clear this up, when i talk about a
patch, it's not to "fix" the version that's shipping,
but to maybe add a few little extras to an already
great game.  The game, as shipped, is fine and
complete.  When I speak of patches, I speak only
of cool new stuff that we think is nice to put
in or, (heaven forbid!) to fix some unforseen
bug!  We've done as much testing here and at id and
Activision as we could to ensure that the game will
run smoothly, but bugs are resilient creatures and
you never know when they're going to pop up.  You
know, sometimes they just make that "crunch" sound
and when you lift your foot, they just scurry away!

Well, the game is done.  At least, I'm done!  I'm
sure we'll be working on updates after this and
patches (if neccessary), but we're pretty much finis!
Expect it to hit stores on time!

We put a lot of work into making the game perfectly
playable on a 16MB machine, and I'm surprised at how
good we did!  None of it required taking ANYTHING
out, just some reshuffling and optimizing.  We've
all done a great job here, working long, hard hours
(I finally went home last night after not being home
since Friday night- stayed up for 42 hours straight-
programming!).  We have a lot to be proud of.

At this point I'm VERY happy with the game- it's 
everything we wanted it to be and a LOT more.  There
are so many cool things and great details that you
will all be impressed ten times as much as you were
by the demo.  Honestly, the demo doesn't do justice
to the rest of the game.  Obviously, we can't please
everyone and no game is perfect, but I for one
am confident people will like it.  All I know is
if I bought this game- I'd definitely feel I got my
money's worth!

I'm also convinced the game will have a very healthy
afterlife since the Multiplayer game is soooo much fun
and the game is really PACKED with all sorts of cool
stuff that you Converters/Expanders (Like myself-
back in my Aliens Doom/Ultimate Quake days) will
just cream over!  And seeing as how Quake 2 and all
others after it won't be using QuakeC anymore, this
is the last game (seems to me, anyway) that will be
easily modifiable by your average guy without any C
Programming background (again, like myself).

Long Live Hexen 2!!!

Now I have to go and record some demos...

Enjoy!

August Somethin or other, Sunday night- 1 something AM

OW.  Played tennis today and had an unfortunate altercation
with the net.  But I suppose I'll survive... long enough
to finish Hexen 2 at least.

Yes, all you good sports out there, we are workin' our
butts off to get that game to you- we're working 12 hours
(at least) every day playtesting and programming and
bug-hunting- even on Sundays!!!  So it will get to you on
time and it WILL be worth the wait!

NOW, as per the matter of John Carmack's birthday- no-one
has responded!  I know people read these- I remember the
modem incident (over 300 e-mails in 4 hours!).  SOMEONE
must know!

Well, here's what I've been up to:

MY MONSTERS:
Mezzomen were done a while ago- they're really cool and
will scare the heck out of people- vicious.

Medusa's almost there- still some tweaking, but her
gaze is deadly!  Don't look at her too long...

Imps are done, and man are they cool.  They swoop and
dive and claw and head-butt and dodge... people will
find them challenging for certain.

Spiders are finally done too.  They're fast and jittery
and really creepy.  And you'll find them in some surprising
places...

Eidolon is coming along nicely, a great boss with some
nice surprises- his level is pretty cinematic, it's not
as simple as it seems... but I shan't say more...

Pestilence is my latest work.  He's cool, has some
interesting attacks and a nice level.  And he does one
thing that's pretty darn scary.

WEAPONS:
Assassin's crossbow, grenades and scarab staff are all
done and working well.  one of the favorites here is the
Scarab Staff which is nice since I was worried about it at
first.

Crusader's hammer is cool- he's the only one that can throw
his melee weapon when powered up- nice advantage.  His
ice staff is working well now too, and the power up is finally
feeling right.  The freezing effect is really cool.  The
Meteor Staff is really cool and was the first weapon of
mine to really come together nicely.  it has a great feel
and a cool power-up.  And the Sunstaff is really cool too,
deadly in tight spaces!

Necromancer's spells are cool- magic missiles have a nice
visual and the bone shards are just nasty!!!  And I must
say Kudos to Brian Shubat on the Necromancer's hands- they
are AWESOME!  You WILL cream.

Anyway, there's a lot of other cool stuff in there we've been
working on, I tried to make the Invincibilies at least be visually
unique, the glyphs for each character worked out very well,
I'm proud of those- the Summon Monster is cool too...

Well, I don't want to give too much away, just want to tempt
you enough so you start saving up your lunch money- it's coming
soon!  Real soon!

=============================================================

Sorry, Ken, I meant it's the best game ever to
come out of Raven Software UNTIL TNP comes out!

Don't hurt me!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME
I BELONG IN THE ZOO
WITH THE MONKEYS AND THE ELEPHANTS
AND THAT JOHN CARMACK TOO!

Hey all, Yes, that's right, today is my birthday,
I'm the big 26!  I told myself that I'd be rich
and famous and have made my first feature film
by now!  Oh well, there's always 27...  But 
seriously folks, I'm having a great time here at
Raven, Hexen 2 looks and plays great, I think it
will be the best game to come out of Raven
Software (except Black Crypt, of course!).  The
weapons are all looking and feeling good, I love
the classes and their differences, the artifacts
add a whole lot of dimension to the game (especially
in DM!  I've never played such fun DM!)  And the
monsters are very very cool.  After looking at
them day after day for 5 months, I forget how cool
they are- when people see our monsters, I think
they'll be thoroughly impressed- our quality
of animation, skins, and AI (patting self on back)
will surpass any game that has come before- our
art dept did a really good job.  It will definitely
raise the ante for the next wave of games as far
as good-looking and interesting monsters go.  And
wait until you see Eidolon!  By the way, I heard
a screenshot of Eidolon got leaked out, and that
really ticks me off.  If anyone has it, please do
us a favor here and don't pass it around- don't
ruin the game for other people!  And that's about
all I have to say about that.

Oh, and about the John Carmack thing up there,
I've heard an unconfirmed rumor that he was born
on the same day as me!  Can any one confirm or
conflict this?

BOOBERRY RULES!
