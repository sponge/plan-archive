Well, it's been a long time since I've updated my .plan file, but
I have a good reason.  I just downloaded and played the "Colosseum"
mod (by Jake Keating) for Jedi Knight II and, I have to say, it kicks
ASS!  This is the best, most polished mod I've ever seen for one of 
our games!

I am thoroughly impressed!  The mod shows not only an impressive 
understanding of multiple and diverse systems in the game (the UI, 
the sabers, scripting, in-game cinematics, pre-rendered cinematics, 
music, mapping, modelling, texturing, effects, sounds, etc., etc.) 
but also a real "director's eye" for creating a compelling story 
within the context of exciting and fun gameplay... not to mention 
presenting the entire package in a slick, professional style!  
And I love the educational aspect of it, too!  

If you have JK2, I highly recommend downloading this mod and checking
it out.  You can find it on the Jedi Knight II community sites, or
just download it with this link from jk2files.com:

Also, Jake Keating's website is: http://www.jakekeating.com

I hope Jake continues to mod (or get a job in "the biz") because he 
really seems to have an obvious talent for making games!
