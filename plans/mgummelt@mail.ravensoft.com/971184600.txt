About Elite Force load times:

Our guy here who implemented the load/save system and
optimized it says that all load times on his machine
are between 10 and 30 seconds.  In fact, Activision had
a strict time limit on the load times- we'd be told to
fix the level/load code if any level took longer than 
a certain amount of time to load (not sure what it was, 
but it was nowhere near what some people are reporting).

Overall, I haven't heard much about load times, but
a few people on our messageboard and even a couple
reviewers claim that their loading times have been
long.  Sometimes, I suppose, this could be due to having
a fragmented hard drive or other problems, but 
overwhelmingly, these long load times are due lack of RAM
causing the hard drive to thrash while loading.  A friend of
mine had this problem and we tried a few things to fix
it.  In the end, the problem was he simply didn't have
enough system/video RAM to run the game at the resolution
and detail level he was trying to.  If you want to run
the game at 1024x768 in 32 bit color with all the detail
settings at "very high" with high quality sound- you
better have at least 128MB of system RAM and 64MB RAM
on your video card.  Even then, EF by default allocates
56MB of RAM to loading the map, sounds, models, etc.

Short answer:  If you're having long loading times, you're
pushing your system too hard- drop your resolution/detail
settings.

As many people have been asking about Elite Force
source code and tools, here's the status and plans:

We've released so far:

The ICARUS Pack:
All our original, uncompiled ICARUS scripts.
ibize - the script compiler.
BehavEd - the graphical script writing tool 
(it will call the ibize.exe to compile the script you write).  
This tool should be used to view all our scripts 
as in straight text form they will be unreadable.

The GUI Pack:
shaderEd - The tool used to make shader entries.
md3view - The tool we used to view our models.

Next we will release the Radiant Pack:
Q3Radiant (The map editor), the entities def file 
and the textures (some of these are available now I think).

Next, I believe, will be the Holomatch source code for 
the game, client game and menu DLLs.

I will also talk to James about releasing our external 
data files (used for NPCs, weapons, items, objectives, 
animations, animsounds, subtitles, etc.) and a readme.txt 
explaining how to use them.

I will also release the ICARUS manual when I 
finish updating it.

At this time, I do not think we will be releasing 
Single Player source code.  The game was designed 
so that you can modify it significantly through 
scripting, maps and the external data files- without 
having to touch any actual code.

I am going to try to help and support the mod community
as much as I can.  Anyone with questions about modding
can e-mail me at mgummelt@ravensoft.com or ICQ me at
14310759.
