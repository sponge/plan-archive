Aliens vs Predator, continued...

Well I finally played the Marines demo
for Aliens vs. Predator and it was
definitely better, but there were still
a few things that irked me about it.
This time I think I can nail it down to
a few specific problems:

The Design/Game Flow:
I don't know if this game is intended
as a primarily Multiplayer game or
not, but the single player experience
seems a little weak.  Not because of
look or atmosphere- that's all done
very well.  But rather the sense that
I'm totally alone and the aliens tend
to be scattered evenly about with
no real purpose.  They will close in
on me, but it seems like they're just
placed one per corridor or something
like that.  In the films, they came in
droves, not one at a time like henchmen
in an old kung-fu film.  And they
didn't come in a steady stream- there
were long moments of wondering where
the hell they were.  They were also
a little too tough to kill- if they
came in larger numbers, you could make
them easier to mow down.  Of course, I
presume the designers of the game
have them show up in small numbers
because their engine can't smoothly
handle 10 aliens on the screen at a time.
But given the subject of the game, they
should make their engine be able to
do it (if it can't already).  Speaking
of the aliens, their movement seemed
odd as well.  Not their running on
walls and ceilings- that was cool-
but the fact that they'd alternate so
randomly between crawling and running
on 2 legs.  The running on 2 legs looks
weird in general, but the part that
bugged me was that they'd alternate their
mode of movement without any apparent
reason.  Maybe it's because they moved
so fast, I don't know.  And their attacks
felt odd, I didn't know how I ever died,
but I guess that's how it might
feel.  Though seeing an alien inner
jaw shoot into my forehead would be
cool or have my body be taken away
after death might be nice.  Also
being picked up by an alien from
above would be pretty cool.

I still didn't like the head tilting when
you strafe either, seems like it should
tilt in the other direction if at all.

I would have also liked it if I had just
the simple shoulder flashlight they had
in the movies.  Having to use the infrared
visor so much was a little annoying.

This is kind of a pipe dream- but shadows
would really add a lot to the atmosphere...

The flamethrower was kinda lame- in the films
it would fry aliens pretty quickly but in
the game the aliens just run around on fire
and keep attacking you for a while.
But this is probably the toughness of
the aliens issue.

Not having Marine buddies felt wrong also.
I would like to see NPC bots that go around
will me and get nailed.  One marine can't
realistic fight off a horde of aliens
(though the game could be made that way)
so I'd like to have my marine squad with
me.  At least have a Co-op mode with lots
and lots of aliens.  What was really weird
was I could see on monitors other marines
moving around in areas I had just been,
but they obviously weren't anywhere to
be found.  Just hearing the banter,
screams and radio chatter of your
fellow marines would add so much...

The sound in general needed some help as
far as the marines go- the death and pain
sounded like they were lifted straight 
from the film and cut short.  Otherwise,
the other sound effects (also sounded
lifted) worked well.

The eggs I saw were cool, but I'd like to
see one open and have a facehugger crawl
out of one.  Speaking of facehuggers,
they moved a little to steadily- they should
skitter around more in fits and bursts.
Like spiders almost.  And when they jump
at you, a little more airtime would be
nice so you can shoot them out of the
air.  Same for the aliens.

What I did like:

The infrared view was very nice.  Definitely
captured the feel of the movie.  I especially
liked how areas around lights and explosions
would totally wash out.  The infrared was a
little too handy sometimes, but I liked that
they made it a handicap in brightly lit areas,
and the fact that you couldn't use the motion
sensor when in IR view (though you should still
hear it).  Still, if they'd given me a
flashlight, I would have preferred to use it
in most areas because it would make the
atmosphere of the dark corridors and flashing
lights really more effective.

I liked the base gun.  It had the right sounds
and seemed to be the right strength, generally.
The underslung grenade launcher, however
was mysteriously missing the proper sound
effect.  The explosion of the grenade,
however, had a very nice dynamic light
on it that really lit up the dark areas nicely.

The motion sensor was very very cool-
pretty much perfectly implemented.  It
added a lot to the feel of the game.

The alien deaths were really pretty
cool too- they'd slide along the
ground after dying and thrash about.
Nice.

I liked finding supplies and health
among remains of dead marines-
though finding coccooned marines would
be cool too ("Kill... me...").  I also
liked that if you shot a grenade
at supplied they were gone.


Overall, it was pretty good and one time
genuinely scared the bejeezus out of me.
I'll have to try it again with the Aliens
soundtrack in my CD drive.  Hopefully,
they'll put in more more dramatic game
flow and some of the nice touches I
mentioned here...



When did my finger become a game review

Happy (belated) New Year!

Played some Aliens vs. Predator recently.
I have had an affinity for the Aliens vs.
Predator concept since the first comics
came out from Dark Horse.  I guess being
an aspiring sci-fi filmmaker, it's natural
for me to love the whole idea of Aliens
vs. Predator.  My first mod, in fact,
was Aliens Doom 3: Aliens vs Predator (as
a direct result of playing the Aliens TC
for Doom by Justin Fisher).  Then when I
did Ultimate Quake I had put in Predators
and was working on putting in an Alien (I
had also plundered a lot of other sci-fi
films and franchises).  So when I heard
that there were 2 new Aliens vs. Predator
projects going, one official, one not,
I got pretty excited and I've now had a
chance to try them both out.

I played the first FOX demo version and I
was kind of turned off by it.  Something
about the feel... the control and movement
and weapons for the Predator just seemed
"off".  It's hard to pin down, but the
gameplay just felt "off" and wasn't
very fun.  And I really gave it a shot,
I really WANTED to like the game, but it
just didn't do it for me.  But it is
just a demo and I have high hopes for
the final version.  This is one of
FOX's best game liscences and I hope they
didn't screw it up just because they
wanted to develop and publish it themselves
rather than let a more experienced and
proven developer do it.

Then I played the Aliens vs Predator mod
for Quake II last night.  I tried to run
the v0.99 version I had just downloaded
and it seemed quite broken.  There was no
readme so I figured it might be multiplayer
only and joined Capt_Blood's_MD_Predator
server.  The guy running the server was
kinda a jerk but I guess he was having a
bad day.  Also, he was running v0.98 since
v0.99 was unplayable so everyone was
complaining and that probably contibuted
to his impatience.  I did eventually
get him talking and discussed the game
a little.  To me it seemed a little incomplete
for a 0.98 version, I see a few more 0.99A,
0.99B, etc. versions coming out before
it's fully done.  Apparently there was a lot
of stuff added and redone between 0.98 and
0.99 so I don't know what they've fixed and
added that I felt was missing from 0.98.
Essentially, it felt like an early beta,
the Predator didn't really look or sound like
a predator, and even being the predator
didn't feel quite right (I coudn't jump
very far, and my plasma shot seemed rather
weak and I didn't do well- but I guess if
I'd had a readme to tell me how to cloak
and so on it would have made it easier).
The multiplayer gameplay seemed odd to-
you have 1 predator per 6 marines and
whoever kills the predator becomes the
marine.  It just didn't make sense, especially
with all the marines running around killing
each other and not working together to kill
the predator.  I suggested a mode where the
Marines work together on a team, in a base or
jungle setting.  There is still one predator
per 6 marines.  The marines' objective is to
kill the Predator and the Predator's objective
would be to kill all the marines (6) to win or
get a point.  The Marine TEAM would get a point
for killing the Predator (rewarding working
together).  But when I started to suggest this,
the server admin (who says he's working on the
game also) replied "then they'd be helping
someone else get a frag!"  so I guess he
just didn't grasp the concept of teamplay.

Anyway, I've rambled on, and anyone who's
still reading this must not have anything
much better to do.  In short, I found both
Aliens vs. Predator projects lacking.  I hope
that one or the other really sits back and
tries to make a more immersive, fun, realistic
and dramatically interesting game (though the
mod will most likely be pressured to shut 
down if FOX gets wind of it).  That's the
big problem with games based on movies
is that the developers tend to forget the
appeal of the films is in the character
consistency and the drama.  A game based on
a movie or TV franchise (like Star Trek)
needs to make the player FEEL like he's
in that movie or TV series, not playing
Quake with Predator weapons.  The gameplay
should reflect the dramatic context of the
source material.  More on this in a later,
more revealing finger update.

And that's my rant of the day.
