We'd have to really be either extremely stubborn,
in deep denial, or lying to say that the violence
in our games don't affect people.  I myself had
a kind of a moral crisis when I first started
working in this business, I've always been
against violence, but on the other hand, I
kinda get a kick out of it.  Everything affects
people, even in the most subtle of ways.  But I don't
think it's Doom that's the problem, it's the free
proliferation and general acceptance of violence
in our society that is the problem.  In movies, 
on TV and (to a lesser degree due to limits of 
realism) in games.  That kind of widespread violence
and cruelty in media definitely takes the shock
out of violence and gore.  I think sure, this might
contribute to the problem of violent behavior in
kids, but to a much smaller degree than parents,
our education system, the structure of our society
in general, and the rest of the media.  Doom is not
going to turn a normal kid in to a killer.

What I'd like to see is not desperate, grieving, angry
people and opportunistic politicians looking for an
easy, simple to identify scapegoat, but a comparitive
analysis of all these kids who go on shooting sprees.
See what the similarities are- what kind of family 
are they from, what was their social life like, what 
kinds of areas are they from, what was the quality 
and nature of their education, etc.

I think they key is education, you cannot underestimate
the importance of education.  Good education can make good
parents who will raise better children.  Teach boys and
girls to get along, understand their differences and
be better people.  Teach tolerance and understanding
of different cultures and people.  Teach cooperation,
not competition.  This will help bring equality to
races and sexes and get rid of prejudice.  When the
children get older, they will all get along better and
this will lead to less conflict, posturing, etc. that
leads to violence and war (the situation in Yugoslavia
is a perfect example of this-their negotiations are
more about pride and appearance and macho posturing
than idealism).  When these properly-educated children
grow up and get married, they will get along better 
with their spouses which will lead to a more stable 
family when they have kids.  They will be more likely
to stay together for the right reasons and be better 
parents and raise better children.  This could help 
solve everything from school violence, racial strife,
sexual abuse, nationalism and war.

As a nation, a free democracy with a representative
government it's our duty to make sure our leaders and
politicians know education is important to us.  We
need to educate ourselves first on which candidates are
actually interested in improving education, and keep on
them.  The nature of the majority of politicians is to
do whatever the public wants so they don't lose their
job.  So if we make education important enough to us
and vote appropriately, embrace the politicians who
value education, we can make the difference ourselves,
it's us we should blame for not correcting this problem,
not Doom and black trenchcoats.
