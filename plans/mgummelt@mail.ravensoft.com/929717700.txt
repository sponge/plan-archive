In a temporary respite from Voyager News,
this from Phoebus here at Raven:

"We're releasing the public beta of the 
long-awaited HexenWorld CTF mod today!
Here's a sneak peek at the online readme: 
http://www.hexenworld.com/hwctf/hwctfdoc.shtml

The mod is a top-notch accomplishment, and
I'm especially glad to have lead this project!  :-)"

On a related note, Chris' finger mentioned
the possibility of doing a "Siege"-type
multiplayer mode for Star Trek, meaning that
we would do something like the Siege mod
we released for HexenWorld over a year ago
(that I have yet to see anyone else try to
make).  The basic idea is that you have
different player classes with different
weapons, strengths, speeds, abilities and
spells.  There and two teams with two vastly
different objectives, attackers who must breach
the defenses of the fortress and get through
progressive objectives- like crossing a moat
that's full of pirahna, using catapults,
digging tunnels, etc; and defenders- who's
job it is to watch all possible entrances and
weaknesses of the fortress and keep the attackers
out of the throne room, including using ballistas,
imprisoning attackers, sealing off areas,
releasing were-jaguars, hiding or protecting
the key to the throne room, using a secret
weapon, defending the spiral staircase in the
center tower, etc, etc, etc.  

Obviously, these concepts would be translated
into Star-Trekky terms.  We could do some cool
stuff since the HoloMatch allows us to create
any setting and maintain believability within
the setting of the show.

Any comments?

I've seen a few interviews and previews of our
game Star Trek: Voyager on the net and some of
them have a few things wrong, so maybe we should
be talking about this game more than we have been.

Here's the general concept of the game:

Since Voyager is pretty much alone, with no chance
of getting any re-enforcements (aside from the stray
interstellar hitchhiker or two they've picked up),
Tuvok has decided to personally train some specialists
to hand the assignments that have the potential to be
the most dangerous encounters and hazardous of conditions.

You play a member of the Hazard Team, an "elite force"
of security personnel each cross-trained with specific
skills.  There's:
Lt(jg) Les Foster - the team leader.
Ensign Alexander Munro - the scout and second in command of the Hazard Team(you).
Ensign Telsia - the Orion female sniper/scout (your love interest).
Crewman Rick Beissman - the heavy weapons specialist.
Crewman Austin Chang - the demolitionist.
Crewman Sitar - the female Vulcan medic.
Crewman Chell - the Bolian technician.
Plus plenty of "redshirts".  As the game progresses,
your character becomes more and more important in both
duties and in the plot.

While you don't actually play any of the main characters,
you will interact constantly with the main characters of
the TV show in a series of in-game cinematics and even
on a couple of the missions.  The plan is to have the
actors from the show do provide the voices for their
characters.

The idea for the gameplay now is to have the missions
have a variety of gameplay styles, some pure action,
some more focused on teamwork, some stealth, and a couple
you're pretty much on your own.  Each mission will be
a few levels and between each mission there are the main
cinematic events on Voyager where you see the progression of
the story and your character's development in respect to
his importance and his relationship with the other team
members and crew.  There are also in-game cinematic moments
in the game at key points of gameplay.

The game has a strong plot and well-developed, well-defined
characters, both from the show and newly introduced in our
game.  At the same time, the gameplay is exciting, fun, and
innovative.  I honestly think people are going to have fun watching
the story unfold as well as going through the missions and
blowing stuff up!
