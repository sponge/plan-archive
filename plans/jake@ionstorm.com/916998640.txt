Tonight will be night number 6 of sleeping here at the Storm. Haven't done that in a loooong time. I did however get to change my underwear from time to time... But alas... that Bisque just wants to be set free. And I have laboured to produce... the first... soon to be public Anox Teaser avi/Mpeg. Got lots of help from the team on this one. Except Lee Perry. He knows why. Stan Neuvo, our sound guy went Wombload on the sounds. It was scary to try something this different. But it feels very rich and textural. Can't wait to put it up on the site. I hope J. Carmack sees it, and smiles proudly. Team Anox hasn't even seen it yet. Can't wait for that, too. After late nights of mentally peaking, but with great energy... I retire. Job finished. I intend to have a really good bowel movement. More like a movement AND a moment... a mouvement.

Cheers, and I swear Kenneth... Jo' Jo's will be back in your hands soon.
