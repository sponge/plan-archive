Man, it's dark in here.  'Can't see my hand in front of my face.  Maybe if I light this torch it'll be easier to find my way around this godforsaken -- Eeyaah! SPIDERS!  Getemoffgetemoffgetemoff!!    

Hey, what gives?  I just typed a bunch of stuff and none of it went through.  This is a test.  If something goes wrong again I think I might cry.

Okay, okay...
I think I have this .plan file jazz worked out now.

I type stuff in another program and paste it into the text box.  Simple.

I must confess, though, that I've been getting some peculiar email.  A Timothy Seaton (alias Dr. Bob) said it would really make his day if I extended a gracious "hello" to someone named Sarah Schneider (presumably his sweetheart), so here 'goes :

*Ahem*
"Hello, Sarah Schneider!"

I know neither of these people personally, but have a soft spot for lovebirds, being one myself.  So Tim & Sarah : best wishes.      

To anyone else who might be reading, just see me as a conduit for your positive vibes.  I don't have much use for the other variety.

Peace, Love, Unity & Respect!

I have a correction to make about yesterday's addition.
Yup.
'Seems I was wrong to refer to Miss. Sarah Schneider as the "sweetheart" of one Timothy Seaton.

"I just have to correct you on one thing." blushes Seaton, "She really is one of my best friends, but we are not lovebirds."

Poor, poor Timothy.  I too know the feeling of "just wanting to be friends" but fret not, there are plenty of eligible women out there just waiting to fall head over heels in love with you.

Good luck and Godspeed.
