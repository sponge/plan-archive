Okay, that last message was a fluke.  'Got lost somewhere, I guess.  Well, the long and short of it is...I'm engaged!  Hardly anyone will remember, but when I first started updading my plan file, I was just getting to know this cool art school girl named Wendy.  Lots of stuff has happened since then obviously :)  She's found a great graphic design job in Dallas, but we're still living apart and plan on getting married in March of 2001.

Glee!
