1) About Painter5, the solution is the fonts.
The more fonts you have the longer the pause.
I've got a few Emails from people who have 
the same problem and all of which (like me)
have a huge amount of fonts. I've cut down my
fonts and makes a huge difference and almost to no 'lag' upon start up.

2) Q2 characters not sliding? That must be in the unreleased version. Character sliding is definatly an issue to be dealt with. Unreal has it, Quake/Quake2 has it, Jedi Knight etc.. Then again, we all are entitled
to our own opinion, no matter which planet
we come from.

I also believe that Fragmasters editorial
a few days ago really hit it on the head
and for somepeople, the truth-pill can be
much to big to swallow.
