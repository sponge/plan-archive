September 29 1997

Just got finished reading the October issue of
PC Gamer. Looks like there's gonna be some
real good games coming out to play. I'm really
looking foward to playing Blade Runnner, I hope
it's not disappointing. It's been a long time
since I've played a game which really got my
attention.

It would also appear that there is a slew of
3D first-person shooters coming out (sheesh,
ya think? ;)) Tho, the one thing that kinda
upsets me is that most of them look like
they've been run through with a bottle of
pledge, they look way to new and unnatural.
But hey, that's my opinion. That's one thing
that seems lost in all these games, is a
feeling of 'time'. By that I mean it all looks
as if it was just built yesterday, everything is
too clean which doesn't really leave any
room to convey the feeling to how old or new a
world is, in otherwords, it's all to monotone.

I think it's neat to walk around a room which
is obviously old by the dirt and grit built up
over the "game-years" (stuff that looks like you
could fill up your finger nails with should you
scrap the walls) and then venture into a room
that is clean or a combo of the both. It's good
to be "dynamic".
