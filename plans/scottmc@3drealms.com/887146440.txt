Gotta love mornings...over the past few
weeks I've evolved into a morning person.
Coming in between 5:30 and 7 in the morning
having a nice cup of tea and peace and a 
little 'alone time'.  

Anyways, first thing I like to do is cruise
the web a little, trying to find some good
inspiration for the days' work ahead. Usually
I'm looking for cool 2D-3D artwork. The
only unsettling bit about it is now everyone
and thier dog are using Bryce....ick :p
Not to say it's a bad program but it seems
a little over-used. 

Anyways, here's some of the links I've found
that has some nifty stuff. It's healthy 
to look at others people stuff (art-wise)
becuase if you don't , you'll just keep
drawing the same stuff.

3D Artists -> www.raph.com/3dartists
3D Cafe    -> www.3dcafe.com

3rd Dimension -> www.finearts.yorku.ca/dzeigler


Anyway's I'm still lookin for some good 
sites will cool art...if anyone knows
of some lemme know..
