1- Dallas area game companies need to have 
   hockey teams. 

2- Parenthood is 7 months away

3- Fork calibrating is fun but only on 
   sundays after 2pm.

4- Been playing NHL'98 (still) but now against some folk at the office, not used
to the PC version , lost my first game. Playstation controllers are still much better and comfortable. Can't wait for NHL '99. Go Stars! (ok, maybe I'm a little out of season but hey, when you're Canadian, it's 24-7-365 hockey!)

4.1 - I haven't seen on PC game controller that I liked. This excludes flightsticks...
ick ;p

5- Got my eyebrow pierced. Got some pics to show off from that. Gross (Rated-R).

6- I'm proud to say that I haven't played
 starcraft...I see everyone here playing it
 I'll just enjoy it vicariously for now.

7- Why are there SO LITTLE hockey games for 
the playstation???? we have a billion football games, a few hundred thousand basketball...a couple thousand baseball games but only 3 hockey games for the playstation?
yikes. 

8- Debating wheather or not to go to Quakecon thing. Don't know yet.

9- hmmmm....goto 1
