Martin and I were having an interesting
conversation about gore in video games the
other day. We were talking about the shock 
effect it has, now with so many games containing gore it seems to have lost its
effect. Sad, but true. There really hasn't been a game that has come across to me as shocking as far as gore goes. We also talked
about whats needed to get that 'sick to your stomach' feeling or if that was even possible. For some, gore isn't much of an issue but for others , it's the icing on the
cake. Maybe for some it's all in the visuals, 
others may say it's pshycological.  Congress
may bitch that it's bad to have gore in games, too much violence. I'm sorry, but nothing thus far has been more violent than
an Arnold movie and as far as gore goes, 
again, nothing more real than a saturday morning cartoon. Maybe it's me. Hence this
weeks poll split into two parts. ;p

In a game I think ...

  ( ) Gore is overrated and means nothing
      and I don't need to see it in a video
      game.
  ( ) Gore is cool (in a video game that is)
      and I look foward to it in a game.
  ( ) I always mistake the local red-cross         for the grocery store

What I find really disturbing in a
