Textures and the Quirkiness that Follows
----------------------------------------

It's getting close to that time again where
I sift through all the old textures and
'file' them away. Maybe it's my own picky
self but if theres a texture that looks just
the slightest bit out of sync, it qualifies
for the deletetion process. At this point,
Paul usually sneaks in and removes my delete
key ;). 

Maybe it's me but I believe that textures are
a major player in how it draws the player closer into the worlds we (we=all game companies in general) create. Now that we're
not dealing with 256 colours anymore theres
no reason why we can't make the worlds photorealistic. That's my main aim, if a texture can't hold up to a photo counterpart
then it's no good to me. Looking back at the
earlier art, it really gives me the willies.
I'm constantly going back over old skins and textures updating/redoing them. Nothing is really finished, it always can be improved upon.

Again, without a 256 colour palette to stick
to, the texture process is getting closer to 
making movie props rather than plain textures
which is kind of cool if you think about it.
I have to say that from the screen shots coming out from other games, the artwork that's shown is exponentially getting deeper
and more detailed which is great becuase it
just makes the worlds that much more enriched and the player more drawn in.
