November 14 1997

Well, thought it was time for an update...it's only been
about 2 months...;)

Other than working hard I've also been playing hard too.
First it was Oddworld, man what a game that was Amazing!
The game despite a few glitches, had me glued to my
Playstation for a full weekend..and I'm not kidding! ;)
Now I've been getting into Ultima Online in a big scary way.
It's a good thing my wife's a gamer too, otherwise I'd be
toast. She plays the day shift, I play the night shift.

I'd also like to thank GT for sending me that kick-ass
Oddworld stand up...looks great! (you can see it in
Joe's new and improved virtual tour). Speaking about
Joe, he got a 'cute' pic of me in a rather embarrasing
state...please Joe, let's not post that one ok? ;p

Reviews...

Oddworld : Abe's Oddessy

  Kick friggin butt game! Great graphics, great gameplay
  and it gets Terry screamin in frustation.

Ultima Online

  I've played Ultima since the first one, took a break
  after 4, but I really like UO. Despite it's many
  'unknown-to-developer features' I think that if they
  can get everything straightned out it could be a winner!
  I love the detail put into the world, graphics could be
  better but nonetheless it keeps me glued to my computer
  througout the night.


Just to end off this plan session, I have to say to all the
folks at 3DR, you laughed at me throughout the summer while
I was sweating my butt off now it's my turn during your
ahem.."cold" winter ;) MWWAAAHAHAHAHAHA!
