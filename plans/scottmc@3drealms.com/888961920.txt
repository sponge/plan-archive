Things that go BOOM
-------------------

Ok, here's a couple of questions for all gamers out there... We all have played dozens of games will special effects of some kind. Be it, explosions, shockwaves , fire whatever.. Some have been high quality while
some look like they used some canned effect from some cheap program. 

To me, assuming that the gameplay issue has been delt with , special effects is the icing on the cake AND that it should be the most delecious icing ever. 

so here it is...

What do you look for in special effects in games and do you think it plays a big part in your gaming experience?

Games are getting better and better with SFX
and are able to do more now than ever before
but if I see one more shockwave, I'm gonna
puke....;)
