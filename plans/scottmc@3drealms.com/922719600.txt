Why is it that soooooo many RPG's (with a few exceptions) are all Medieval? 

I would much rather play a game like Fallout
than some D&D game. I mean fighting dragons
and what-not are cool and all but maybe it's just me...I realy dig on the sci-fi/futuristic stuff much more....too bad there aren't many games like that out there... :(
