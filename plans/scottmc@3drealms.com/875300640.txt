Well, finally I have a finger....courtesy of Elitegames
and now that I have one, people can stop buggin' me
to get one! ;)

Now, what to write about...well, let's start about me.
I do textures (along with Steve) for the game Prey.
This includes the artwork for environments, characters
...you name it. I have to say that it's more fun than
should be humanly allowed. Not to toot our own horns but we're
doing some pretty darn kick-ass stuff!

For textures, I am currently using Adobe Photoshop and
Fractal Design's Painter and I have to say that in my
opinion those are *the* best two programs to use for texture work.
Give me a 500lb pencil any day! 

Well it's getting late and my duck ashtray (good luck duck)
is getting full. Look for more babble speak about games,
computer art and the like as I figure out what I want
to write about.
