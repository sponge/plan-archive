-Thanks for the replies about Photoshop 5.  From what I've heard the only big additions
 that could be usefull would be multiple  undos. I've heard many positive things about  it but it still doesn't seem like anything
 that's a substantial leap from V4.

Question of the day...

Someone asked me this one day and it really
made me think (uh oh)...If you were stranded
on a desert island, given the most up to date
computer with all the peripherals you needed
and you could pick only one game to play...what would it be? (no multiplayer at all)
