Many thanks to all that have responded with
info on Starflight. I was able to get an actual cart..brand new (almost) which rocks! I was also surprised to find these 'Roms' that are for Sega emulators..but you have to own the carts in order to download so I was
at a loss...shucks. 

The main reason I was looking for it , was
that game was the one that made me want to
get into game making. It's surprising, it
had ok graphics (at the time they were pretty
darned cool) but it had that 'game-magic'. 
Detail up the wazoo, intricate story-line..
just like being the captain on the NCC-1701.
The amount of detail they put into that game
totally surpasses any game of it's time...and
not to mention, some games of even today can't top it. Now thats how you make a game...10+ years later it still retains it's 'magic'.

Not many games today have that 'magic' anymore.....
