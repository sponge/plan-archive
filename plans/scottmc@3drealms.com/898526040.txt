And now for something completly different...

- I've seen that there's a new Photoshop 5     out. Has anyone used it and/or is it worth   while to look at? 

- If you're into sports games or more so,
  into Hockey, look at NHL98. Picked that
  game up on the weekend (Playstation). I've
  just moved from NHL95 so the jump for me
  was amazing. The music is fantastic and
  all the little details that you'd expect
  from a real hockey game is in there.

- Go Italy!

- FACT: Did you know that before the world     cup soccer game between Iran & USA took
  place, the Iranian team spent weeks     preparing not only by physicial practice
  but by playing EA Sports, World Cup '98
  between USA and Iran. The did this so that
  they could realy study the players and       moves.

- Missed the X-files movie, all I wanted to 
  know was if they kissed...did they? I'm
  not a real big X-files fan so will wait
  until it comes out on Video.
