The past few nights, I've been looking for
graduates of my old high-school(s) , just to see where they are ... I remember all my teachers telling me I would be a failure and that I'd be a bum, but hey, I think that was only becuase I sold thier kid Ex-lax in the form of a new Hershey's Chocolate bar....
Anyone from Bridgewater High-School East out
there? 

Ever had real bad Heartburn? Wanna know the
cure? Peanut Butter! Seriously, take a teaspoon of Creamy (or Crunchy, whatever your preference) and gulp it down (minus the actual teaspoon) ...don't drink or eat anything else and just let the peanut butter sit there in your throat. There...that's how you solve heartburn!

Please note that as I approach my birthday 
I get a little crazy, just turn me upside down to read the "In Case of Emergency" 
sticker on my feet. 

...."Viva Las Vegas"...but what it really 
says.. "People Love Bagels"....
