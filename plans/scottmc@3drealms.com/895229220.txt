Well, here's the tally,

40% -> Doesn't care to have gore in a game
39% -> Likes gore and looks foward to it
21% -> Adores gore and never thinks there's
       enough

Out of the 39%, only a few wanted realistic
looking gore and with that thought in mind,
I was sent a letter which tackles this question dead on (pun intended). After reading his letter, there's no doubt he's
part of the 21%. :) I'd hate to run into him
in a dark ally ;)

All the wimpy little neutered godoy-goodies who want less gore should all be placed on a rocketship with no toilet facilities headed
straight for the sun.  On board this ship should be a very loud, rich-sounding stereo system which plays only Hanson music over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.

I love gore in games.  And dammit, I don't mean just a couple of red pixels here and there.  I want to see hi-res animated OpenGL blood, bone, and tissue chunks (with full colored lighting, reflections, and shadows) slide, slither, rip, explode, tear, and burn off every monster, cyborg,.demon, soldier, abandoned child, supermodel and clergyman I
shoot at in a game.  If anything, gore isn't realistic enough. I have yet to hear a sound effect that correctly reproduces the muffled crunch of vertabrae shattering, or the dull snap of a femur snapping followed by the wet tearing sound of the bone coming through the flesh.

Sound effects add a lot to the overall goryness of the gaming experience, and most games fall far short where the sound effects are concerned.  Practically every opponent that dies in every game emits some form of "AAAIIEEE!" when they die.  I'd like to hear sounds which would more accurately portray death gasps, wheezes, groans, and gurgles.  This is going to require research on the part of the game company.  Why should game companies rely on the imagination of some
sound effects guy who has never actually died?  Why not hire some hardened Viet Nam-era combat veterans who know the sounds of physical annihilation all too well?  Let's hear more of the random, uncontrolled grunts of the mortally injured cut off midway by the severance of nerves, muscles and/or airways that control vocalization.  Let's hear
the random throat noises of a guy trying to scream with his trachea protruding from his nostrils.

Another thing I would like to see involves the corpses of the people/things you kill in deathmatch games.  When you are killed, you
lie on the ground dead until you press a key to respawn.  While you are laying "dead", your corpse should twitch and wheeze and make sickening, pathetic sounds and movements until you respawn, or until someone comes
and gibs your dead body.  That would be cool.  Huh huh huhuh uhuh huhhuhuh.
