Okay...Aliens...shmaliens...I don't know if
anyone else watched UPN last night, but they
had this 'Alien Encounter' video that was
supposedly shot 'as it happened'.  That was
soooooo bad! There was this one part where a
ball of light entered the house, flew around
and hit one lady. That was SO fake! I mean
the light (animated lens flare) flew around
the room, but 2 things happened...

1) Notice the rest of the room , it was NOT
   lit along with this light

2) The light passed over this one guy, who
   ducked WAY to early not to mention that
   he wasn't even looking in the right    direction.

These were only a few things of the many that
lead me to believe that this did not happen.
In the 'home video'..we heard sooo many extra
sounds that a normal camcorder could NOT pick
up....I've seen better acting in an Adult 
film! How much did UPN Pay to do this?? I swear that they have taken some bad lessons
from FOX.

My belief, is that Aliens probably exist out
there...have we been visited? I heavily doubt
it. Seriously, all the 'visions' and stories
that have developed and told seem to reflect
on current and past sci-fi movies. Sheesh, 
All Aliens just happen to be bipeds, 2 eyes,
mouth,nose...Now, if someone came forth and
said that they saw an alien with 16 arms,
5 eyes and looked like some unearthly creature beyond imagination, then I might
believe them. Remeber when you where a kid,
and you'd draw Aliens (that you thought 
where aliens), chances are you drew something
that is in close representation to what todays 'greys' look like.

I believe that there could be E.T. out there,
I hope that there is *but* if E.T. decided to
come here, we'd know about it.
