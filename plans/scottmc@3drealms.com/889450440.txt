Thanks to the many people that responded to
my .plan about FX in games. I just want to 
say that when replying, there was a couple
of you that had 'dead' addresses so the mail
came back...just didn't want to appear rude
by not responding :) 

It also seems that we are in agreement in the
fact that with 3D hardware, FX should become
bigger and better....not just simple alpha
tricks either nor to cover up any short commings on the interactive dept.  Maybe one
day, just maybe, FX in games can grow to a point where  it will reach movie quality ;)
...wouldn't that be cool? with real looking
gibs? hmmmmmm
