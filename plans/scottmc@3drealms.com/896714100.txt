Got back from E3 and all I can say is WOW. This was my first convention and what a huge
place it was. You can not see from one end to
the other becuase it's all 'fogged' out. 

 Here's a quick break down on the games I
saw which had an 'insta-jiz' effect

 - Tresspasser
   Great physics model, fabulous in fact
   but will hold off until I see gameplay.

 - Oddworld Abe's Exodus
   Was hoping to play it but only saw a    video and artwork/sketches. Oddworld's       Artwork is without a doubt *the best* I've    ever seen. With that in mind, thier story    is kick-ass and if they have the same       gameplay as the first this is a sure-fire    hit.

 - Max Payne
   Tho this may be like tooting your own horn
   but nonetheless it's an entirly different
   team doing it. WOW!. Animation, Artwork,
   effects...pretty fargin great! I really 
   want to play this.

 - Duke Nukem Forever
   (same disclaimer as above) but these
   guys have made something look not only
   amazing but mind-numming to play. Duke
   will deliver and if you didn't know better
   you'd never know it was the Quake2    engine... never.

 - Half-life
   What really drew me was the scripted stuff
   that was shown. That was some really       awsome stuff. It looks like they put a lot
   into the environment to make it real.
 

There is many other games which looked good,played good like Fallout2 and Balder's Gate that I also look forward to playing.
As far as the Prey floor video goes, out of
a million dollars worth, it would be about 
a shilling. With regards to Randy's comment
about the video thats his own and if he wants
to start a pissing contest , again thats up to him ;p 

E3 was a big success and hords of fun, even
for big Tequlia drinkers like George ...MWAAHHAHAHA
