- Woah, a lot of people wrote about the deserted island thing. Thanks. It seems to
me that the vast majority of responses were
games that really have stood the test of time. Games like Civ2(a chunk of people wanted this game), Might&Magic, Master of
Orion, various sports games. Some even said
MS Visual C++ so they can code thier own games. Believe it or not only 3 (out a *chunk* of people) said games like Doom2 and
Unreal.  This is kinda surprising in a way,
but in some ways, not. 

Surprising in a way that despite how popular
FPS games are, gamers seem to deny themselves
the replay value to get a quick shoot-em up.
We've all seen quake mods that show you how
fast to complete a level, by knowing where
the monsters are, they complete these
games in an amazing time. This leads me to the whole topic of "Replay Value". 

Only a small handfull of games out today have it. Well, let me rephrase that, all games have it but only a few make it unique each time. Like Sports games , sim games even
some action games. We all want it or at least
I would think so. Heck, if I was stuck on some island I would NEED a game that I could
keep playing while still maintaining unique gameplay. 

It's a subject that seems underestimated. I remeber in the old days on the C64 or Atari 2600, Missle Command rocked just like Astroids. These where games that I think a lot of people today would still play. Why? Replay value.

Ok, if you've read this far you're problaby
saying "Where am I going with this?", well
simply put replay value is slowly becoming
extinct and my friends is what I am troubled
about. What good does a game do for us when
we can actually time ourselves, we then step
'above' the game , ignoring the game almost
entirely to which it's just stripped to nothing more than a race. Wow, big deal..
On there other hand, there are a TON of good
mods out there for Quake,Duke,Swarrior,Quake2
that keep these games alive perhaps that's the new form of replay value.

out there somewhere is the worst doctor ever
