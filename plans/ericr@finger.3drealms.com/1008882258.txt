Mmm... the smell of .plan files in the afternoon.

WARNING: ANOTHER POINTLESS PLAN UPDATE
----------------------------------------

So I've been playing this little game called AirFix Dogfighter. I had never heard of it before one of the guys here had me check it out. I've been pretty addicted to this game for the past few weeks. While I wouldn't quite call it a flight sim, nor a shooter, nor an arcade game it has a pleasant mixture of all three. WW2 toy model fighter planes, giant sized environments, blowing stuff up, collecting powerups, getting in dogfights. What more can you ask for?

If you have something like a Logitech Wingman Gamepad I highly recommend this game. Very arcadey feel to it. Why isn't this game on consoles? And you can't beat the $12 price. Graphics are decent if you crank the resolution pretty high. However, this game isn't about graphics.

So many lesser known games which somehow happen to be more fun than AAA titles. Tisk tisk! The quest for fun continues!
