And now for something completely different... ...a bit of Pythonesse.  I'm always amazed at how accurately Monty Python captured the human beast.  I can barely observe anything anymore without being reminded of one of their skits, spoofs, or vinuettes.  I'll also frequently discover that what seemed to be merely one of their splashes of British nonsense humor was in fact based on actual history.  There was, indeed, a sect of Christianity that thought anything smooth must be holy (Seekers of Smooth Things).  Last night I watched an incredibly informative and very entertaining special on castle seiges (can't remember the show's name nor even the station).  Anyhow, it was centered about the French and English and discribed how both sides would hurl dead animal carcasses at each other hoping to infest the opponents with disease and at least a foul smell and disgust... ...RUN AWAY!

Another bit of interesting fair... ...you know the English version of flipping someone off?  ...the two fingers raised in a backward peace/victory signal?  Know where that came from?  Apparently the French were so pissed at the devastating effects of the English and their Welsh Long Bows, that any archer caught would have his two fingers cut off.  The archers, therefore, would flash their two fingers at the French as a taunt... ...very cool, yes?  ...now go away or I shall... ...oh, just bugger off!

It wasn't me, Officer! ...I don't even smoke any more!  Got here at 6am this morning, cruising off the highway into the lovely West End when what do I see? ...the Ritual offices on fire!  Yes, yes, 3 fire trucks and an assortment of other municiple vehicles circling our offices.  It turns out that one of the bars downstairs had a bad neon sign... ...bad sign, bad!  Harry's office, situated just above this sign, is a real mess and he's gonna love seeing this when he arrives.  The lo-ly levelord got pictures, BTW... ...film at 11.  ...or whenever the Digitally Challenged arrives today ;)

Well, well, well, ...the psychosis spreads!  I get to work pretty fricken early, pretty fricken sick early, actually.  I get in this morning at 5:30 and look who's here - Mr. Paradox!  Sick, sick, sick.

Speaking of sick, I found a piece of perversion right here in the Dallas Alley.  We've got this rather robust country singer that used to torture us with the same six songs each and every night when our offices were on the other side of the building.  Anyhow, just before I left yesterday, at about 2pm, I stopped by the restroom to make sure the tank was empty and ready for bouncing and careening up 75.  As I finished my tinkle, I heard the women's bathroom flush next door.  As I washed the piddies, I heard the women's door open and close.  Strange, me thinks to me self?  The Rolling Weider and I are the only ones in the office... ...who could be in the girlie's loo?  Well, as I headed for the elevator just around the corner from the latrines, who is standing there with a shit-eaten grin but our beloved 300lb country boy.  He had just come to rest from walking away from the bathrooms, BTW.  Now, I didn't "see" all this connected, but again, there were only two level designers in the building, I heard the female can flush and the women's head door open and shut, and then I saw this prevo dude.  I hope it's not true, ...I mean, we do not allow that shit in Texas, but there you have the facts as I saw them.

...Ahhhhh!  ...the Digitally Challenged One is here, too!  ...we've gone clinical and need help!

The Decline of American Culture?  ...well, what has happened to today's youth!  We had a Ritual picnic yesterday (Mother Miller is always looking after our all-round well being) and I must say that I am depressed (we should have gone much further, much faster) with the state of the next generation.  When we had picnics in my time, everyone tried their best to loose as many brain cells as possible.  There were potables and smokables, droppables and inhalents, and just about any psychotropic substance imaginable.  Today? ...the kids go to a party and they play computer games!  Where we were into heavies like horse, they're into the MULE.  It's sad, it's pathetic, and I don't understand... ...I want to go home!  ...;)

Actually, it was a very cool party on a very beautiful day.  Although there was indeed a large "group" of pasty-white tribespeople inside playing games most of the day, we did have a great time!

Is it really Dallas, or is it just me?  You know how you become sensitive to certain things once you become aware of them... ...like you buy a new red Suburban and all of a sudden that's al you seem to see... ...red Suburbans, ...or you hear the name Rubenowitz for the first time and then all of a sudden you hear of a dozen other Rubenowitzs?  ...Rubenowitzii? ...whatever.  Anyways, it seems that every time I hear of some fruitcake person or wacko (sounds like Waco) event... ...it's in Dallas.  For instance, I watch The Daily Show and they have a section called "God's Stuff" in which the do short exposes on religious nuts.  Last night they did a half dozen or so and, yes, most of them seemed to hail from right here down yonder way.  Great show, BTW, and does anyone else think Craig Kilborn is a clone for Doug Wood (Valve artist, did a little Duking, too)?
