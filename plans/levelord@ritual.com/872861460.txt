Hmmmm... ...saw an interesting show last night on A&E called "The Unexplained".  It did in fact leave me wondering.  The topic was the use of psychotropic substances on other things than recreational reasons, specifically, the enhancement of creativity while tripping.  The last segment focused on the proposed effects that psychodelics had on the computer industry in it's infancy years.  A Bob Wallis, founding member of Microsoft, said while talking about new marketing techniques that he in fact invented the concept of shareware and the method of giving away part of the product and selling the rest... ...hmmmm, I thought I just left the company that invented shareware, ...truly unexplained.

Just returned from The Fray and must say that is was indeed a trip.  It wasn't as big as M3 or QuakeCon, but it was well-planned and alot of fun.  I wish I could have stayed longer.  The Cyberweb Cafe is awesome, too!  This is what an internet cafe should be... ...open, full bar with a sandwich/pastry shop to-boot and, ...oh yes, internet terminals.  I had a really great time at the party and want to thank all the Cyber Dudes for their efforts.

On a lighter side, I found a way to make sweet lemonade out of what has been, at least for me, a truly sour mouthful.  Until now, I have had nothing but anger and frustration at all the phone soliciting that I get.  At least three times a month I get hauled off the toilet or from the middle of cooking or some other activity to answer the phone... ...only to find that it's fricken AT&T (who I will NEVER employ again) asking me to switch long distance service.

Anyhow, I have a solution that will have you on the floor laughing each and everytime you use it.  When the bastard asks for "the decision-maker", tell him/her to hang on while you go get them.  Yell out a "Honeyyyy... ...it's AT&T about that long distance you wanted...".  I have found that the dup will stay there waiting for at least 1-2 minutes.  You can elongate the bastard's downtime by, at approximately 1-2 minutes, picking up the phone and asking if the decision-maker has answered yet.  When they say "No", reassure them that you'll go check.  You can an additional 2-3 minutes this way.  Try it... ...it's funnier than shit to go about your original task and occasionally pick up the phone to hear the silent waiting, ...just a suggestion.

It's so cool! ...Father Rob put a red light bulb in the spot light that shines on our front door.  It looks almost as real as the colored lighting in our games, too!

Wow... ...this has to be one of the coolest things yet...  ..."Scourge of Armagon" got #1 in Top Action Game *and* Top 100 Games of Computer Gaming World's Reader Poll (Sept. 1997).  Sorry for sitting on the laurels, but this is so coool!

Well, ...it's over and done, ...and it was truly awesome.  The showing at QuakeCon `97 was beyond expectation and, other than a few priliminary power problems, all went extremely well.  Hats off to Holiday Inn for catering to our every need, BTW.

We invited Elexis Sinclaire's sister, Elana, to hand-out SiN shirts.  Actually, being the sister of sinister Elexis, she forced the Quakers to work for their shirts... ...no free give-aways from this family.  Many-a-Quaker had to subject himself to tortuous whipping (with their own belts!), acts of social debasing (boot-kissing and bent-kneed poetry swooning), and anatomical queries.

One of the queries was to guess the size of Elana's... ...errr, ...cups.  True to the definition of geek, one Quaker blerted out "22R".  22R!  ...that's the caliber of a very small rifle, not the dimension of these artillery-sized barrels.  Blue, in a blast of brilliance, tagged her immeditely as a 38D.  The man knows his shells!

As a small anecdote... ...Saturday morning I was passing the conference room after breakfast and caught the tail-end of a conversation between an older couple and their daughter who, obviously, were not there for the convention.  The wife, hearing the explosions and gunplay from the conference room, exclaimed to the husband "Gee, I thought that Quakers (the Religious Society of Friends) were against violence!?!"

Tom and I held a level designing seminar with Steve and Jim from Rogue.  They really are goofballs and it really is cool working with them.  I was afraid that the event would be a small gathering, with each side only staring at each other for a half an hour.  However, it turned into a very informative (thanks crowd for the intelligent questions and worthy idea swapping) and humorous (thanks Steve and Jim for the comic relief) two hours.

Ion Storm held an very cool side party Saturnight at a nearby hotel; those bastards do know how to throw a party!  Just about everyone was there... ...from the Ionics themselves (where were you Dr. Sleep!), to the Ritualistics, to the Roguish Wonderers, to the Apostles of Apogee (now know as The Church of 3D Realms).  Billy and his Society of the Damned finished-off the evening with a demonic jam that I thought would surely get us all tossed from the hotel.

Word has it that there may be a British QuakeCon this year.  Let's all hope so; I've never seen the UkCon before.

It like Woodstock in Plano!  QuakeCon is indeed fricken HUGE!  There's about 700 people there, computers galore, and the floor looks like some spaghetti factory blew up.  They've dropped the power cicuit and can only support less than half the computers, so today they're driving in an industrial power generator... ...way cool.  On the way home last night, I'd swear I saw the lights of the Dallas skyline dim on and off a few times.

=================
07/15/1997

Holy sheep shit!  I swung by QuakeCon last night and this year's gathering is going to be HUGE!  I remember last year when maybe 100 people showed, this year we've leaped by an order of magnitude.

Dozens feared killed by Quake in Venezuela!?!   ...Oh my god! ...What have we done!
