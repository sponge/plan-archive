Sad news indeed... ...not many of you knew him, but he was a hell of a guy.  Dennis Scarff has passed away ;(  I knew him at Apogee and, although I only shared smoke breaks with him throughout the year, I really was heartbroken to hear that he's gone.  Those of us that knew you, sir, were more than pleased to ride with you!

Okay, on to brighter things.  The Tribe of Ritual is surely the humblest and never do they sing their own praises or sit on any thorny laurels.  However, I'd like to thank the incredibly sightful people at Computer Gaming World for naming "The Scourge of Armagon" as the Best Add-on Pack of 1997 (March 1998 issue, pg 89).  There's even a bit about "arguably the best deathmatch level." or something like that ;)

Mr. Superstar Wieder (please see his .plan, if you haven't)!  We don't often get recognized by the female counterpart so it's a rare and charished event when we do ;)  The Levelord has a similar story, although it crashes hard at the end... ...he was in an Arby's a few months ago, waiting in line for a dilectable, fat-laiden "roast beef" (a mere vehicle for the Arby's Sauce, actually), when a beautiful blonde in the adjacent line recognized me.  She remembered me from the Duke Nukem CD.  She quite a piece... ...professionally dressed (always a plus `cause it usually means she's got *some* money), golden blonde hair, very nice figure, and SHE was the one that started-up the conversation.  Well, don't `cha know our lord immeditely ran out to his classic van and grabbed a copy of Duke for the lass... ...even giving up his place in line to do so.  When he returns, the gamerette was already sitted.  With the urbanity of a true swashbuckler, he hands het the CD and she responds... ..."Oh!  Thank you!  My husband LOVES this game!"  Nose-dive city, ...few survivors expected!

While we're here... ...Giggler cute?!?  If the Rolling Wieder's groupie knew he requires 16 AAA batteries each day, she'd sing a different tune, me thinks!  He does say "Mutha"" when you push in his stomach, though, and that's a plus I guess.

God bless American... ...especially its automobiles.  I must confess that I currently drive a Jap car.  I'm in need of a new car and have been thinking about getting a cool big American hog like a Suburban, old Nova, or even a Herse.  After the accident I saw this morning on the way to work, I'm convinced!  It was a nasty, nasty three-car pile up in which a 1980's Buick had broadsided a Corolla, which then struck another import.  The Corolla had been converted from an already cramped 6-foot interior girth to a new 2-foot.  The third car was likewise totalled by the crushed Corolla.  The Buick was sitting in what looked like its original point of contact with bearly a scratch.  It was obvious who walked away and who heard the sirens.

Related to violence, we have a new hobby at the office... ...The Jerry Springer Show!  I thought that this was just another gab-and-sob show, but I was greatly mistaking!  I stayed at home for the holiday seasons and happened to catch this show.  It is awesome... ...more beeping than actual words, coldcock crosscuts to the face, cool cat fights between women who know no rules to fighting.  One show had two women going at it for the entire show, ...punching, throwing, grabbing fistfuls of hair and not releasing as the stage hounds tried to pull them apart.  By the end of this show, they each had huge areas of scalp showing with blood oozing from the wrenched follicles. ...Way cool!

1998!  ...no way!  ...I'm still having a hard time accepting that it's almost Artist-Formerly-Not-Known-As-Prince Party Time.  Two more years, ...short years, and it will be 2000... ...no way!

Anyhow, I've had the second-most coolest thing (first being the JFK ride last week) happen to me in the past year... ..."The Worst of 1997" special on www.pcme.com!  There's a certain credit issue that just warms my heart and a "Hat's Off!" goes to Rod White for including it.   Thank you, sir!   Related... ...it's been rumored that the Quake Community is amiss that Q2 was included.  Having read the article a second time, it seems obvious enough that this was not meant as slam against the game.  Easy, kids, easy!

Actually, there's a third cool thing happening... ...someone else is doing our add-on pack for SiN.  We've been mulling over this for sometime now (deciding on the best team, time lines, etc.), but it really didn't sink in to me until today that THIS time SOMEONE else is doing a pack for me!  ...that sounds uncharacteristically egocentric and self-serving, I know, but I just never thought I'd see this day ;)

Holy sheep shit!  Wired Magazine came to shoot Paradox and me for an up-n-coming special.  They rented the limo that JFK was shot in and ran us up and down Dealy Square... ...it was very cool!  There were alot of tourists looking and gawking as they tried to see if they recognized who we were... ...they didn't... ...yet ;)

Thanks to all those related to the dead aunt, especially Ben and Darrin!  Interestingly, of the dozen or so people I told this story to here in Dallas, all the females asked the same question... ..."Did they do an autopsy?".  They did, and it was a massive heart attack.  ...no, really!

A bit of "what it's like IN the industry"... ...Rob and I were looking for the Quake II CD the other day while everyone else was out to lunch.  Everyone has the same stack of CDs piled on their desk and everyone has the same CDs in those piles... ...almost exclusively of NIN, Metallica, and Manson.  I bet we could save ALOT of cash by sharing ;)

Got an email from Scotty-Boy saying that he saw some dudes wearing SiN T-shirts at the Lords of Acid concert last night in Austin... ...very, very cool indeed.  Wide-scale advertising for the cost of $6!

Finally, and truly trivially, I rented McHale's Navy the other day and had a tickle when Binghamton first got to the island and threatened to send them all to the "...remotest island down the Aleutian chain if they didn't square away ASAP!".  That would be Adak, Alaska, where his lo-ness himself spent 13 months listening for those dirty, evil Soviet submarines.

Be careful of what you wish for... ...I have an aunt and uncle in Connecticut.  The uncle is my Dad's brother and he married a German frau while serving in the Army in the 1960's.  I think I love the German language so much because I spent alot of time with Ingrid and she practiced her American on my forgiving 5-year-old ears.  Anyhow, their marriage has seen some bad waters the past few years and it got to the point where Ingrid has been sleeping on the couch.  Evidently, Saturnight was a bad one and my uncle yelled "I wish you were dead!" as he escaped for bed.  When he and my cousin awoke on Sunday morning... ...there lay Ingrid as cold as the Connecticut morning!   Ouch! ...my uncle is really bumming, as you can imagine, and all I can think about is not being a Dick as often as I am with those around me.

sCary is!  He's all over us about sticking something in our fingers... ...god, he can be a real dick sometimes!  Just to shut him up, here's a little bit of interest, and it's kind of related to SiN, too.  

We've got this sink in our kitchen and it's one of the most disgusting, primordial soup-sess pools I've ever seen!  ...and I've lived in enough to know!  I was just washing my hands and, while going through the rinse cycle, a big chunk of some quasi-biomass belched up from the drain.  It was then followed by a small community of very naughty bits indeed.  This sink, although it's swallowed a good three bottles of Draino, just doesn't seem to want to come clean and gobs of goo are frequently swirling in it's basin and trap.   I don't know what's living down there, but it has given me some great inspiration for The Xenomorphic level I'm working on... ...disgusting!

I suppose while I've got you here, I can do a little mention of one of my favorite cities and the goofballs at Quakecast.  New York is so cool!  I really do love the smell of the subway as it breaths its death, decay, and machine oil scents up through the street grates.  It doesn't make sense, because it's a pugnant, revolting smell, actually, but I guess it's similar to how a fly loves the smell of shit... ...I do love New York.  I'm not much for walking around, but there is so much shit going on that I can easily spend eight hours just tooling around watching it all.  You can buy just about ANYTHING your sick, little heart desires and all the weird fucking fruitcakes walking around loose make for a very cool show.  Then there's the pizza, and the constant fear of death from a screaming yellow taxis... ...god, I do love that city!

The Village has some of the coolest shops!  I found an Alex (Clockwork Orange - if you haven't, you MUST see this movie!) and a Charlie Manson figurine for my desk.  I'm always worried about setting the right image when the press come to visit, you know.  I've got a good 10-year stockpile of Wallabees now, too.  Not only can I find Wallabees in New York; I can find green Wallabees ;)

Quakecast was alot of fun.  The studio is set-up quite professionally now... ...real plugged-in, techno like.  I was a bit dismayed when I first got there this time, though.  The place was all decked out Quake-like when I was there for M3, but this time, the main rooms were filled with artsy fartsy shit like some SoHo gallery... ...very chic, very chic indeed.  The Judge and Jury had me laughing hysterically and I recommend at least a quick listen of last Thursday's show.

I had an interesting flight home.  You know how airplanes usually lift straight away and steady to the cruising altitude after take-off?  Well, after only a minute or three of climbing, the plane suddenly levelled off.  I immediately thought "Cool!  ...An engine stall or we've thrown a turbine blade or something!".  Figuring we all have to go sometime, and doing so in a big, dramatic ball of flames would be an exciting way out, I usually get more excited than terrified with airplane-related 'events'.  Anyhow, I was looking out the window, back towards the engines, when all of a sudden a Leer jet zoomed by directly over us and only about 100ft above! ...even cooler! ...a near midair collision!  We were still over Connecticut and no where near New Jersey, BTW, so here again I wasn't really worried about hitting the ground ;)

An amusing little anecdote reared its head a couple of weeks ago, and since no one else seems to want to put their finger on it, ...the lord will.  It's a shame, really, that it wasn't reported more closely to its occurrence, because it's lost some of its zeal.   ...and we had photos, too!

In this story, we'll change the names again to protect the innocent.  Mike "Giggle Me This!" Wardwell's birthday happened a few weeks ago.  Not just any birthday, mind you, but his 21st.   Our little boy is all grown-up, Marge ;(  We wanted to make sure that it was a memorable birthday for him, so we took him to Baby Dolls uptown.  Besides being his birthday, it was also Friday, ...so, you know.

We went to this den of will repute and were soon being entertained by a bevy of Texan beauties.  A particularly adorable one immediately picked out our new hunter from the tribe.  There seemed to be magic in the air, ...you could smell it, and Harry "Pssst, Come Here, I've got lots of twenties..." made sure to let her know it was her target's, ...ummm, ...new friend's Cumming of Age Ritual.

Veronica!  Veronica "Play My Flute Like a Harmonica!" was truly charming, and soon we learned why Mike is called The Giggler.  It was embarrassing, actually, but hey, he's part of the kinship and we have to accept him!  I was soon to learn, though, what had him snickering so childishly.  Miss Birthday Box peeled herself from Giggler's lap and bedicked, ...ah, bedecked mine.  ...just thinking about this story has me all choked up in romance, ...anyway, no sooner had she straddled my leg did I feel this vice-grip wrenching around my thigh.  It was incredible, this girl!  Nautilus must be doing some whacked things lately.  We're talking labial pinching here, not squeezing her thighs around mine.  It was like having a horse try to peel oats from the side of my leg.  It was incredible!  She smiled a knowing smirk and was soon barnacled back on the birthday boy.

Some time passed, and some beers, and then I passed some of the beers.  When I got back, Veronica looked over at me while she slightly pulled down Giggler's shirt neck.  She was grimacing in painfully restrained hysteria as she showed me about a half a dozen of the biggest, most purpled sucker bites I have ever seen!  Any of you Trekkies or old farts remember that original Star Trek that had an alien that would suck the salt out of you and leave these horrific suction marks in the process?  ...Mike looked worse!  ...much worse!

Mrs. Giggler, the Mother of All Things Gigglish, was due in town to visit her son the very next morning, BTW.

I knew it, ...I just knew it!  There was a fire truck, sirens a' blarin' and lights a' flashin', out in front of the Ion Storm building this morning!  ...I knew all that hair was a fire hazard!

...BTW, thanks back at cha, Master Cloud ;)

The following is a story.  It is only a story and does necessarily relate to any truth or actuality.  The names have been changed to protect the innocent... ...as well as the guilty.

It seems this dude, we'll call him Dick, came to work the other day only to find that the parking lot was packed to near capacity.  Dick was running late and needed to park.  There were available spaces way at the top of the parking structure, he was sure, but there was also a nice spot still open right near the elevator.  The only problem was that this spot was being half-consumed by some fruitcake in the adjacent spot that didn't have the time to park straight and correct.  This happens alot and I'm sure you can appreciate Dick's frustration at the inconsiderable piggish parking that ruined an otherwise prime location.

Dick drives a van and exiting his vehicle from either side is quite convenient for him.  With that in mind, he inched his car into the 2/3 slot, thus blocking the driver's door of the offensive bastard one over.  Two birds with one stone Dick thought...a cool parking spot AND a little "Consider this, asshole!" to-boot.

As many of these things do, the situation escalated.  When Dick was leaving at the end of the day, he noticed a hand-written note on his windshield stating something to the effect of "You blocked me out of my car, you hit my right front bumber in doing so, I've taken down your liscense number, and I've filed a police report."  The twit even added a report number which, we figure, was to make Dick really sweat over his foul deed.

Well, Dick didn't hit the bumber, but he did sweat about the note.  He figured the best thing to do was to likewise take down the other person's liscense... ...which he did.  The next morning, at spying the hog dog's car again, he took down their liscense... ...I mean he took
