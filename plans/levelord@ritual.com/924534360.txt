There's a story behind the "Name the two guys in the picture" that ran on Blue's... ...anyone care to hear it?  ...cool!  This is indeed the Good and Humble Levelord who got the chance to meet one of his heros while at UCLA.  At the time, Robin Williams and Clint Eastwood were the only two respectable Hollywood types.  What a great opportunity you might think, but alas, it was not.

I'm not sure how much of this is true, so please do not quote me, but there were reasons why Robin looked so blue at the time.  Normally a very aminated and entertaining person, he looked like this the entire afternoon.  I found out later that he was putting away the Peruvian Marching Powder, an obvious stage tool for his first ten years.  He also was being divorced by his wife after getting the Latina maid pregnant.  Even worse, his dad had just died.  Again, other than his dad's death, I don't know for sure about the other reasons, but I have never been so dissapointingly suprised as by this chance meeting.

...he did tell me one funny thing, though, that I still remember to this day.  "Richard" he said, "One Levelord beats a Paradox!"

It is with great embarrassment that I forgot to mention the "other" most hilarious web site on the net...

...just read it if you're feeling Blue, ...no wait, ...I mean, it will make you feel up, ...I mean, like, ...when you're down.  Thanks for the head's-up, Master Stotler!

Long time, no finger ;(  I just had to reference this page because it has made me laugh more than anything else in recent years.  I highly recommend a daily visit to Old Man Murray's...

It can be brutal and down right cruel to game developers, ...hell, it slams just about anything that's not nailed down, but it's too funny to miss no matter who you are.  I risk alienation by some of my comrads perhaps, for taking sides with Marvin and his bastardly crew, but having been a prime target myself, I feel no shame in this referal.

...how's THAT for gaming news, Chet?!

Also pointedly related to gaming news, people need to email our esteemed artisan extrordinaire John Mueller (butcher@ritual.com) and get him to finger his Timothy Leary Story (he's not dead, just outside looking in, BTW).

There should be a law!  When you meet someone who has an identical twin, they should have to tell you so!  I was at GamesCon in Toronto this weekend, ...a very very cool gaming event, ...but we'll get to THAT later.  Anyhow, the fest was organized by Mark Chandler.

I arrived late Frinight and after checking in to the hotel, headed straight for the bar.  I had to taste authentic Canadian beer, ...you know.  Anyhow, I spent a good 3 hours partying with Mark and an assortment of fellow gamers.  One of the conversations was about how we have all met just enough people to start forgetting names and faces when we are re-introduced to people at these sort of events.  The ended well.

The next morning, I arose early and had a great room-service breakfast before heading down to check on the day's events.  Walking down the hallway, I met Mark.  Except when I said "Hey, Mark!", the dude looked at me funny and said "I'm not Mark!".

Panic attacked and I got flustered.  I hate not remembering people, fearing the insult it may incur.  The dude looked just like Mark, though!  We chatted for about 5 minutes and then split our ways.

It wasn't until later that day that I found out that Mark has an identical twin Glen, ....bastards!  They will pay for that, they will pay ;)

The GamesCon event itself was awesome and is highly recommended (rumors have it that there may be another one later this year).  It was like a QuakeCon and E3 all wrapped into one.  Very well organized, too.



On the news wire... ...I recently posted an small snippet on 3DGaming.net about all the gamer bashing that occurred this year.  

     http://www.3dgaming.net/stuff/bitchslap/

...and guess who sent the most emails related to the article?  You bet, the bashers ;)  Seems turn about is NOT in fact fair play.  Oh well...  

Seriously, for those wondering why the piece was written so late, I was busy with SiN and only now can find the time to write about frivolous things.  The motive?  As I said, I love the abuse and welcome more.  Actually, I understand more has already been posted in places(?)  The motive, though, was more for the side-effects and innocent by-standers that get hurt with this shit.  

Did I "lower" myself to their realms?  Yes, ...yes indeed ;)

Shopping on Figuroa... ...I was reminded of another story Dick told me a bit ago, and since there's so much free time lately, I thought I'd share it.  This one took place back in 1986 while he and a childhood friend of his were living in Los Angeles.  

Dick was going to school to get a cool engineering degree and his friend, Deter, had just recently moved to LA to take a new engineering job.  This is important because it explains why neither could afford any substantial amount of Californian Salad and had to make weekly trips downtown for their quick, tin foil-wrapped refills.

Shopping on Figueroa was usually pretty cool and easy... ...slide up curbside in the auto, wave a hand, and three or more Entrepreneuritos would rush up and trade a small clump of tin-foiled wacky weed in exchange for a mere $10.  However, this one trip, and their last to Figueroa, would prove much more exciting.

Deter was a fairly big dude and was in fairly good shape.  He was also raised in a meager Irish Catholic household with six other siblings.  Translation... ...Deter was not afraid of too much that met him, to the point of being senseless sometimes.

Instead of the usual drive-in service, this last visit to Figueroa started with Deter having to actually get out of the car and walk to the dilapidated building housing the street vendors.  Dick, BTW, was driving his father's fairly new car, as his own Nova had recently blow-up, literally.  Deter proceeding to the house, about 1/2 a block up the street from where Dick was parked.

Dick, anticipating a wait, turned on the radio and kicked back with a mule.  No sooner had he lit his cigarette than Deter came running by the car at full speed yelling "Dick! Dick! Get going!  Now!!!".  Directly behind Deter followed four homies and they were gaining on Deter fast.

Dick, thinking quickly as any good Dick will do, jammed the ignition and floored the Buick out and into the street.  He needed a quick 180 and fortunately there was an empty lot just ahead unfortunately, Figueroa was a one way street.  No matter, when a friend is in as much need as Deter seemed to be the adrenaline rushed and Dick pulled into the lot to set up for his daring rescue.  Thanking god that American cars still had read wheel drive, he fish tailed a beautiful half-doughnut, spewing dust and dirt into a big feather-shaped cloud, and got back onto Figueroa in less than a second.  Figueroa was, again thanking all deities, fairly empty of what would be oncoming traffic.

Starksy and Hutching it a block down to Olympic, Dick re-entered correct traffic and he soon caught up to Deter.  The Chinos were fast on him and Deter's left sneaker flew off his foot just as Dick caught up to him.  The Homies were a mere few feet behind Deter by this time.  Dick reached over, frantically opened the passenger door, and yelled for Deter's attention.  Still going a good 5 mph, Deter leaped into the car and Dick floored it to safety.

It turns out that this whole ordeal was because Deter didn't like the visual quality of the Salad he had bought and wanted his $10 back.  After asking for the refund and being refused, laughed at, actually, he evidently just grabbed the 10 spot from the net stocking-headed hood and ran.  Ten bucks and a clump of horse weed... ...Dick risks his dad's Buick through a half dozen near misses, Deter his very flesh and blood... ...and all for a meager ten bucks!  Not much of a story, I know, but a message just the same Drugs are badddd, mmmmkay?!

1999!  ...I get the feeling this is going to be a bad year, ...very bad indeed.

In case anyone will be in the area, I'm heading for the Great White North on the last weekend in February for the GamesCon Extravagancy (http://www.gamescon.com/page.cfm).  They've asked me to talk about level designing or some shit, but I told them it would be better if I shared my experiences with submarine hunting in the Cold War or cultivating Californian Salad in cold New England.

I can't just leave you with that, though, so here's a little pre-Levelord story.  It's from a time long ago, before I saw the light and became a level designer,  I was a bit jockey, actually.  I am reminded of this story because I just replaced the old `89 Yoter van with a brand new `99 one.  A little tear of times-gone-by welled in my eye as I looked in my new rearview mirror at that old, decrepit van in the used car lot.   What a great car slammed at 50+ mph into two highway embankments and starts right back up again, three oil changes in 81K miles of driving, 1
