Time is such a precious commodity right now... ...there's so much to tell about Elexis and Ireland and Elexis and... ...here's a quickie for you at least... ...it's called, ..."Elexis and the Bag Piper".

The last night of the castle gig was extra special.  ActuVision hired two bag pipers to stand out front and great us as we returned to the castle for dinner.  It was quite impressive... ...being in Ireland, two pipers playing against the backdrop of a 13th century castle.  I didn't know whether I wanted to cry or go off to fight a war.  Bag pipes always make me all goose pimply ;)

Anyhow, after about 15 minutes, everyone had filtered in where the alcohol was... ...of course.  I was more in tune to listening to the pipers and catching a lonely smoke outside.  Within a minute, my dear Elexis showed up to join me... ...in a fag, ...err, cigarette ;)  She leared and stared at one of the pipers and she puffed long and slow on her cigarette.  He kept doing that quick shift of the eyes and then almost immediately pop them back forward again.  He was obviously very flustered.

Well, our girl wasn't satisfied with this alone so she meandered over the piper and give him one of her slaps on the shoulder and a "Naughty boy!".  That was it... ...the pipes went squelch and he dropped them to the floor.  He was NOT amused and gave Elexis a very dirty look.  She scuffed and returned to her creator, ... errr, me.  After a few more drags of her smoke she went off for the drinks.  I asked the piper if he was really upset and with a look of ice he said "Yessss!  Dunny everrr doo that agin! ...everrr".

As pointed out in numerous emails... ...the castle's name was Lutterstown Castle, a name that seemed to baffle the Yankee tongue at first, but one that by week's end rolled off the tongue with the litest lilt.  Speaking of lilts, Ireland has a strange of rubbing off, or infecting maybe, all those that visit.  Most of us had picked up a detectable Irish flair to our accent within a few short days.  Maybe it's the water ;)

Okay, okay... ...on to the center ring and the star of our show... ...the Wicked Elexis!  ActiVision did a superb job and hired a gorgeous model to play the role of our beloved villainesse.  Other than having a slightly softer face than our in-game version, she was perfect!  ...right down to the (although healed now) belly button peircing.  She was all real, too, no DuPont to be fondled... ...er, found, ...sorry.

ActiVision had a custom outfit made and Elexis' act was incredible.  Although the face may have been softer, the attitude was all that we originally envisioned.  Elexis would stroll the groups of press and distributors, whacking the males on the shoulder... ...or elsewhere, and say "Naughty boy!".  You could see the newly immerging beads of sweat glisten on the forehead of her victim... ...even the normally cool-and-collected Mediterraneans ;)

She quickly learned who I was and from then on called me "Creator!".  I still got abused like everyone else, but it was chest-filling (my chest) to hear here exclaim that as she crossed the room towards me.  Sorry, Michael... ...someone had to play the role of creator ;)

Although one grew accustomed to it quickly, every so often I would pull back from the crowd and realize what an incredible event this really was.  I remember the "old" world in which many Europeans wouldn't be caught dead, or they would be caught dead, in the same room as some of the attending coutries.  I believe just about every Western and Central Europe nation was represented... ...from the newest Slovatnia to the grandest Nederlands.  

Particularly cool was to wine and dine and talk computer games with my new Russian comrad Serge from GameLand magazine in Moscow.  Does anyone else remember not so long ago when we were pointing big, nasty guns at each other?  Now, we're playing deathmatch together... ...way cool!  Serge brought me a bottle of REAL Russian vodka... ...me, one of the dudes that would listen for their new Tango Class Soviet Nuclear Submarine as it slipped down the Kamchatski Peninsula for the first time just 20 years ago.  What a great turn of events!  "Computer games saved the world!"... ...that's what they'll say in a hundred years, ..."Screwed up an entire generation, but they saved the world!" ;)

I'm not sure where to start with the Tour SiN Europa `98 gig... ...I guess I need to honorably mention Dublin and it's fine people.  My first encouter was early Tuesday morning before we had to gear-up at the castle... ...did I mention the castle?  Way, way cool 13th century estate (although this one had all the peripets and cranulations, castles usually didn't have ground-level windows, me thinks) with acres and acres of land that ActiVision rented for the entire week.  We promo'ed the up-n-comings inside and were catered to by "the staff".  Most of the estate was ancient... ...doors with handles at knee-height, hidden passageways, creeking wooden floors with hand-wrought nails... ...we're talking old and authentic. I walked down some paths that must have been traversed some centuries ago in much their same state... ...dark, gray, moss-covered, and damp.  I was indeed home ;)

Oh, sorry, back to Dublin.  My first real chance to see the city was early Tuesday morning before most stores were even open.  What a place... ...the merchants not only sweep the sidewalk outside their store, they also mop it.  The smell of the sea air was think as the droplet-sized dew caused pinpoint sensations on my face.  The cawing of the seagulls and the crowing of the... ...the crows ;)  It was marvelous and I'm getting all teary-eyed just remembering it all... ...hang on, ...okay, ...there, okay...

I've traveled a bit in my time, and I'm always amazed at how much things are different, and how much they're the same.  Soda and cigerettes for instance... ...they change completely even traveling from England to Ireland.  Especially the diet sodas with their extra localized additives.  Yes, yes, I smoked while I was there!  You almost have to as EVERYONE seems to smoke there.  Truly, and they smoke everywhere.  Some of you will remember the joys of eating in a restaurant with smoker EVERYWHERE, ...not just in their own little section.  Smoking in the grocery stores, smoking in just about every enclosed area you can imagine.  Women in labor puffing away!  I mean everyone!  ...then they start to drink and even the stoutest of health freaks soon bends under the social pressure.  My eyes would ache in excrusiating pain by the end of an evening in the pubs.  ...ah, the memories ;)  ...the smokes are gone again, BTW, ...it was just a "do as the Celtic do when in Kilts" kinda thing.

Well, I've survived Tour SiN Europa `98 and the jetlag is starting to slip away.  I had an incredible time in one of my newest 'favorite spots' called Dublin, Ireland.  You'll not find a friendlier people or a more beautiful city.  It could be the influence of distance Irish genes talking, but I highly recommend that everyone take this place if they get the chance.

I was going to make this a one-entry finger, but the rough draft is already three pages long.  So we'll do this sections.  It's all worthy reading, some rivaling even Dick's antics to include "Elexis and The Flustered Bag Piper", "The 'Foreign Shits!' Girl", and finally, "A Night at Madam Jo-Jo's".

The main point to all this is to give ActiVision a high "Hat's off!" for an incredible pre-launching.  Every want was fulfilled and every detail was attended.  A special thanks goes to all the people, from the lofty Bob 'Tomorrow the worrrrld!' Dewar to the lowest of minions... ...no, wait, ...that would be the Levelord, ...well, anyways, excellent job to all of you (Janine 'Please stop the ride, I want to get off!' Johnson, John Burns, Chris 'My god, it's actually happening!' Lewis, Sara "If you call me 'Sarah' once more I'll bite your leg off!' Pelton, Nick Segger, Ben LeRougetal, Sarah Ricchauti, Simon 'Screw the stiff upper lip!' Jones, Michele "It's NOT a girl's name!' Marchand, Alex Cook, Alison Gould, Steve Brown, and finally as in the ultimate, not lastly... ...Sandi 'These pubs are so cool!' Isaacs.

You know... ...it's all relative!  The Harry Miller and I were walking to get coffee this morning and chatting about the state of affairs.  I was starting to get really tense, what with our next game nearing it's end and a million loose ends and demo's due and people being baboons and... ...and... ...and then I looked down to see a cricket with only three legs left and its head barely attached to its body, squirming and cripply careening around in a fruitless effort to escape being poked and prodded by a half dozen pigeons and... ...well, you know.

Haven't fingered for a while, but this is a real drag that shouldn't happen... ...anyone that bad mouths a decent person such as Joe Siegler should be taken out and Jaspered!  Anyone that posts shit like that should be Jaspered as well.

...I'm trying to... ...BZZZZZ....  ....tap in... ...ZAP... ...Ouch!  ...I'm trying... ...Hello? ...Shees, just one more wire and... ...there we go!  Readers, I'm reporting from Cell #17, Block #57.  They only gave me one phone call and that was to Mom... ...I've managed to... ...to splice into a phone wire running along... ...along the vent and... ....BZZZZZ, ZAP, ...Shit, that hurts!  ...Well, anyways, I'm here and alive... ...and in the office!

The bust was a horrible, horrible joke and the linching party is directed to One Thumb's house for the #6 Dance tonight.  Seriously, we didn't think anyone would notice, or care, but here's the real scope... ...yesterday afternoon a real bust happened just outside our office.  There were a half dozen municiples and some federal-looking folks as well.  They had pulled over a big, red pick up with two huge wodden crates in the back.  As the bust progressed, we ended up seeing that the crates were filled with what looked like 2-kilo bricks of herb.  One of the officers hopped up on the truck and started pointing as he counted... ...we figure 20-30 of these bricks in just one crate.  Big time bust.  Anyways, the Digitally Challenged One got some photos and as we were looking at them, Giggle Me This said "Hey!  Doesn't that look like Richard from the back?"  ...you can figure the rest.

I feel like Orson Wells here.  Truly sorry if anyone was dupped, but please always consider the source when you hear stories like that... ...what do you think MacAskill means in Gaelic, anyways!

Talk about dedication!  I just got in... ...it's 4:30am, BTW, ...and the place is like some sick summer camp with Ritualites and their kin designing and sleeping on bean bag chairs and... ...Hey! ...what are you two doing!?  Stop that or take it home!   ...Okay, sorry, ...Jim's here and been so for 17 hours, Tom's here and been so for... ...what's two weeks straight in hours?  ...Madame Kill Creek is sleeping at his feet in blind puppy dog devotion.  Matt and Charlie are here... ...red-eyed and mushy-tailed.  The dedication is quite impressive and I think, ...I think, ...I think I'm getting all misty...

Well there's a fine mess of things related to a recent article I did for Computer Gaming World's June issue... ...somehow, the rough draft that I sent to them wound up in the hands of their British couterpart's webpage (GameSpot, UK) and was posted.  I haven't been this embarrassed in a long while!  I don't know who screwed up, but I am terrifically pissed at whoever you are!  Please know, all of you who've already read this abortion and think I'm a blithering idiot, that it was only a rough draft used to get the attention of CGW.  The grammer is broken, there's no structure or flow, it sounds like I'm ranting after a night's binge drinking, and I don't spell "color" with an "our".  This was NEVER meant for public eyes and I apologize for sounding like a complete fool.  

The final article, BTW, in the printed June issue... ...page 112, in casr your looking for it right now,  ...is worthy reading.  It reveals such secrets as Minimalism, optical illusions, the occipital cortex's rendering processes, and even Ikebana as they relate to level designing.  I am, in fact, a blithering idiot, but I can write so please do read this version ;)

Be warned... ...there's an "interview" up on DEATHMATCH.ORG and it's not the typical "So, how does one get in the gaming industry?" kinda interview.  Man, I miss Janitor Bob and The New Vore Times!  There's also a screen shot of a new deathmatch level HIPDM2 "Further Down The Oblivion" but it was only meant to piss off Nort.

Came across an interesting Trivia Question as I wrapped up my morning's session of wake-the-fuck-up music... ...what do the following albums have in common... NIN's "Pretty Hate Machine", Megadeth's "Cryptic Writings", Stone Temple Pilot's "Core", AC/DC's "Power Outage", Nuclear Assault's "Game Over", and Twisted Sister's "Under The Blade"?

"The Levelord Drinking Game"?  Okay, I'm in ;)  I bet we could make a pretty penny with the travel version.  Seriously, you're a funny man, Joe... ...that's why I keeel you laaaast!... ...just in case any are taking this seriously, Master Siegler and I meet at the Outback Steakhouse in Mesquite every few months.  He goes for the Bloomin' Onions and I... ...well, let's just say I get very pedophilic with all the high school waitresses and their short, short little skirts showing just a hint of flowery panties underneath and their amply round melon-sized boobs bouncing up and... ...or dear, ...that's two drinks for me!

While I got some of you here... ...is anyone else truly heart broken hearing the The Springer Show may in fact be Jerry Rigged?  Who can you trust anymore!

...they don't kill him, errr, CALL him One Thumb for nothing.  Don't I feel fucking stupid, too.  The very HIPDM1 page I was looking for was the Bash Norton page.  I need more drugs!
