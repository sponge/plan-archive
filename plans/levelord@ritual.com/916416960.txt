Shopping on Figuroa... ...I was reminded of another story Dick told me a bit ago, and since there's so much free time lately, I thought I'd share it.  This one took place back in 1986 while he and a childhood friend of his were living in Los Angeles.  

Dick was going to school to get a cool engineering degree and his friend, Deter, had just recently moved to LA to take a new engineering job.  This is important because it explains why neither could afford any substantial amount of Californian Salad and had to make weekly trips downtown for their quick, tin foil-wrapped refills.

Shopping on Figueroa was usually pretty cool and easy... ...slide up curbside in the auto, wave a hand, and three or more Entrepreneuritos would rush up and trade a small clump of tin-foiled wacky weed in exchange for a mere $10.  However, this one trip, and their last to Figueroa, would prove much more exciting.

Deter was a fairly big dude and was in fairly good shape.  He was also raised in a meager Irish Catholic household with six other siblings.  Translation... ...Deter was not afraid of too much that met him, to the point of being senseless sometimes.

Instead of the usual drive-in service, this last visit to Figueroa started with Deter having to actually get out of the car and walk to the dilapidated building housing the street vendors.  Dick, BTW, was driving his father's fairly new car, as his own Nova had recently blow-up, literally.  Deter proceeding to the house, about 1/2 a block up the street from where Dick was parked.

Dick, anticipating a wait, turned on the radio and kicked back with a mule.  No sooner had he lit his cigarette than Deter came running by the car at full speed yelling "Dick! Dick! Get going!  Now!!!".  Directly behind Deter followed four homies and they were gaining on Deter fast.

Dick, thinking quickly as any good Dick will do, jammed the ignition and floored the Buick out and into the street.  He needed a quick 180 and fortunately there was an empty lot just ahead unfortunately, Figueroa was a one way street.  No matter, when a friend is in as much need as Deter seemed to be the adrenaline rushed and Dick pulled into the lot to set up for his daring rescue.  Thanking god that American cars still had read wheel drive, he fish tailed a beautiful half-doughnut, spewing dust and dirt into a big feather-shaped cloud, and got back onto Figueroa in less than a second.  Figueroa was, again thanking all deities, fairly empty of what would be oncoming traffic.

Starksy and Hutching it a block down to Olympic, Dick re-entered correct traffic and he soon caught up to Deter.  The Chinos were fast on him and Deter's left sneaker flew off his foot just as Dick caught up to him.  The Homies were a mere few feet behind Deter by this time.  Dick reached over, frantically opened the passenger door, and yelled for Deter's attention.  Still going a good 5 mph, Deter leaped into the car and Dick floored it to safety.

It turns out that this whole ordeal was because Deter didn't like the visual quality of the Salad he had bought and wanted his $10 back.  After asking for the refund and being refused, laughed at, actually, he evidently just grabbed the 10 spot from the net stocking-headed hood and ran.  Ten bucks and a clump of horse weed... ...Dick risks his dad's Buick through a half dozen near misses, Deter his very flesh and blood... ...and all for a meager ten bucks!  Not much of a story, I know, but a message just the same Drugs are badddd, mmmmkay?!

1999!  ...I get the feeling this is going to be a bad year, ...very bad indeed.

In case anyone will be in the area, I'm heading for the Great White North on the last weekend in February for the GamesCon Extravagancy (http://www.gamescon.com/page.cfm).  They've asked me to talk about level designing or some shit, but I told them it would be better if I shared my experiences with submarine hunting in the Cold War or cultivating Californian Salad in cold New England.

I can't just leave you with that, though, so here's a little pre-Levelord story.  It's from a time long ago, before I saw the light and became a level designer,  I was a bit jockey, actually.  I am reminded of this story because I just replaced the old `89 Yoter van with a brand new `99 one.  A little tear of times-gone-by welled in my eye as I looked in my new rearview mirror at that old, decrepit van in the used car lot.   What a great car slammed at 50+ mph into two highway embankments and starts right back up again, three oil changes in 81K miles of driving, 1
