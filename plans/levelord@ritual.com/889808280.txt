Is it really Dallas, or is it just me?  You know how you become sensitive to certain things once you become aware of them... ...like you buy a new red Suburban and all of a sudden that's al you seem to see... ...red Suburbans, ...or you hear the name Rubenowitz for the first time and then all of a sudden you hear of a dozen other Rubenowitzs?  ...Rubenowitzii? ...whatever.  Anyways, it seems that every time I hear of some fruitcake person or wacko (sounds like Waco) event... ...it's in Dallas.  For instance, I watch The Daily Show and they have a section called "God's Stuff" in which the do short exposes on religious nuts.  Last night they did a half dozen or so and, yes, most of them seemed to hail from right here down yonder way.  Great show, BTW, and does anyone else think Craig Kilborn is a clone for Doug Wood (Valve artist, did a little Duking, too)?
