I am now doing the updates on my web page so that I can include 
pictures and cool stuff.  I post a little something here so you'll 
know when to go there.  Hope that doesn't piss you off ;)

Wanted!  Level designers!

I know it's hard to resist, but PLEASE don't email me unless you are absolutely sure you meet the follow criteria:

We need a few level designers and we need them yesterday.  These level designers must know our scripting language and be absolute gods with geometry and lighting.  Although we can bend on this, we would prefer American citizens.

We all know the industry has recently taken a few torpedoes and that there are talented people out there floating adrift aimlessly.  If you are one of those and want to come aboard the U.S.S. Ritual, please email me ASAP.

As per Mike "I'm A god, not THE god!" Wilson fingered already, I too got an email from Eric about Serious Sam!  ...you know shit is shaking when you get an email from Eric!  Anyways, I understand that Serious Sam is selling quicker than shit slips through a goose, so go get your copy like NOW!

Great job, CroBoys!  ...thanks for making us all look like terds!  ... ;)

No page updates for a little while as BaDmAn Industries is reporting that one of their corporate planes was hit by a chuck of Russian space debris.  No word as to whether Herr BaDmAn himself was on board, but he is now 3-days late here in Dallas.

Fuck it, ...I'll go to E3!  ...but just for the hell of it!  Also, why game developers never answer email or open their ICQ.

Sent in by Mister Lister, this mock-up screenshot looks incredibly similar to my living room! Incredible!

Speaking of my living room, I was reminded of something last night that I'd like to share with you. Every 3-4 months, buy a VHS tape and record whatever you watch on television one night. Record the shows, the commercials, the channel surfing, and the TV Guide channel. Then store the tape away.

I was watching a tape of Seinfeld last night that I recorded in Connecticut in 1993. It happened to be the night a huge NorEaster (big winter storm in New England) was rolling and the tape propelled me back to that night, ...the child-like thrill of being snowed-in and not having to go to work. A hot cup of coffee in the morning and a game of DOOM, ...if the power was on. What a great night, and the tape captured it all. 

One more bit of suggestion, ...Buy stocks, and buy them now! When the blood is running in the streets! Five years from now you will not believe the price you paid for them now ;)

All you Safety Device are belong to us!  

I just got one of those electronicalacious BB guns from Airsoft.  Way cool toy, but I just have to make fun of the instruction sheet.  In case you can't read the inset picture, it says, and I quote, ..."SHOULD BE ON SAFE DEVICE IF DNO'T PRESS THE TRIGGER DON'T PRESS THE TRIGGER IF NO GETTING RID OF SAFETY DEVICE" ...ha, ha, ha!

Related, why is it that most all foreigners have a cool accent when they speak American.  We can make fun of the grammer, perhaps, but the sound is almost always cool?  Contrarily, why is that the American accent is always so uncool?  I can't think of a language in which our accent sounds anything other than stumbling and clumsy and guttery.  Weird!

I start my Russian classes next week.  I can't wait to meet my Moscovian friends at E3 this year.  Now I will know what Serge, Alexei, and Dmitri will be talking about when they say things like "Eto Levelord? Da on vigladit kak kakoy-to stariy hrich!" and "Ya dumayu on piet vodki bolshe, chem Yeltsin!".

I'm not going to post it here, too fucking bad!  ...but if you're willing to hit the page, I have an interview with the Incredible AntiELVIS of www.gracelessland.com.  Here's the Introduction to entice you...

Graceless Jeopardy!
Well, as is so typical with an evil genius like the AntiElvis, we have a strange twist on the interview scene.  First, this is even more of an honor than being granted time with the Illustrious Blue, ...this is an interview with the Master of Gracelessland Inc.  Second, instead of me asking the questions and then him answering, he has provided the answers before I even did the interrogation.

Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!   I am NOT the enemy!  I am the #1 Stovatelj!

[screen shot]

Related to shooting game developers, here's an interesting situation that only proves what I have been saying since 1994, ..."Level designers will RULE the world!".  Let's look at Ritual, for instance.  We started with six owners: two programmers (Mark Dochtermann and Jim Dose'), two artists (Robert Atkins and Michael Hadwin), and two level designers (Levelord and some other guy).  This, as a mere but none-the-less strangely proportioned coincidence, is an even representation of the three main disciplines of the shooter game developer community.

Let's look at Ritual now.  Two programmers gone, Mark and Jim!  One artist gone, Michael!  It's down to ParadoX and the Levelord.  We figure we'll have the AnarChrist muscled out within another week or three, ...after the arsenic has had time to build to a sufficient level.

[picture of me and "some other guy"]

...remember, ...level designers will RULE the world!

Okay, here ya go.  Here's the text, but the REALLY funny shit is over on THE page ;)

The love doesn't get any thicker or any more stickii than it does here at His Lo-ness, Inc.. Again we see the need to support the community that gives us so much and again we step up to the plate (that's a phrase from our beloved baseball, for all you confused Europeans and people from Vermont who are NOT Japanese). As per yesterday's request on sHackNews ["Save a Shack", Tuesday, March 6, 2001], we wanted Mr. Gibson to know that the check is in the mail!

Blue's News, the Sopranos, and the Mob, ...and, ...Blue's News, the Sopranos, and the Mob!

Are we pissing off people?  I'm getting hate emails like I was A****n C*****k or George Broussard or something!  Are the updates on www.levelord.com, instead of right here, a pain in the ass?  Like I said, I moved over there so I could include pictures and hyper-techno stuff like that.  It's not like I'm looking for hits for advertisers or something.  I could always post the text here AND there, but that seems weird.

Anyways, I have actually scored an interview with Master Blue!  No shit!  If this doesn't PROVE that I am the most elite (that's "133t3st" for you non-llamas), then nothing will!  Go read it!
