My ears will melt, and then my eyes!  Blue Oyster Cult was certainly awesome last night and I highly recommend anyone of ripened years... ...Blue, ...neigh! ...young and old alike, to go see these bastards when they swing through the neighborhood.  They played a few songs from their new "Heaven Forbid" album, ...errrr, ...CD, but even better, they played more than an hour of their truly great favorites from albums, ...errr, ...CDs past.  Very cool show, very cool indeed!

The best part was getting the chance to see the boys backstage.  It's a strange mixture of feelings, meeting celebrities, in that I'm always sort of let down to find that they are only mortals like myself, yet I'm also very pleased to find that they are just regular people doing cool shit.  Some celebs are so taken by themselves that meeting them can be a real drag.  Cracking a Corona with the likes of Eric Bloom, however, was just plain awesome!

It turns out that the c|net SiN thing was on a show called TV.com which airs on ABC on early Saturday and Sunday mornings.  I didn't even know about this show and thought it would be on one of their other four shows on the Sci-Fi/USA networks.  Sorry for the confusion...

My FAKKing kinsmen and I will be blessed with guest passes to Blue Oyster Cult's concert this Wednesday night.  I'm especially psyched, having been a devote fan since 1973.  

I still remember the first time I saw Blue Oyster Cult in concert in 1974.  They were playing with Kiss and some other warm-up group in Lockhaven, Pennsylvania.  We drove down from State College in Steve Grenoble's car.  Beyond the normal entertainment of loading up a car with high school stoners and heading of for a far-away concert... ...on a week night...  ...we had the added thrill of Steve's car.  

The car had no brakes, either regular or emergency, and he had to downshift to get the car to stop.  A complete stop required an engine cut-off as first gear cranked to its fianl rotations.  For the unanticipated stops, like a train (no shit!), he had to throw it into reverse.

The most memorable part of the evening, though, was when we booed the warm-up band off the stage... ...right off the stage, we did, ...song #3 and they gave up.  I feel bad now, knowing the embarrassment and anger they must have felt, but we were there to hear *rock* groups like BOC and Kiss... ...not some falsetto, faggetty singing trio like this warm-up group.

...the warm-up group was called Rush, BTW,  ...little did we know ;)

A few last Irish tidbits before it's all lost and forgotten.  What a sad thought... ...Ireland was so cool and, again, I highly recommend it to any and all travellers!  

Anyhow, a few Irish Enigmas... ...(1) I haven't seen so many people eating so much fatty food in 20 years, yet noone seemed to be overweight.  Not like we get here, at least.  Three kinds of meat with their eggs in the morning, lunchs that would fill me for three meals, and dinners that were even larger.  (2) I've never seen so many people drink so heavily and so long into the night, and still get up early and chipper in the morning.  (3) Finally, I wonder how long it takes them to learn to drive on the wrong side of the road.

A quick bit of humor to-boot... ...the "Foreign Shits!" Girl.  The lasy night that we partied with the press found us all back at the hotel waiting for the residents bar to open.  Strange set-up over there in that there are different types of bars... ...some that close at 11pm, others that can stay open till 3am, others, ...well, they wouldn't let me in those others.  

Anyhow, it was about 11pm and we were all sitting in the lounge of the hotel.  The lounge was large and filled with plush couches.  I was sitting in one couch next to a Belgium dude, and across from us in another couch sat a French girl (names withheld 'just in case';).  We were talking about the cool ActiVision fireworks at Lutterstown Castle and the Four Horsemen and all, when all of a sudden this girl comes stumbling in.  Her swagger was so exaggerated that I thought she must be putting us on.  She wasn't!  She swaggers over and barely flops into the couch next to the French girl.  Her eyes were rolling and her head was swaying and she was trying to say something as she slowly started to pass out on the French girl's shoulder.  Well, the French girl asked if she could help in any way... ...with an obvious French accent.  The stupored girl awakened immediately, looked over at me, then the Belgian, and finally the French girl and said "Fucking foreign shits!".  There was the loose lower lip and drool that comes with any intoxicated yelling, BTW.  The three of us looked at each other in complete amazement as the drunk teetered her way to a stand and yelled once more... ..."Fucking foreign shits!"  She had a think English accent, BTW ;)  She then stumbled towards the elevator, tried to scale the waste-high banaster between her and the elevator, only to fall into the arms of two hotel personnel.  Quite amusing it was, although it looses some of its flair in the re-write...

Time is such a precious commodity right now... ...there's so much to tell about Elexis and Ireland and Elexis and... ...here's a quickie for you at least... ...it's called, ..."Elexis and the Bag Piper".

The last night of the castle gig was extra special.  ActuVision hired two bag pipers to stand out front and great us as we returned to the castle for dinner.  It was quite impressive... ...being in Ireland, two pipers playing against the backdrop of a 13th century castle.  I didn't know whether I wanted to cry or go off to fight a war.  Bag pipes always make me all goose pimply ;)

Anyhow, after about 15 minutes, everyone had filtered in where the alcohol was... ...of course.  I was more in tune to listening to the pipers and catching a lonely smoke outside.  Within a minute, my dear Elexis showed up to join me... ...in a fag, ...err, cigarette ;)  She leared and stared at one of the pipers and she puffed long and slow on her cigarette.  He kept doing that quick shift of the eyes and then almost immediately pop them back forward again.  He was obviously very flustered.

Well, our girl wasn't satisfied with this alone so she meandered over the piper and give him one of her slaps on the shoulder and a "Naughty boy!".  That was it... ...the pipes went squelch and he dropped them to the floor.  He was NOT amused and gave Elexis a very dirty look.  She scuffed and returned to her creator, ... errr, me.  After a few more drags of her smoke she went off for the drinks.  I asked the piper if he was really upset and with a look of ice he said "Yessss!  Dunny everrr doo that agin! ...everrr".

As pointed out in numerous emails... ...the castle's name was Lutterstown Castle, a name that seemed to baffle the Yankee tongue at first, but one that by week's end rolled off the tongue with the litest lilt.  Speaking of lilts, Ireland has a strange of rubbing off, or infecting maybe, all those that visit.  Most of us had picked up a detectable Irish flair to our accent within a few short days.  Maybe it's the water ;)

Okay, okay... ...on to the center ring and the star of our show... ...the Wicked Elexis!  ActiVision did a superb job and hired a gorgeous model to play the role of our beloved villainesse.  Other than having a slightly softer face than our in-game version, she was perfect!  ...right down to the (although healed now) belly button peircing.  She was all real, t
