Just got back from a walkies trip to the Post Office and you know what I noticed alot of? ...little huddles of smokers sheilding themselves from the wind and rain and puffing almost frantically as they did.  The Germans, bless their demented little hearts, have a term for this... ...I can't remember it now, but it roughly translates into "gaining enjoyment from the misfortune of others".  I do love the Germans!

Related to a recent Gameslice article about SiN, I'd like to clear up a misunderstanding due to some re-wording and re-arranging in the article.  The article would have you believe that I want to kill our Apogeean competition exclusively.  No, no, no... ...everyone knows that I want to kill ALL our competition!

Speaking of killing, I've done alot of thinking about my recent blast against Clinically Hussein.  I must admit, and thanks for all the email, that maybe I was a bit harsh and, you know, even ignorant.  Maybe I was being a Dick with the nic fits and all.  Maybe we should just let him do his thing in his country and stop using this fruitcake as some projected "bad guy" for U.S. world posturing.  Maybe we...

...Na!  Fuck that and fuck him!  ...Send over a Tomahawk, Bill!

Seems kinda quiet, so maybe we should share a Dick story?  This is one  that happened just a bit ago, but enough time has passed to protect any guilty parties.  In fact, the very location itself is no longer where it was.

Dick had been out entertaining this night with one of his work cohorts and some visiting dignitaries of the reporter type.  We'll call the cohort "Furry" and the dignitaries... ...well, they shall remain complete anominous.  It came time to close the bars, ...errrr, restaurants,  and time to go home.  After dropping off the dignitaries, Dick found himself following Furry home on Route 57.

Route 57 is under major recontruction and it has been a real mess for more than a few years.  Actually, according to Dick, negotiating 57 is alot like riding a life-sized Hot Wheels track... ...barely two lanes in either direction, bordered by those moveable 3-foot high cement embankments, and an ever-varying assortment of curves and blind dips as they shift the barriers almost daily.

Furry had recently bought a new used sport car, and he and Dick were now jockying for the pole position to the last exit before home.  Furry was in the lead and looked to be a cinch to the exit ramp.  Dick, however, would be damned if he was going to let Furry's Japanese piece-of-shit beat his classic Toyota Van so he barrelled a full head of steam from his 1 1/2 cylinders and gunned it for the exit... ...swooshing first left, then passing Furry, then careening back to the right just in time to hit the exit.  Again, keep in mind, that the exits change their configuration often, and that it was late, and that Dick was letting his ego get the best of him.

...Anyhow, that's exactly what Dick did... ...he hit the exit, ...BOOM!  55mph in a 25mph exit ramp and he slammed square into the left-most barricade.  A brief moment of silence as Dick and his airborn van flew though 50ft of air and... ...BOOM!  ...he and the Yoter broad-sided the right-most barrier!  Having next come to a oscillating rest, Furry pulled up to look for gibs... ...he figured Dick was a goner after a collision of this caliber.  

Fortunately for us all, it wasn't the end of Dick, or even the Yoter, which started right up again.  It was quite amazing, in fact, as the Yoter seemed to have sustained very little damage other than a few small scraps and a slight distortion of the right side.  Dick says that other than the sound of wind rushing in the passenger's door when he drives faster than 10mph, there's hardly a noticable difference!  ...well, the power steering is evidently out now, too, but that could be mere coincidence.

Bottom line, and you know this already... ...don't be a Dick!

...Well, it's early Sunday morning, got the stereo blasting away, freshing toasted (toast is so much more crisp when your lungs aren't coated with tobacco smoke;), and cranking on some levels in our new office space.  This is way cool, apart from the new space being "new", we were crammed like Bismarck Herrings in the old office.  I even have enough room to crack my 16-foot bullwhip!  ...hey, man, ...it's Texas, ...live it, ...love it!

Speaking of stereos blasting, I've got MegaDeath's latest blaring (ya, ya, it's a 97 release, but remember how old and slow I am!) and just noticed the title of the 7th track... ...Sin!  Yes boys, play it loud please!  MegaDeath will ALWAYS remind me of 18-hour stretches of Duke leveling and Allen The Third Blum playing "Youthanasia" thirteen times in a row... ...bless his demented little heart.  Dave Mustaine... ...hmmmm, you don't supposed, do you, that Tom has an alter profession like that sCary Spice bitch (how ya doin' BTW, Steve)?

Mr. Reagan where are you when we need you!  This Iraqathon has to stop... ...`cause I know who's paying for it come April.  "Any act of force could result in a world war!"... ...yadda, yadda, yadda, and fuck you very much Yeltsin!  We weren't afraid of you when you WERE a world power, who the fuck cares now.  Let's remember all this, too, when it comes time to subsidize your next twelve grain failures, you fuck!  Why, oh why are we dicking with this god damned Hussein anyway?  Didn't we kick his ass just a bit ago... ...and now we're playing palace shell games with the bastard?  He must go home every single night and laugh his ass off at our expense... ...*my* expense!  A simple "You cross this line in the sand, you die!" threat from Kadafi and beloved Mr. Reagan had three Tomahawks heading for ol' Momar's livingroom... ...never heard from that fruitcake again, did we.   ...could be just the nic fit talking here, but I sure don't get any of this shit!

Speaking of nic fits... ...thanks for all the cool email related to certain forgotten habits ;)  It seems quite a few Quakers have given up the cancer sticks recently... ...must be all the press recently about Mr. Reynolds and his friends.  It really is amazing, the changes you go through so quickly as an ex-smoker.  In one short week, I've already put on 10 pounds without changing any eating or exercise habits.  Nicotene ramps up your metabolism that much!  The weight doesn't bother me... ...I can loose that much more quickly than regenerate new avioli (love ya, Zoe!).  I also fall asleep, and often do, at the drop of a hat now.  When I opened the patio door last night, I was truly floored at how nice the air smelled... ...I mean it was heavenly!  Yesterday, a filthy stench-ridden smoker (adopting the new "way") passed me in the hallway and I almost puked at the pugnant reeking that followed him.  Anyhow, again, thanks so much for all the cool words everyone sent!

00:03:45 CST... ...tick, tock, ...tick, tock, ...well, tick, ...in 17 hours and 57 minutes (not that we're counting, ...much), tock, ...it will have been a week that our lord put down the evil, wicked cancer sticks.  For any of you out there still foolish enough to think you want to start this lovely habit... ...DON'T!  It's a monkey you'll never get off your back and it's the most insidious, unforgiving, relentless addiction in the world, ...and I've had a few of the more 'serious' ones to know what I'm saying, ...ya know what I'm sayin'?  

This will be the fourth time I quit smoking, ...er, cigarettes, and hopefully it will be the last.  I've quit three times before, once for two years in 1977, again in 1981 for three years, and then once more in 1988 for five years.  That's right, five fricken years and I still thought about the little bastards at least once a week until a few too many beers convinced me that I could have just *one* smoke one Frinight... ...and I did have that one smoke, ...then two the next weekend, ...and so on until within one short month, I was back to a pack a day.

The Birdman and a Golden Toothbrush... ...if you're wondering what spurred this recent wrestling with the cold tobacco turkey... ...it was a Birdman and a Golden Toothbrush.  I was channel surfing last Monnight when I happened on one of those medical shows.  This one had a middle-aged dude chirping through one of those voice boxes, breathing through a permanent trachial tube, and warning about the hazards of smoking... ...he had all of his lower jaw, tongue, larynx, and upper trachia removed... ...he looked like some horrific bird with the only prominant feature left on his face being his nose.  It's strange, although they're excruciatingly painful ways to die, the thoughts of lung cancer and heart disease never really enter my mind.  However, the thought of becoming an unsightly, grotesque remnant of some otomist's scalpel snapped me straight up... ...we really are a self-conscious lot, aren't we o' lord.  

The toothbrush is what set the real stage, though.  For whatever strange connections that have been linked in my head, ...actually, it's probably from Dr. Frank Pasenelli who used to drill my three-to-six-cavities-per-year *without* novacaine when I was a kid (weak gene pool and too much candy), ...whenever I dream about my teeth, it's usually related to my general health because teeth were my first encounter with real medical intervension.  Anyhow, that very same night that I saw this medical show, I also dreamed about three golden toothbrushes.  I remember thinking "Cool, I still have three left." as I opened my bathroom drawer.  I always buy blue toothbrushes, BTW, ...see the connection?

Sad news indeed... ...not many of you knew him, but he was a hell of a guy.  Dennis Scarff has passed away ;(  I knew him at Apogee and, although I only shared smoke breaks with him throughout the year, I really was heartbroken to hear that he's gone.  Those of us that knew you, sir, were more than pleased to ride with you!

Okay, on to brighter things.  The Tribe of Ritual is surely the humblest and never do they sing their own praises or sit on any thorny laurels.  However, I'd like to thank the incredibly sightful people at Computer Gaming World for naming "The Scourge of Armagon" as the Best Add-on Pack of 1997 (March 1998 issue, pg 89).  There's even a bit about "arguably the best deathmatch level." or something like that ;)

Mr. Superstar Wieder (please see his .plan, if you haven't)!  We don't often get recognized by the female counterpart so it's a rare and charished event when we do ;)  The Levelord has a similar story, although it crashes hard at the end... ...he was in an Arby's a few months ago, waiting in line for a dilectable, fat-laiden "roast beef" (a mere vehicle for the Arby's Sauce, actually), when a beautiful blonde in the adjacent line recognized me.  She remembered me from the Duke Nukem CD.  She quite a piece... ...professionally dressed (always a plus `cause it usually means she's got *some* money), golden blonde hair, very nice figure, and SHE was the one that started-up the conversation.  Well, don't `cha know our lord immeditely ran out to his classic van and grabbed a copy of Duke for the lass... ...even giving up his place in line to do so.  When he returns, the gamerette was already sitted.  With the urbanity of a true swashbuckler, he hands het the CD and she responds... ..."Oh!  Thank you!  My husband LOVES this game!"  Nose-dive city, ...few survivors expected!

While we're here... ...Giggler cute?!?  If the Rolling Wieder's groupie knew he requires 16 AAA batteries each day, she'd sing a different tune, me thinks!  He does say "Mutha"" when you push in his stomach, though, and that's a plus I guess.

God bless American... ...especially its automobiles.  I must confess that I currently drive a Jap car.  I'm in need of a new car and have been thinking about getting a cool big American hog like a Suburban, old Nova, or even a Herse.  After the accident I saw this morning on the way to work, I'm convinced!  It was a nasty, nasty three-car pile up in which a 1980's Buick had broadsided a Corolla, which then struck another import.  The Corolla had been converted from an already cramped 6-foot interior girth to a new 2-foot.  The third car was likewise totalled by the crushed Corolla.  The Buick was sitting in what looked like its original point of contact with bearly a scratch.  It was obvious who walked away and who heard the sirens.

Related to violence, we have a new hobby at the office... ...The Jerry Springer Show!  I thought that this was just another gab-and-sob show, but I was greatly mistaking!  I stayed at home for the holiday seasons and happened to catch this show.  It is awesome... ...more beeping than actual words, coldcock crosscuts to the face, cool cat fights between women who know no rules to fighting.  One show had two women going at it for the entire show, ...punching, throwing, grabbing fistfuls of hair and not releasing as the stage hounds tried to pull them apart.  By the end of this show, they each had huge areas of scalp showing with blood oozing from the wrenched follicles. ...Way cool!

1998!  ...no way!  ...I'm still having a hard time accepting that it's almost Artist-Formerly-Not-Known-As-Prince Party Time.  Two more years, ...short years, and it will be 2000... ...no way!

Anyhow, I've had the second-most coolest thing (first being the JFK ride last week) happen to me in the past year... ..."The Worst of 1997" special on www.pcme.com!  There's a certain credit issue that just warms my heart and a "Hat's Off!" goes to Rod White for including it.   Thank you, sir!   Related... ...it's been rumored that the Quake Community is amiss that Q2 was included.  Having read the article a second time, it seems obvious enough that this was not meant as slam against the game.  Easy, kids, easy!

Actually, there's a third cool thing happening... ...someone else is doing our add-on pack for SiN.  We've been mulling over this for sometime now (deciding on the best team, time lines, etc.), but it really didn't sink in to me until today that THIS time SOMEONE else is doing a pack for me!  ...that sounds uncharacteristically egocentric and self-serving, I know, but I just never thought I'd see this day ;)

Holy sheep shit!  Wired Magazine came to shoot Paradox and me for an up-n-coming special.  They rented the limo that JFK was shot in and ran us up and down Dealy Square... ...it was very cool!  There were alot of tourists looking and gawking as they tried to see if they recognized who we were... ...they didn't... ...yet ;)

Thanks to all those related to the dead aunt, especially Ben and Darrin!  Interestingly, of the dozen or so people I told this story to here in Dallas, all the females asked the same question... ..."Did they do an autopsy?".  They did, and it was a massive heart attack.  .
