Forgot to mention the best part of that last evening's tail.  Not quite a Dick Story, but it does add the extra "real life" edge to my engagement announcement...

...Kelly and I had been in the Bath O' Betrothal for about an hour when all of a sudden a loud pounding came on my front door.  It was 2am and my first thought was "Shit, the police are here for a Cops bust and they've got the wrong place and by the time they realize it is the wrong place they will have found something to make it the right place and...", ...like I said, it was 2am and the force behind the knocking was rather strong and alarming.

I went to the door, barely covered by a towel, and found that it was only my downstairs neighbor.  I have never used the tub in my apartment, only the shower.  Evidently, when the tub is full there is enough pressure for the water to leak down through the gasket by the drain.  My neighbor now had gallons of water seeping into her bathroom.  Sure enough, when I got back, the tub was half empty of water.  Kelly and I hadn't noticed, I guess, because of all the swooning and such.

Purely personal, so don't email me, Old Man Murray, bitching about non-professional finger flipping!  If this is Brother Tim, please keep your mouth shut about this until Kelly gets home...

...the Levelord, the Good and Humble, the hater of the Dreaded "We" Pronoun, ...is officially engaged.  Poor, poor Kelly... ...induced and intoxicated amidst the romance of an enchanted evening of movies, Cosmic Cup dining, and Mr. Bubble, ...said she would spend the rest of her life with me ;)

I really have missed the "other" half, and the romance and all, the past five years.  I thought I was satisfied with being alone and free.  No "we" pronoun... ...when are "we" going out, what are "we" going to do this weekend, what are "we" going to have for dinner.  I was wrong.  I like being alone, but not lonely.  I was starting to think I'd end up like Aqualung.

I took Kelly out Wednesday night to see "The Sixth Sense".  She loves going to the movies, and especially the popcorn.  I made all the manly motions to make her feel catered and caressed... ...running around the car to open her door, holding hands at every opportunity, asking how she was enjoying the evening and if there was anything I could do more... ...the works, and it worked ;)  Remember, I'm 41 now, she's not too far behind, and we've already lived together for 5 years in the early 1980's... ...this isn't just young love ;)  

Cool, cool movie, BTW.  I was expecting more horror and scare factor, but the story and acting were very cool.  

Anyways, we then went to the Cosmic Cup for dinner.  This is a great restaurant if you're a vegetarian and especially if you're an ex-hippie.  Great atmosphere and great food.  I had been so nervous for two weeks, knowing that I was going to ask for Kelly's hand, and the movie and dinner seemed to last for days as I wallowed in anticipation.

We then returned to my, ...errrr, excuse me, ..."our" apartment for the finale.  While she watched television, thinking it was the end of a nice, simple-yet-romantic evening, I headed for the bathroom, shut the doors, and proceeded to set the trap.  Two candles, a bottle of Dom Perignon, and a tub full of Mr. Bubble.  We (caught it that time;) have an awesomely commodious Roman bath tube in our apartment... ...extra wide and long, and it comfortably fits two.

Once readied, I swang open the door that leads to the bedroom and displayed this final feather flurting.  We sat and soaked for a while and I then popped the cork of the champagne.  I filled the two glasses and cautioned Kelly NOT to taste it yet.  Reaching around behind the tub, I grabbed the heirloom (Old English for "Save the money for the house and sex toys, kids!") diamond ring and clumsily put it on her finger.  An awesome 1.6-ish carat chunk of condensed carbon, the ring was originally my matriacal Grandmother's.

I can't believe how nervous and awkward I was.  It was like being a teenager again and asking that first girl out for a date.  It wasn't until 30 minutes later that I stopped trembling and stammering.  I had placed the ring on Kelly's finger under the cover of the layer of bubbles and it took her 10 minutes just to gain the courage to lift her hand out of the water to see the ring.

Thanks again for all the cool, cool email.  I am definitely going to be down for a while.  Actually, I'm a fucking wreck trying to reconcile dad's departure and Kelly being so far away.  I do apologize for long responses and such ;(

If you want to help the Good and Humble Levelord recoup, go do the right thing and visit http://www.3dgaming.net/ and vote for the appropriate web page ;)

Anyone remember that little "Guess Who's in the Photo" thing on Blue's News with me and Robin Williams?  Remember how depressed and distant he looked.  His dad had just died.  Wish I had been more empathetic ;(

A sharp, swift sword is a very good thing, and it is bad one! ...just a special note for all the cool emails related to my dad's demise and an apology for not answering them all sooner.

For those that haven't heard, my dad passed away on June 15 from a sudden and severe stroke.  His death was sharp and swift!  He was at a meeting on Tuesday morning and simply collapsed at 9:30am.  Within 2 hours, he was gone.  Little pain other than the fear and little time to suffer other than a few brief, semi-conscious hours.  That's was good because strokes too often leave behind a partial survivor, crippled and suffering for many years.

It was also very bad because the departure was indeed so sudden.  My mom, dad and I (my only brother killed himself in 1980 in a fatal motorcycle/beer/telephone pole incident) have always been a very close family and, apart from my loss of weekly phone calls to tell the folks all the cool shit that happened the previous week, I feel a terrible empathetic loneliness for my mom who nows sits at home so completely alone.  43 years of sharing almost everything they did whiped completely off into the blankest blackness, just like that.  It makes me think that I would really rather have never of loved at all, for I never would have cried.

My mom and I are atheists, devote atheists, so death to us means only that the person has slipped back into the void from which they originally came.  Gone, and gone FOREVER!  Therein lies the true pain.  No happy reunion later in someplace called heaven, just gone and gone forever.  Why is that, BTW, that theists and agnostists find it easy enough to accept that they immerged from nowhere and nothingness at birth, yet they can not accept that that is where they may indeed wind up at death?

Anyways, thanks so much for all the cool emails and please give me another week or so to full recoup.

SacrÙ‰ bleu!  I have been honored as the "Link of the Day" on Blue's News?!  Momma, I'm on top of the world!  ... ;)

There's a new entry on Dick's Place(www.levelord.com/dicks/dicks.htm).  Not quite as exciting as usual because it's about me, but if you're bored, please do check `er out ;)  I don't want to get alot of emails saying "No way! ...you're making this up as you go along!" because it is true.

Thanks for all the cool emails wishing me good luck in my new found old love.  The problem is, though, that she's in New Jersey and the Levelord is here in Texas.  Also, POSSLQ stands for People of Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters.

America is one fucked-up country!  Don't get me wrong, we do some pretty cool shit over here and I truly love my home, but we are so fucking hung up on sex and nudity that it's amazing we even progenerate at all!

I just had the most wonderful 5-day vacation I've ever had, and now I'm reminded of the American priggish prudeness.  An old girl friend came to visit.  Actually, Kelly Ann is a POSSLQ that I spent alot of time with and had alot of fun with.  Unfortunately, we had so much fun that I believe I'm in love again for the first time in a decade... ...what a drag because I thought all that shit was past me.  That's another story, though.

We spent the entire time making, ...well, making jigsaw puzzles.  You know, with the interlocking pieces and all.  We even took pictures to remember it all.  Kelly is a fun girl ;)  This is all related to America because I just found out that it's against the law for photo shops to develop any pornographic pictures.  Nudity is okay, but any touching or contact is right out.  They'll develop a decapitation auto accident or murder, but any contact between to loving adults is simply not allowed.  How fucked-up is that?!

This hits so close game development because we want so badly to put nudity and soft-porn in our games but do not for fear of lossing shelf space.  We can blow-up babies and massacre crowds of innocents, but show even a nipple and we're banished.  For those of you that know what we're doing in FAKK2, please also know the tremendous risk we are taking ;)  ...and I'm moving to Europe the first chance I get!

More from E3...

"I'm going to KICK Lara Croft's ASS!" - Julie Strain, May 15, 1999.

   ...nuff said!

Once again, E3 was awesome and E3 was draining.  You develop a serious case of sensory overload from both the show and all the people coming and going.  For me, the best is meeting people you know only through email or their work.  This year, I got to finally meet the Michael Angelo of Webpages, Sir Walter Costinak.  The dude is incredibly talented, the best actually, yet so mild and down-to-earth in person.

I was bummed at not getting to meet Chris Moeller and Chuck Austen who were going to try and show up.  These are the two bent geniuses behind the Tripping the Rift AVI and I wanted to thank them in person for all the laughing they've provided our entire office.  I am also bummed at not getting to meet up with Blue.  I remember yakking with His Looniness a couple of times and Blue says that he was in fact there, saw the demo and we shot the shit for a while, but I can't remember that for the life of me.  THAT'S what has me bummed!

I think the best of all though, was hanging with Kevin Eastman and Julie Strain.  Again, two majestically talented and famous people, yet so humble.  In particular, I love the video we have of Robert The Anarchrist demonstrating FAKK2 to Kevin.  Robert of course, has this puppy dog look of awe as he turns to Kevin and, in return, Kevin shows the same look os esteem as he looks back at Rob.  Awesome, awesome, awesome.

I want to write more, but I think I'll save it for a start-up entry on levelord.com where I can include pictures and such.  Expect no reporting on "other" games, BTW, as the Good and Humble Levelord has absolutely no interest in them ;)

There's a story behind the "Name the two guys in the picture" that ran on Blue's... ...anyone care to hear it?  ...cool!  This is indeed the Good and Humble Levelord who got the chance to meet one of his heros while at UCLA.  At the time, Robin Williams and Clint Eastwood were the only two respectable Hollywood types.  What a great opportunity you might think, but alas, it was not.

I'm not sure how much of this is true, so please do not quote me, but there were reasons why Robin looked so blue at the time.  Normally a very aminated and entertaining person, he looked like this the entire afternoon.  I found out later that he was putting away the Peruvian Marching Powder, an obvious stage tool for his first ten years.  He also was being divorced by his wife after getting the Latina maid pregnant.  Even worse, his dad had just died.  Again, other than his dad's death, I don't know for sure about the other reasons, but I have never been so dissapointingly suprised as by this chance meeting.

...he did tell me one funny thing, though, that I still remember to this day.  "Richard" he said, "One Levelord beats a Paradox!"

It is with great embarrassment that I forgot to mention the "other" most hilarious web site on the net...

http://www.oldmanmurray.com/seanbaby/

...just read it if you're feeling Blue, ...no wait, ...I mean, it will make you feel up, ...I mean, like, ...when you're down.  Thanks for the head's-up, Master Stotler!

Long time, no finger ;(  I just had to reference this page because it has made me laugh more than anything else in recent years.  I highly recommend a daily visit to Old Man Murray's...

    http://www.oldmanmurray.com/default.wc

It can be brutal and down right cruel to game developers, ...hell, it slams just about anything that's not nailed down, but it's too funny to miss no matter who you are.  I risk alienation by some of my comrads per
