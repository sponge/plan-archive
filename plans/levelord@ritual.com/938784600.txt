Shit... ...here we go, New Jersey bound to pick up one pussy and three cats.  A complete change in life!  I guess the Levelord credo "No plants, no pets, no people!" is gone forever.

Rob, the Anarchrist and redilskcaB, and I were just talking about this change of life and I was reminded that I wanted to share one word with all of you... ...Albolene!  Not just for the inside, but for the outside as well.  It doesn't get sticky, it doesn't fade away even after hours, and it has no offensive taste.  Buy it, use it, and you too will know.

Oh god!  I'm going to New Jersey tomorrow to pick up Kelly.  This time she won't be leaving in two weeks.  Why didn't any of my so-called friends stop this madness!  ... ;)

Here's a bit of weird sciece for you... ...Kelly and her mom share the same birthday.  This is also the day of the year that my little brother killed himself on a motorcycle.  Makes for a real sweet-n-sour occassion for the Levelord.  Further, my dad died on June 15th this year.  Kell's dad died on the same day back in 1985.  Too weird... ...but wait, it gets even more tangled...  ...the department head at the first job I took as a COBOL programmer while living with Kelly back in the early 80's had a younger only-brother that got killed while skydiving on the same day as the head's wife's birthday.  You can't make this sort of shit up, you know.

Just have to braodcast this... ...has everyone seen the Drakan shit up on Old Man Murray's?  (http://www.oldmanmurray.com/default.wc)  ...someone finally used a Hanson Brothers reference.  Thanks for puttin' on the foil, Erik and Chet!

...even a better example than Duke, ...the movie Psycho!  ...Alfred's, that is!  Black-and-white, no special effects, not even one scene of actual ultra-violence, ...but still it's one of the best scary movies ever.

...ah!  ...this death thing REALLY sucks!  It's also strange how the mind works in parts, and how, obviously, some parts aren't always engaged.  Last night, about 5pm and just after I had talked to mom on the phone, I got a sudden rush of guilt and panic that I had forgotten my dad's birthday (Sept. 22nd).  It took a full few seconds to remember that it doesn't matter anymore ;(

I'm so tired of chasing technology!  Cutting-edge and special effects have become horrible phrases for me.  We spend so much time and effort "getting up" and not enough "going", and for an old fart like me, it just gets tiring.

Keep in mind that I've been in software since before there were floppies.  Platter "hard" drives stored a whopping 128k and programming was down on card readers and hoppers.  Anyone else remember their Hollerith code and EBCDIC?  I remember being in the Navy, dabbling in FORTRAN, and seeing the DPs carefully walking down the halls holding 8" floppies, when they first came out, like some precious serving tray.  They were afraid the bits would get jumbled if the floppies got jarred in any way.

I am so completely convinced that we could release Duke Nukem 3D right now and it would still sell as many copies and be as popular.

I just want to get stoned and watch TV!  ...make it all go away, please!

Forgot to mention the best part of that last evening's tail.  Not quite a Dick Story, but it does add the extra "real life" edge to my engagement announcement...

...Kelly and I had been in the Bath O' Betrothal for about an hour when all of a sudden a loud pounding came on my front door.  It was 2am and my first thought was "Shit, the police are here for a Cops bust and they've got the wrong place and by the time they realize it is the wrong place they will have found something to make it the right place and...", ...like I said, it was 2am and the force behind the knocking was rather strong and alarming.

I went to the door, barely covered by a towel, and found that it was only my downstairs neighbor.  I have never used the tub in my apartment, only the shower.  Evidently, when the tub is full there is enough pressure for the water to leak down through the gasket by the drain.  My neighbor now had gallons of water seeping into her bathroom.  Sure enough, when I got back, the tub was half empty of water.  Kelly and I hadn't noticed, I guess, because of all the swooning and such.

Purely personal, so don't email me, Old Man Murray, bitching about non-professional finger flipping!  If this is Brother Tim, please keep your mouth shut about this until Kelly gets home...

...the Levelord, the Good and Humble, the hater of the Dreaded "We" Pronoun, ...is officially engaged.  Poor, poor Kelly... ...induced and intoxicated amidst the romance of an enchanted evening of movies, Cosmic Cup dining, and Mr. Bubble, ...said she would spend the rest of her life with me ;)

I really have missed the "other" half, and the romance and all, the past five years.  I thought I was satisfied with being alone and free.  No "we" pronoun... ...when are "we" going out, what are "we" going to do this weekend, what are "we" going to have for dinner.  I was wrong.  I like being alone, but not lonely.  I was starting to think I'd end up like Aqualung.

I took Kelly out Wednesday night to see "The Sixth Sense".  She loves going to the movies, and especially the popcorn.  I made all the manly motions to make her feel catered and caressed... ...running around the car to open her door, holding hands at every opportunity, asking how she was enjoying the evening and if there was anything I could do more... ...the works, and it worked ;)  Remember, I'm 41 now, she's not too far behind, and we've already lived together for 5 years in the early 1980's... ...this isn't just young love ;)  

Cool, cool movie, BTW.  I was expecting more horror and scare factor, but the story and acting were very cool.  

Anyways, we then went to the Cosmic Cup for dinner.  This is a great restaurant if you're a vegetarian and especially if you're an ex-hippie.  Great atmosphere and great food.  I had been so nervous for two weeks, knowing that I was going to ask for Kelly's hand, and the movie and dinner seemed to last for days as I wallowed in anticipation.

We then returned to my, ...errrr, excuse me, ..."our" apartment for the finale.  While she watched television, thinking it was the end of a nice, simple-yet-romantic evening, I headed for the bathroom, shut the doors, and proceeded to set the trap.  Two candles, a bottle of Dom Perignon, and a tub full of Mr. Bubble.  We (caught it that time;) have an awesomely commodious Roman bath tube in our apartment... ...extra wide and long, and it comfortably fits two.

Once readied, I swang open the door that leads to the bedroom and displayed this final feather flurting.  We sat and soaked for a while and I then popped the cork of the champagne.  I filled the two glasses and cautioned Kelly NOT to taste it yet.  Reaching around behind the tub, I grabbed the heirloom (Old English for "Save the money for the house and sex toys, kids!") diamond ring and clumsily put it on her finger.  An awesome 1.6-ish carat chunk of condensed carbon, the ring was originally my matriacal Grandmother's.

I can't believe how nervous and awkward I was.  It was like being a teenager again and asking that first girl out for a date.  It wasn't until 30 minutes later that I stopped trembling and stammering.  I had placed the ring on Kelly's finger under the cover of the layer of bubbles and it took her 10 minutes just to gain the courage to lift her hand out of the water to see the ring.

Thanks again for all the cool, cool email.  I am definitely going to be down for a while.  Actually, I'm a fucking wreck trying to reconcile dad's departure and Kelly being so far away.  I do apologize for long responses and such ;(

If you want to help the Good and Humble Levelord recoup, go do the right thing and visit http://www.3dgaming.net/ and vote for the appropriate web page ;)

Anyone remember that little "Guess Who's in the Photo" thing on Blue's News with me and Robin Williams?  Remember how depressed and distant he looked.  His dad had just died.  Wish I had been more empathetic ;(

A sharp, swift sword is a very good thing, and it is bad one! ...just a special note for all the cool emails related to my dad's demise and an apology for not answering them all sooner.

For those that haven't heard, my dad passed away on June 15 from a sudden and severe stroke.  His death was sharp and swift!  He was at a meeting on Tuesday morning and simply collapsed at 9:30am.  Within 2 hours, he was gone.  Little pain other than the fear and little time to suffer other than a few brief, semi-conscious hours.  That's was good because strokes too often leave behind a partial survivor, crippled and suffering for many years.

It was also very bad because the departure was indeed so sudden.  My mom, dad and I (my only brother killed himself in 1980 in a fatal motorcycle/beer/telephone pole incident) have always been a very close family and, apart from my loss of weekly phone calls to tell the folks all the cool shit that happened the previous week, I feel a terrible empathetic loneliness for my mom who nows sits at home so completely alone.  43 years of sharing almost everything they did whiped completely off into the blankest blackness, just like that.  It makes me think that I would really rather have never of loved at all, for I never would have cried.

My mom and I are atheists, devote atheists, so death to us means only that the person has slipped back into the void from which they originally came.  Gone, and gone FOREVER!  Therein lies the true pain.  No happy reunion later in someplace called heaven, just gone and gone forever.  Why is that, BTW, that theists and agnostists find it easy enough to accept that they immerged from nowhere and nothingness at birth, yet they can not accept that that is where they may indeed wind up at death?

Anyways, thanks so much for all the cool emails and please give me another week or so to full recoup.

Sacrى bleu!  I have been honored as the "Link of the Day" on Blue's News?!  Momma, I'm on top of the world!  ... ;)

There's a new entry on Dick's Place(www.levelord.com/dicks/dicks.htm).  Not quite as exciting as usual because it's about me, but if you're bored, please do check `er out ;)  I don't want to get alot of emails saying "No way! ...you're making this up as you go along!" because it is true.

Thanks for all the cool emails wishing me good luck in my new found old love.  The problem is, though, that she's in New Jersey and the Levelord is here in Texas.  Also, POSSLQ stands for People of Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters.

America is one fucked-up country!  Don't get me wrong, we do some pretty cool shit over here and I truly love my home, but we are so fucking hung up on sex and nudity that it's amazing we even progenerate at all!

I just had the most wonderful 5-day vacation I've ever had, and now I'm reminded of the American priggish prudeness.  An old girl friend came to visit.  Actually, Kelly Ann is a POSSLQ that I spent alot of time with and had alot of fun with.  Unfortunately, we had so much fun that I believe I'm in love again for the first time in a decade... ...what a drag because I thought all that shit was past me.  That's another story, though.

We spent the entire time making, ...well, making jigsaw puzzles.  You know, with the interlocking pieces and all.  We even took pictures to remember it all.  Kelly is a fun girl ;)  This is all related to America because I just found out that it's against the law for photo shops to develop any pornographic pictures.  Nudity is okay, but any touching or contact is right out.  They'll develop a decapitation auto accident or murder, but any contact between to loving adults is simply not allowed.  How fucked-up is that?!

This hits so close game development because we want so badly to put nudity and soft-porn in our games but do not for fear of lossing shelf space.  We can blow-up babies and massacre crowds of innocents, but show even a nipple and we're banished.  For those of you that know what we're doing in FAKK2, please also know the tremendous risk we are taking ;)  ...and I'm moving to Europe the first chance I get!

Once again, E3 was awesome and E3 was draining.  You develop a serious case of sensory overload from both the show and all the people coming and going.  For me, the best is meeting people you know only through email or their work.  This year, I got to finally meet the Michael Angelo of Webpages,
