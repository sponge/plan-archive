Holy ship shit!  Wired Magazine came to shoot Paradox and me for an up-n-coming special.  They rented the limo that JFK was shot in and ran us up and down Dealy Square... ...it was very cool!  There were alot of tourists looking and gawking as they tried to see if they recognized who we were... ...they didn't... ...yet ;)

Thanks to all those related to the dead aunt, especially Ben and Darrin!  Interestingly, of the dozen or so people I told this story to here in Dallas, all the females asked the same question... ..."Did they do an autopsy?".  They did, and it was a massive heart attack.  ...no, really!

A bit of "what it's like IN the industry"... ...Rob and I were looking for the Quake II CD the other day while everyone else was out to lunch.  Everyone has the same stack of CDs piled on their desk and everyone has the same CDs in those piles... ...almost exclusively of NIN, Metallica, and Manson.  I bet we could save ALOT of cash by sharing ;)

Got an email from Scotty-Boy saying that he saw some dudes wearing SiN T-shirts at the Lords of Acid concert last night in Austin... ...very, very cool indeed.  Wide-scale advertising for the cost of $6!

Finally, and truly trivially, I rented McHale's Navy the other day and had a tickle when Binghamton first got to the island and threatened to send them all to the "...remotest island down the Aleutian chain if they didn't square away ASAP!".  That would be Adak, Alaska, where his lo-ness himself spent 13 months listening for those dirty, evil Soviet submarines.

Be careful of what you wish for... ...I have an aunt and uncle in Connecticut.  The uncle is my Dad's brother and he married a German frau while serving in the Army in the 1960's.  I think I love the German language so much because I spent alot of time with Ingrid and she practiced her American on my forgiving 5-year-old ears.  Anyhow, their marriage has seen some bad waters the past few years and it got to the point where Ingrid has been sleeping on the couch.  Evidently, Saturnight was a bad one and my uncle yelled "I wish you were dead!" as he escaped for bed.  When he and my cousin awoke on Sunday morning... ...there lay Ingrid as cold as the Connecticut morning!   Ouch! ...my uncle is really bumming, as you can imagine, and all I can think about is not being a Dick as often as I am with those around me.

sCary is!  He's all over us about sticking something in our fingers... ...god, he can be a real dick sometimes!  Just to shut him up, here's a little bit of interest, and it's kind of related to SiN, too.  

We've got this sink in our kitchen and it's one of the most disgusting, primordial soup-sess pools I've ever seen!  ...and I've lived in enough to know!  I was just washing my hands and, while going through the rinse cycle, a big chunk of some quasi-biomass belched up from the drain.  It was then followed by a small community of very naughty bits indeed.  This sink, although it's swallowed a good three bottles of Draino, just doesn't seem to want to come clean and gobs of goo are frequently swirling in it's basin and trap.   I don't know what's living down there, but it has given me some great inspiration for The Xenomorphic level I'm working on... ...disgusting!

I suppose while I've got you here, I can do a little mention of one of my favorite cities and the goofballs at Quakecast.  New York is so cool!  I really do love the smell of the subway as it breaths its death, decay, and machine oil scents up through the street grates.  It doesn't make sense, because it's a pugnant, revolting smell, actually, but I guess it's similar to how a fly loves the smell of shit... ...I do love New York.  I'm not much for walking around, but there is so much shit going on that I can easily spend eight hours just tooling around watching it all.  You can buy just about ANYTHING your sick, little heart desires and all the weird fucking fruitcakes walking around loose make for a very cool show.  Then there's the pizza, and the constant fear of death from a screaming yellow taxis... ...god, I do love that city!

The Village has some of the coolest shops!  I found an Alex (Clockwork Orange - if you haven't, you MUST see this movie!) and a Charlie Manson figurine for my desk.  I'm always worried about setting the right image when the press come to visit, you know.  I've got a good 10-year stockpile of Wallabees now, too.  Not only can I find Wallabees in New York; I can find green Wallabees ;)

Quakecast was alot of fun.  The studio is set-up quite professionally now... ...real plugged-in, techno like.  I was a bit dismayed when I first got there this time, though.  The place was all decked out Quake-like when I was there for M3, but this time, the main rooms were filled with artsy fartsy shit like some SoHo gallery... ...very chic, very chic indeed.  The Judge and Jury had me laughing hysterically and I recommend at least a quick listen of last Thursday's show.

I had an interesting flight home.  You know how airplanes usually lift straight away and steady to the cruising altitude after take-off?  Well, after only a minute or three of climbing, the plane suddenly levelled off.  I immediately thought "Cool!  ...An engine stall or we've thrown a turbine blade or something!".  Figuring we all have to go sometime, and doing so in a big, dramatic ball of flames would be an exciting way out, I usually get more excited than terrified with airplane-related 'events'.  Anyhow, I was looking out the window, back towards the engines, when all of a sudden a Leer jet zoomed by directly over us and only about 100ft above! ...even cooler! ...a near midair collision!  We were still over Connecticut and no where near New Jersey, BTW, so here again I wasn't really worried about hitting the ground ;)

An amusing little anecdote reared its head a couple of weeks ago, and since no one else seems to want to put their finger on it, ...the lord will.  It's a shame, really, that it wasn't reported more closely to its occurrence, because it's lost some of its zeal.   ...and we had photos, too!

In this story, we'll change the names again to protect the innocent.  Mike "Giggle Me This!" Wardwell's birthday happened a few weeks ago.  Not just any birthday, mind you, but his 21st.   Our little boy is all grown-up, Marge ;(  We wanted to make sure that it was a memorable birthday for him, so we took him to Baby Dolls uptown.  Besides being his birthday, it was also Friday, ...so, you know.

We went to this den of will repute and were soon being entertained by a bevy of Texan beauties.  A particularly adorable one immediately picked out our new hunter from the tribe.  There seemed to be magic in the air, ...you could smell it, and Harry "Pssst, Come Here, I've got lots of twenties..." made sure to let her know it was her target's, ...ummm, ...new friend's Cumming of Age Ritual.

Veronica!  Veronica "Play My Flute Like a Harmonica!" was truly charming, and soon we learned why Mike is called The Giggler.  It was embarrassing, actually, but hey, he's part of the kinship and we have to accept him!  I was soon to learn, though, what had him snickering so childishly.  Miss Birthday Box peeled herself from Giggler's lap and bedicked, ...ah, bedecked mine.  ...just thinking about this story has me all choked up in romance, ...anyway, no sooner had she straddled my leg did I feel this vice-grip wrenching around my thigh.  It was incredible, this girl!  Nautilus must be doing some whacked things lately.  We're talking labial pinching here, not squeezing her thighs around mine.  It was like having a horse try to peel oats from the side of my leg.  It was incredible!  She smiled a knowing smirk and was soon barnacled back on the birthday boy.

Some time passed, and some beers, and then I passed some of the beers.  When I got back, Veronica looked over at me while she slightly pulled down Giggler's shirt neck.  She was grimacing in painfully restrained hysteria as she showed me about a half a dozen of the biggest, most purpled sucker bites I have ever seen!  Any of you Trekkies or old farts remember that original Star Trek that had an alien that would suck the salt out of you and leave these horrific suction marks in the process?  ...Mike looked worse!  ...much worse!

Mrs. Giggler, the Mother of All Things Gigglish, was due in town to visit her son the very next morning, BTW.

I knew it, ...I just knew it!  There was a fire truck, sirens a' blarin' and lights a' flashin', out in front of the Ion Storm building this morning!  ...I knew all that hair was a fire hazard!

...BTW, thanks back at cha, Master Cloud ;)

The following is a story.  It is only a story and does necessarily relate to any truth or actuality.  The names have been changed to protect the innocent... ...as well as the guilty.

It seems this dude, we'll call him Dick, came to work the other day only to find that the parking lot was packed to near capacity.  Dick was running late and needed to park.  There were available spaces way at the top of the parking structure, he was sure, but there was also a nice spot still open right near the elevator.  The only problem was that this spot was being half-consumed by some fruitcake in the adjacent spot that didn't have the time to park straight and correct.  This happens alot and I'm sure you can appreciate Dick's frustration at the inconsiderable piggish parking that ruined an otherwise prime location.

Dick drives a van and exiting his vehicle from either side is quite convenient for him.  With that in mind, he inched his car into the 2/3 slot, thus blocking the driver's door of the offensive bastard one over.  Two birds with one stone Dick thought...a cool parking spot AND a little "Consider this, asshole!" to-boot.

As many of these things do, the situation escalated.  When Dick was leaving at the end of the day, he noticed a hand-written note on his windshield stating something to the effect of "You blocked me out of my car, you hit my right front bumber in doing so, I've taken down your liscense number, and I've filed a police report."  The twit even added a report number which, we figure, was to make Dick really sweat over his foul deed.

Well, Dick didn't hit the bumber, but he did sweat about the note.  He figured the best thing to do was to likewise take down the other person's liscense... ...which he did.  The next morning, at spying the hog dog's car again, he took down their liscense... ...I mean he took down their liscense! ...right off the back of the car!  Dick hopes that the police will be filing another report soon.

Again, this is only a story.  There is a moral, though, and that is "Don't fuck with a Dick!".

We went to Malibu SpeedZone last night and I noticed that all the track managers are now wearing headset microphones and no longer have the hand-held versions.  We usually go to SpeedZone when we're entertaining guests... ...it's one of those suped-up gocart joints where they actually let you drink beer AND drive a motorized vehicle.  Why the mention of the headsets and what the hell do they have to do with the gaming industry? ...well, let me tell you a little story that will relate the two and show you how to seize any and all opportunities for PR...

The last time we were there, about two weeks ago, we were entertaining a visiting not-to-be-named-here bigwig... ...verily, he's the editor of one of the biggest gaming mags around and a visit from him is a truly distinguishing honor.  Anyhow, we were there and the levelord was consuming beer... ...go figure, when he happened to notice a hand-held microphone sitting near the entrance to one of the tracks.  He figured it must be broken, just sitting there and all, so he whispered "testing" into it to check.  A booming "TESTING!!!" echoed throughout the entire facility and the track manager was on our lord quicker than shit through a goose (that's fast, BTW), grabbing for the microphone.

It was a quick laugh and we continued on to the track and took a tour of laps.  When we finished and were exiting the track, guess what the levelord found sitting right at the exit? ...yes sireee, the microphone!  This time, no testing was required and he quietly tucked it under his shirt and continued out.  The facility is set up with a centralized area for sitting and drinking and drinking, and the different tracks circling this center area.  The next hour was a fun-filled, belly-aching round of live, on-the-air promotion for SiN, Ritual, and that certain magazine.  It was very childish and I haven't laughed so much for a long while.  It was a cat-n-mouse chase as the lord would blurt some PR into the microphone, tuck it away, and watch the track managers go scrambling for the source.  The Dallas Police were there, too, which added a certain zest of seriousness to it all.  

I was hoping to find that microphone again last night, but as I said, they now wear headsets... ...bummer!

Oh ya, ...I remember now.  I recently re-installed QSpy and Quakeworld, and have now re-rentered the deathmatch mania I had forgotten.  Paradox and Giggler have been playing all along, but we've been so busy that I haven't played since before the pack was released.  I've been thinking, as these two gladiators blast it out, how juvenile they act... ...yelling and screaming and blaming hardware and bandwidths for their occasional deaths... ...how juvenile, me thought, ...it's just a game.  I mean, they seem to get truly upset over it all.  Now I remember, though!  You do get intensely caught up in it and really do get passionate over each and every death.  I figure my mouse has maybe another week to go before I succumb to the impulse and throw it across the room in a fit of rage, ...deathmatch is sooo cool!

Heard an interesting game-related story from an old childhood friend of mine that reminds me why I don't have any plants, pets, or people at home with me.  Tom Regan is the weekend anchorperson for Channel 2 News in Atlanta, Georgia.  I gave him a copy of Scourge and Duke while I was in Hot `Lanta for E3 and he, evidently, gave them to his 4-year old Sean.  Sean is so enamered with Duke that he took the Duke mouse pad and some toothpaste, and pasted the mouse pad on the bathroom wall... ...very cool, Sean, very cool indeed!

Damn it!  Dr. Sleep is going to show-off his Athens level at ETCS, ...there go my hopes for my mansion level ;(  It's never easy for the Levelord.

Hmmmm... ...saw an interesting show last night on A&E called "The Unexplained".  It did in fact leave me wondering.  The topic was the use of psychotropic substances on other things than recreational reasons, specifically, the enhancement of creativity while tripping.  The last segment focused on the proposed effects that psychodelics had on the computer industry in it's infancy years.  A Bob Wallis, founding member of Microsoft, said while talking about new marketing techniques that he in fact invented the concept of shareware and the method of giving away part of the product and selling the rest... ...hmmmm, I thought I just left the company that invented shareware, ...truly unexplained.

Just returned from The Fray and must say that is was indeed a trip.  It wasn't as big as M3 or QuakeCon, but it was well-planned and alot of fun.  I wish I could have stayed longer.  The Cyberweb Cafe is awesome, too!  This is what an internet cafe should be... ...open, full bar with a sandwich/pastry shop to-boot and, ...oh yes, internet terminals.  I had a really great time at the party and want to thank all the Cyber Dudes for their
