It's so cool! ...Father Rob put a red light bulb in the spot light that shines on our front door.  It looks almost as real as the colored lighting in our games, too!

=================
07/29/1997

Wow... ...this has to be one of the coolest things yet...  ..."Scourge of Armagon" got #1 in Top Action Game *and* Top 100 Games of Computer Gaming World's Reader Poll (Sept. 1997).  Sorry for sitting on the laurels, but this is so coool!

=================
07/21/1997

Well, ...it's over and done, ...and it was truly awesome.  The showing at QuakeCon `97 was beyond expectation and, other than a few priliminary power problems, all went extremely well.  Hats off to Holiday Inn for catering to our every need, BTW.

We invited Elexis Sinclaire's sister, Elana, to hand-out SiN shirts.  Actually, being the sister of sinister Elexis, she forced the Quakers to work for their shirts... ...no free give-aways from this family.  Many-a-Quaker had to subject himself to tortuous whipping (with their own belts!), acts of social debasing (boot-kissing and bent-kneed poetry swooning), and anatomical queries.

One of the queries was to guess the size of Elana's... ...errr, ...cups.  True to the definition of geek, one Quaker blerted out "22R".  22R!  ...that's the caliber of a very small rifle, not the dimension of these artillery-sized barrels.  Blue, in a blast of brilliance, tagged her immeditely as a 38D.  The man knows his shells!

As a small anecdote... ...Saturday morning I was passing the conference room after breakfast and caught the tail-end of a conversation between an older couple and their daughter who, obviously, were not there for the convention.  The wife, hearing the explosions and gunplay from the conference room, exclaimed to the husband "Gee, I thought that Quakers (the Religious Society of Friends) were against violence!?!"

Tom and I held a level designing seminar with Steve and Jim from Rogue.  They really are goofballs and it really is cool working with them.  I was afraid that the event would be a small gathering, with each side only staring at each other for a half an hour.  However, it turned into a very informative (thanks crowd for the intelligent questions and worthy idea swapping) and humorous (thanks Steve and Jim for the comic relief) two hours.

Ion Storm held an very cool side party Saturnight at a nearby hotel; those bastards do know how to throw a party!  Just about everyone was there... ...from the Ionics themselves (where were you Dr. Sleep!), to the Ritualistics, to the Roguish Wonderers, to the Apostles of Apogee (now know as The Church of 3D Realms).  Billy and his Society of the Damned finished-off the evening with a demonic jam that I thought would surely get us all tossed from the hotel.

Word has it that there may be a British QuakeCon this year.  Let's all hope so; I've never seen the UkCon before.

=================
07/17/1997

It like Woodstock in Plano!  QuakeCon is indeed fricken HUGE!  There's about 700 people there, computers galore, and the floor looks like some spaghetti factory blew up.  They've dropped the power cicuit and can only support less than half the computers, so today they're driving in an industrial power generator... ...way cool.  On the way home last night, I'd swear I saw the lights of the Dallas skyline dim on and off a few times.

=================
07/15/1997

Holy sheep shit!  I swung by QuakeCon last night and this year's gathering is going to be HUGE!  I remember last year when maybe 100 people showed, this year we've leaped by an order of magnitude.

=================
07/11/1997

Dozens feared killed by Quake in Venezuela!?!   ...Oh my god! ...What have we done!

=================
07/09/1997

Hopefully my finger is up and erect, yes?  We'll test it with a bit of IRS madness... ...the IRS, in a flash of ever-efficient bureaucracy, just sent me an 8822 Form (Rev. May 1995, OMB No. 1545-1163).  This is a "Change of Address" form that I need to use to alert them that I moved last August.  They sent it to my current address.

=================
06/29/1997

Georgia? ...but I'm a Connecticut Yankee!

This was the best E3 so far, ...by far!  I've seen three E3's now, ...or would that simplify to nine... ...anyhow, this one was the finest.  I looove L.A., but I thoroughly enjoyed Hot `Lanta even more.  The people are very friendly, everything is far less expensive, and events are much more convenient.  Atlanta is a clean, upscale city and it has some of the coolest looking buildings (level designer, sorry) I've ever seen.

Let the Games Begin.

Watching the three E3's go by, it seems that the gaming community has definitely evolved from a black-rimmed-glasses, pocket-protector-wearing gathering of geeks, through an I'm-trying-to-be-cool, let's-go-to-the-titty-bar bunch of wannabe's, to finally a more let's-get-seriously-fucked-up-while-we-can, after-the-concert rock party fest.  I really hurt myself each and every night this time, and now I feel like a totally rejuvenated dude.

The show itself was better, as well.  I didn't see enough of the booths, but what I saw was well-layed out and, again, convenience was at a prime.  Women, and I mean in-the-industry types and not just paid-to-be-there models, are surely saturating the industry.  My attention was often diverted from demontrating SiN to a passing princess.

Oh Ya, ...The Convention.

Speaking strickly professionally, I must confess that I only really saw three other games:  Quake 2, Daikatanabanananarama, and Half-Life.  All three made me fear for my future employment and all three should be eagerly anticipated by the public!  I wish I had seen more, but I was really dented from preparing for E3 the past few months.

A Piece of Heaven Amongst the Hell.

Even at it's Atlantic best, E3 can be a grueling three days.  All we do is sit all year at our computers.  Then, we demand three straight days of standing and walking on our poor feet, and three not-so-straight nights of partying on our heads.  Activision did a superb job on the booth, and that really helped make the situation more comfortable.  I'm always more than impressed with the way they treat me professionally, but more import to me, I really like them personally.  Actually, Activision has some very entertaining characters, ...you know who you are, ...Mitch!

Entertaining the Entertainers.

The Activion party was a blast!  It's so nice to see contemporaries on terms other than work-related.  The party was jammed with people and there was a substantial line just to get in, ...IF you could get in.  The beer was free and the food was worthy of a Viking Victory Feast.  I got to meet Ron Millar and thank him for all the hours I've wasted on Warcraft II.

Real Celebrities.

Mr. Willis should have mingled because he could have met some of the soon-to-be-celebrities, and already-celebrating, characters of the entertainment industry.  Poe played a set; they were very cool and very chiche.  They were playing downstairs, but I opted to stay up in the balcony and watch their show on the big screen, ...in the comforting surroundings of lovely, catering waitresses and a two-foot-high, three-foot-wide (no shit) mound of snow crab claws.  

Michael The Master.

I nearly busted my crustacean-filled gut, though, when I saw Poe reach down to this hand in the audience to grab an invitation to our party "Nightfall".  With only the back of a hand for identifying, I immediately knew it was Hadwin, ...the man is on a constant state of alert and readiness, ...god bless him.

Nightfall!

The Ritual/Ion Storm party, "Nightfall", that followed the next evening did some serious damage to quite a few people and we're sorry for any future malities that may incur.  I think we even rearranged some chromosomes on some of the younger attendees. Poe never did show up, by the way.

A Dark Shadow Looms.

About half-way into the party, I was meditating with two beers in hand and a third tucked in the Levis (popular parties do potables a precious possesion make, ...alas, poor Lord) and realizing how wonderfully numb my feet finally felt.  All of a sudden there's this dark, sullen face peering directly at me.  Moments went by without a word, during the while I'm wondering what the fuck is up with Gomez Addams here.

Finally I here "Hi, I'm Mal." in a monotone voice.  "Mal? ...Mal? ...No shit!  ...Malvern Blackwell?".  Mal, Dr. Sleep, and I all cut our teeth together on DOOM levels.  We've known each other for three or more years, but I only met Dr. Sleep a few weeks ago at an Ion Storm bash, and here finally was Malvern Blackwell (I still think this a stage name he made up).  

The Black, The Sleepful, and The Clairvoyant.

I hussled Mal over to Dr. Sleep and it was so cool to all get together finally.  Actually, I had predicted such a meeting when we first met years ago, and seeing it happen was so very cool, ...very cool indeed.

BLOODy Saint Nick.

Nick Newhard and Shade, both Monolithographers and Providers of All Things BLOODy, were there, too.  Nick is the dude that opened the door for me, and to some extent Dr. Sleep and Mal, as we all worked on BLOOD in it's early days.  It's always good to see Nick because I owe him a great deal.  More consequentially, though, I now have a registered copy of BLOOD and can finally see the entire gorey mess.

The Last Event.

The last "event" of E3 was a cut-throat, no-holds-barred basketball match between Ritual and Ion Storm.  I must say that I was amazed these guys could even stand up after three days of E3, let alone play B-ball for 30 minutes.  Ritual won, but not with pride.  Like I said, all friendships and human decencies are dissolved at the court's boundary, and I'm afraid we won more because we did things like jam Cat Daddy Wilson into the wall and stomp on DaBug's knees when he fell to the floor.  Basketball is a nsty sport, it is.

Fucking E3! and days that will make the Dallas Zoo seem like kindergarten...

The tRuly sCary oNe will be posting a DM level of mine, called "Hipside", on our Hipnotic page on the 10th.  It's a small, special level that was on the Computer Gaming World CD this June.  It's nothing to write home about, but anyone interested is welcome to grab it then.  It has been populated for singleplay, BTW.

=================
06/07/1997

Time2Quake is having a contest called "The Race to Oblivion". It's using some wanker DM level called HIPDM1 from some shelf-space-wasting add-on pack called "The Scourge Of Armagon". The contest runs through Friday June 27th.

=================
06/06/1997

Well, went to a very cooool party last night with the Ion freaks, some roving Rogues, a few Rebel Boat Rockers, a Paradigms (that's four nickels to you and me), and an assortment of other contemporaries from the industry.  Some visiting Gamespot dignitaries were also there.  We pre-lubed ourselves at a rooftop party first, then all headed over to a local club to watch Billy and Society of the Damned do their thing.  Very groovy band and highly recommended, ...kind of a Pantera/Metallica blend.

We even got in some good moshing!  Moshing is one of those things that makes me realize I never really matured much past the age of about 13.  It makes me realize that my body has matured, though, `cause I am one hurtin' puppy today.  I warn all of you, too, that if you ever get the chance to mosh with Cat Daddy Wilson, and his one eye starts to squint and he gets this Dennis The Menace look on his face... ...it's time to pick another target!

Best of all, I finally got to meet the great Dr. Sleep.  We've been good friends for about 3 years now, both having cut our teeth on DOOM and Blood, but we have never met.  It's true, BTW, he does have an aura, ...it's light blue in color.

=================
06/05/1997

I'm sorry, and I'm not even sure why I care other than I believe everyone should have a little respect for their home, but you can take both Pepsi and Coke and let them evaporate in the summer's sun!  This is Dallas and, by god, the drink is Dr. Pepper!

=================
06/02/1997

What an incredible concert!  I highly recommend any and all headbangers, both young and old (yes, that's you, too, Blue), to see the Ozzfest that's touring right now.  Joe Siegler and I went last night and it was such a blast to hear Black Sabbath AND Ozzy perform together, ...incredible indeed!

=================
04/30/1997

My god, what an incredible coincidence!  I never realized that the initials of my three favorite comedians, Steve Martin, George Burns, and Shorty Bernstein, are also the initials of three people at Apogee.  These initials can be found, by the truly observant, in "The Crypt" (HIP2M4).

=================
03/25/1997

They don't call it "pussy" for nothing!  I'm always amazed at how closely felines remind me of females.  I often make the acquaintence of a neighborhood cat when I go in the backyard and take a break.  I love cats, and I love women, so please don't take me wrong about my attitude.  I admire both of these groups for their superiority over me, at least ;)  Anyhow, I'm petting this cat this morning, it's purring and rubbing my leg in happy response, and all seems superb.  Then, out of the blue and for no apparent reason, at least to me, the cat lounges up and bites the very hand that's petting it!  No love nip, this is a full-fledged, blood-drawing piercing!  Then, in as quick of an instance as the attack, the cat is back to purring and looking at me like "Ya? ...why'd ya stop, Rich!".

=================
03/21/1997

With all the shit-slinging going on related to Duke Nukem, ...and I'm definitely one of the cultivators of compost, ...I hope everyone knows that the real credit for that game goes to Todd Replogle and Allan Blum IX or XVII or something.  The rest of us, all of us, were only good support.  Both of these California fruitcakes are too easy-going to ever say anything, so I thought I would ;)

Damn I love level designing!  I'm well into my first level for our next game and it is so cool!  ...not the level, I mean, ...the activity.  The first third portion of a level's lifecycle is the best - raising new architecture and geometries, concocting crazy gadgets and gizmos, daydreaming singleplayer combats and fight sequences, ...what a blast!

Paradox of Peon has a really cool looking Quake Rally level nearing the finish line.  Even the lord isn't sure how he's pulling off the outside areas, framerate-wise.  Serf Giggler, the Bastard from Lands-Far-Away (Massachusetts, actually), has some very, very cool looking structures and has me thinking that "Shit, I'd better do something cool!" thought once again, ...so, I guess I'm off...

=================
03/17/1997

If you're not truly sick of hearing me spew, there's a very humorous interview (comedy provided by FragMaster, ...at my expense, though) on New Vor Times.

The Hipnotists had a great time last night at WorldCraft University last night.  Even the deity himself, some guy called "Romero", was there.  There's a log of the chat on the WorldCraft page, BTW.

=================
03/16/1997

I've always said that I would never again do a level for free, ...but I have.  Only for the great and all-powerful Computer Gaming World, though.  I've made a special level for their June issue; it will be on the CD... ...please look for it because this is a ground-up level and not just the throw-aways from the pack.  It is deathmatch-oriented, but I added singleplayer stuff, too.  The level has also been coupled with Lone Gun's "Severed Player Pack" which is one of the funniest add-ons I've seen yet!

=================
03/15/1997

Just re-read the interview on Gamesmania, ...yes, yes, a very weak ego needs to feed often, ...and I must say that this interview is the best experience I've had with "the press".  Not that any experiences of mine have been anything but great, but those Canadian bastards at ifront did a fantastic job and I have never been so pleased.  Thanks, CanUks!

=================

The Levelord has an interview coming up in Gamesmania today (http://www.gamesmania.com).  All
