Did The Levelord's Forecast peg it on the head, or what!?! ...57% Bush/Cheney and 43% Gore/Lieberman, ...with the standard +/- 17% (the 17% being Florida, of course).

Shit!  Okay, I looked-up herniated cervicle disk myself.  I was wondering whether it is usually caused by trauma or wear-and-tear.  I would at first guess trauma, like a sports injury or accident, but we know how much physical activity I see, ...none.  I thought then maybe it's a repeated stress kind of thing, like man-handling a mouse and casting worlds of gore and destruction all day.  Nope, ...it's neither.  80% of this kind of slipped disk is age-related.  I want my money, and I want to find a small island somewhere!

Eeee gads!  ...it's Election Day here in the U.S..  First, let it be known that I think it should be a legal obligation for every citizen to vote, ...even if you only go in to cast a null ballot.  I'm not buying that "I don't keep track of the issues!" shit.  We were at lunch yesterday, celebrating some new Tribe members and some visiting ones as well, when Mark asked "Who's voting tomorrow?".  Three of the twelve hands went up.  Shame, shame, shame!

The Levelord's Forecast?  ...57% Bush/Cheney and 43% Gore/Lieberman, ...with the standard +/- 17% uncertainty gap, of course.

Like the general public, I am really torn this time.  I like and dislike both major candidates.  I can't say which way I'm finally going, but we can play with the finger, yes?  First, I make a comfortable living and I'm over 40-years old, ...so there's a Republican vote.  However, I also like the last 8 years, things went well, ...and I abhor nepotism, ...even the hint of it.  Finally, I am a registered Independent (for the unfamiliar, that means I'm not a Democrat or a Republican, and I refuse to vote for Ralph Nader).

I do have to consider my vocation.  I mean, I really want to have gore and sex in my games, not Gore and Lieberman.  Don't get me wrong, ...I am for a strong rating system and enforcement, but Hartford Joe seems a little too enthusiastic and grandstanding on the issue.  Lieberman is from Connecticut, but George W. was born in New Haven AND he's a Texan.  Then again, ...George W. was born in New Haven and is a Texan ;)  I'm still not absolutely sure which way I'll go, but I think the Levelord's Forecast will be close, at least personally.

Speaking of New Haven, ...how about a very small Dick Story.  Actually, I decided last night to fess-up to this one myself.  It's the Year 2000 and I should not be embarrassed about getting beat-up by a girl, especially in the name of love.  This one was going to be called "The First Time Dick Saw a Pussy.".

Last week I remembered the first day I saw the female counterpart to my Snow Pen.  It was in 2nd or 3rd grade, ...I can't remember which as these two school years seem to blend together.  I can only remember the teachers as different.  

Anyway, this happened in the playground of the Timothy Dwight Elementary School in New Haven.  The section of town that I lived in was 70% Black, 20% Puerto Rican, and 10% white.  It was also the 1960s.  I only mention those facts to set the atmosphere.  Most of everyone in the immediate neighborhood got together very well.  There was that innocence of youth, too, that didn't really see things like skin, ...over-weightness yes, but skin, no. Also, my step-grandmother is Black (Grandpa married her before I was born, and she was my plain old Grandma as far as I ever knew), so I don't want to hear any PC stuff.  I mean, politally correctedness, ...personal computer stuff is okay, ...I'll hear that, of course.

Where was I, ...oh yes, ...New Haven was a very rough town and you either learned to fight real well (against typically out-numbering foes), or how to run like a gazelle.  I remember one time climbing up a chain-link fence, on to a single-story garage, across the roof, and leaping the full 12 feet down the other side in order to get away.  I also remember other times looking back over my shoulder to see slower friends get over-taken, tackled, and get the living shit beat out of them.  It was like watching a real-life National Geographic of lions taking down a wildebeest.  It always made me feel guilt-ridden for not going back to help, but like I say, the odds were most often stacked well above any possible recourse other than self-salvation.

This is all to say that I turned out to be a flyer rather than a fighter.  Not that I wouldn't fight, mind you, I just knew when it was best to run.  This particular school yard encounter was even worse than out-numbering odds, though.  It was an encounter with a pack of classmate girls.  

Now, anyone who has had to deal with this knows it's a no-win situation.  You can't run because that would look like unforgivable cowardly (remember this is all being evaluated with the social values of an 8-9 year old).  You can't fight back because beating up girls was unforgivable, too, even with all the racial tension being used as a mitigating defense.  I pretty much just played limp dummy and let Roberta, Porche, Dianna, Yvone, etc. have at me.  It was really only taunting and pushing, not any physical pain, ...until Cynthia started in.

She got very physical as the mob-mentality fed on the feast.  After a few shoves, I was on the ground.  I can still remember her smell, and the smell of the sand.  She was a very pretty girl, ...just slightly friendlier than a wet badger, but very pretty. She eventually had me fully pinned on my back with her spread-eagled legs holding my arms down.  She looked down at me, then her crotch, and pulled her panties to one side.  She kept yelling "Want to see my pussy, whiteboy?!?  ...huh, cracker?!?".  Although I had been able to maintain internal composure up until the pinning, I was now in deep confusion, fear, and panic.  

What the hell was this!?!  Both my parents were artists, and I saw a lot of nude bodies (in the form of "art") as a very young child.  I knew the difference between girls and boys, ...but to have one shoved in my face, ...after getting beat-up by a bunch of girls, ...well, it was a time to remember.  It was a time to upgrade my social values, ...and tactics.

Wait a minute, should I consider this a rape?  ...a GANG rape?!?  Have I been violated?  ...sorry, that's not funny.  I do regret not being fully aware of real intentions back then.  I now know that Cynthia was probably attracted to the Levelad and he could have had some nifty games of Doctor with her.

Yes, yes, the BaDmAn is here!  I went to the airport on Saturday to pick him up.  It was hilarious sitting in the International Arrival section.  I caught two different nationalities (thick accent and ethnic garb) saying "Y'all".  I know it really isn't anything special and shows my Amero-centric narrow-mindedness, but to hear a Pakistani say "Y'all made it okay?" in a real thick accent just floored me.

I got word from the doctor.  The MRI test is back, ...herniated disk between the C6 and C7 vertebrae.  I knew it wasn't just cramps from passing out. I'm never sure, in these situations, whether I want to hear that they found something or not.  Is it better that there is a cause, or that it was some mysterious, probably in your brain kind of thing.  The doctor is suggesting neuro-surgery.  This is the guy that through two medications at me for high blood pressure and cholesterol, and maybe mentioned exercise once and diet never.  The pain is gone and the numbness is almost gone.  I'm staying right here in the office, thank you.

You know what's really cool about all that above there?  I will get at least a dozen emails with very good advice from people who have had this affliction.  What a cool and connected world!  My recent email about this neck thing hastened a dude from Europe, now living in Australia, who knew two top-notch chiropractors right here in Dallas, ...cool and connected world, it is!

I need to drum-up a Dick Story after all this crying.  Have I done the "First Time Dick Ever Saw a Pussy." Story yet?

Okay, okay, so everyone, I mean EVERYONE knows "Real Genius".  The question is strengthened, ...why is it NOT on DVD!  ... ;)  

Also, please stop sending emails suggesting that I find a female counterpart, a Lady of the Levels, so to speak, and procreate!  One nice thing about getting older is that you know more about what you want.  No plants, no pets, no people!  Besides, we don't want this gene pool propagating itself anymore than it has.

Like I said, I am very nostalgic and sentimental.  I have always been.  I remember pining for New Haven when we moved to New Canaan when I wa
