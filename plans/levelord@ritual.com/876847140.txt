An amusing little anecdote reared its head a couple of weeks ago, and since no one else seems to want to put their finger on it, ...the lord will.  It's a shame, really, that it wasn't reported more closely to its occurrence, because it's lost some of its zeal.   ...and we had photos, too!

In this story, we'll change the names again to protect the innocent.  Mike "Giggle Me This!" Wardwell's birthday happened a few weeks ago.  Not just any birthday, mind you, but his 21st.   Our little boy is all grown-up, Marge ;(  We wanted to make sure that it was a memorable birthday for him, so we took him to Baby Dolls uptown.  Besides being his birthday, it was also Friday, ...so, you know.

We went to this den of will repute and were soon being entertained by a bevy of Texan beauties.  A particularly adorable one immediately picked out our new hunter from the tribe.  There seemed to be magic in the air, ...you could smell it, and Harry "Pssst, Come Here, I've got lots of twenties..." made sure to let her know it was her target's, ...ummm, ...new friend's Cumming of Age Ritual.

Veronica!  Veronica "Play My Flute Like a Harmonica!" was truly charming, and soon we learned why Mike is called The Giggler.  It was embarrassing, actually, but hey, he's part of the kinship and we have to accept him!  I was soon to learn, though, what had him snickering so childishly.  Miss Birthday Box peeled herself from Giggler's lap and bedicked, ...ah, bedecked mine.  ...just thinking about this story has me all choked up in romance, ...anyway, no sooner had she straddled my leg did I feel this vice-grip wrenching around my thigh.  It was incredible, this girl!  Nautilus must be doing some whacked things lately.  We're talking labial pinching here, not squeezing her thighs around mine.  It was like having a horse try to peel oats from the side of my leg.  It was incredible!  She smiled a knowing smirk and was soon barnacled back on the birthday boy.

Some time passed, and some beers, and then I passed some of the beers.  When I got back, Veronica looked over at me while she slightly pulled down Giggler's shirt neck.  She was grimacing in painfully restrained hysteria as she showed me about a half a dozen of the biggest, most purpled sucker bites I have ever seen!  Any of you Trekkies or old farts remember that original Star Trek that had an alien that would suck the salt out of you and leave these horrific suction marks in the process?  ...Mike looked worse!  ...much worse!

Mrs. Giggler, the Mother of All Things Gigglish, was due in town to visit her son the very next morning, BTW.

I knew it, ...I just knew it!  There was a fire truck, sirens a' blarin' and lights a' flashin', out in front of the Ion Storm building this morning!  ...I knew all that hair was a fire hazard!

...BTW, thanks back at cha, Master Cloud ;)

The following is a story.  It is only a story and does necessarily relate to any truth or actuality.  The names have been changed to protect the innocent... ...as well as the guilty.

It seems this dude, we'll call him Dick, came to work the other day only to find that the parking lot was packed to near capacity.  Dick was running late and needed to park.  There were available spaces way at the top of the parking structure, he was sure, but there was also a nice spot still open right near the elevator.  The only problem was that this spot was being half-consumed by some fruitcake in the adjacent spot that didn't have the time to park straight and correct.  This happens alot and I'm sure you can appreciate Dick's frustration at the inconsiderable piggish parking that ruined an otherwise prime location.

Dick drives a van and exiting his vehicle from either side is quite convenient for him.  With that in mind, he inched his car into the 2/3 slot, thus blocking the driver's door of the offensive bastard one over.  Two birds with one stone Dick thought...a cool parking spot AND a little "Consider this, asshole!" to-boot.

As many of these things do, the situation escalated.  When Dick was leaving at the end of the day, he noticed a hand-written note on his windshield stating something to the effect of "You blocked me out of my car, you hit my right front bumber in doing so, I've taken down your liscense number, and I've filed a police report."  The twit even added a report number which, we figure, was to make Dick really sweat over his foul deed.

Well, Dick didn't hit the bumber, but he did sweat about the note.  He figured the best thing to do was to likewise take down the other person's liscense... ...which he did.  The next morning, at spying the hog dog's car again, he took down their liscense... ...I mean he took down their liscense! ...right off the back of the car!  Dick hopes that the police will be filing another report soon.

Again, this is only a story.  There is a moral, though, and that is "Don't fuck with a Dick!".

We went to Malibu SpeedZone last night and I noticed that all the track managers are now wearing headset microphones and no longer have the hand-held versions.  We usually go to SpeedZone when we're entertaining guests... ...it's one of those suped-up gocart joints where they actually let you drink beer AND drive a motorized vehicle.  Why the mention of the headsets and what the hell do they have to do with the gaming industry? ...well, let me tell you a little story that will relate the two and show you how to seize any and all opportunities for PR...

The last time we were there, about two weeks ago, we were entertaining a visiting not-to-be-named-here bigwig... ...verily, he's the editor of one of the biggest gaming mags around and a visit from him is a truly distinguishing honor.  Anyhow, we were there and the levelord was consuming beer... ...go figure, when he happened to notice a hand-held microphone sitting near the entrance to one of the tracks.  He figured it must be broken, just sitting there and all, so he whispered "testing" into it to check.  A booming "TESTING!!!" echoed throughout the entire facility and the track manager was on our lord quicker than shit through a goose (that's fast, BTW), grabbing for the microphone.

It was a quick laugh and we continued on to the track and took a tour of laps.  When we finished and were exiting the track, guess what the levelord found sitting right at the exit? ...yes sireee, the microphone!  This time, no testing was required and he quietly tucked it under his shirt and continued out.  The facility is set up with a centralized area for sitting and drinking and drinking, and the different tracks circling this center area.  The next hour was a fun-filled, belly-aching round of live, on-the-air promotion for SiN, Ritual, and that certain magazine.  It was very childish and I haven't laughed so much for a long while.  It was a cat-n-mouse chase as the lord would blurt some PR into the microphone, tuck it away, and watch the track managers go scrambling for the source.  The Dallas Police were there, too, which added a certain zest of seriousness to it all.  

I was hoping to find that microphone again last night, but as I said, they now wear headsets... ...bummer!

Oh ya, ...I remember now.  I recently re-installed QSpy and Quakeworld, and have now re-rentered the deathmatch mania I had forgotten.  Paradox and Giggler have been playing all along, but we've been so busy that I haven't played since before the pack was released.  I've been thinking, as these two gladiators blast it out, how juvenile they act... ...yelling and screaming and blaming hardware and bandwidths for their occasional deaths... ...how juvenile, me thought, ...it's just a game.  I mean, they seem to get truly upset over it all.  Now I remember, though!  You do get intensely caught up in it and really do get passionate over each and every death.  I figure my mouse has maybe another week to go before I succumb to the impulse and throw it across the room in a fit of rage, ...deathmatch is sooo cool!

Heard an interesting game-related story from an old childhood friend of mine that reminds me why I don't have any plants, pets, or people at home with me.  Tom Regan is the weekend anchorperson for Channel 2 News in Atlanta, Georgia.  I gave him a copy of Scourge and Duke while I was in Hot `Lanta for E3 and he, evidently, gave them to his 4-year old Sean.  Sean is so enamered with Duke that he took the Duke mouse pad and some toothpaste, and pasted the mouse pad on the bathroom wall... ...very cool, Sean, very cool indeed!

Damn it!  Dr. Sleep is going to show-off his Athens level at ETCS, ...there go my hopes for my mansion level ;(  It's never easy for the Levelord.

Hmmmm... ...saw an interesting show last night on A&E called "The Unexplained".  It did in fact leave me wondering.  The topic was the use of psychotropic substances on other things than recreational reasons, specifically, the enhancement of creativity while tripping.  The last segment focused on the proposed effects that psychodelics had on the computer industry in it's infancy years.  A Bob Wallis, founding member of Microsoft, said while talking about new marketing techniques that he in fact invented the concept of shareware and the method of giving away part of the product and selling the rest... ...hmmmm, I thought I just left the company that invented shareware, ...truly unexplained.

Just returned from The Fray and must say that is was indeed a trip.  It wasn't as big as M3 or QuakeCon, but it was well-planned and alot of fun.  I wish I could have stayed longer.  The Cyberweb Cafe is awesome, too!  This is what an internet cafe should be... ...open, full bar with a sandwich/pastry shop to-boot and, ...oh yes, internet terminals.  I had a really great time at the party and want to thank all the Cyber Dudes for their efforts.

On a lighter side, I found a way to make sweet lemonade out of what has been, at least for me, a truly sour mouthful.  Until now, I have had nothing but anger and frustration at all the phone soliciting that I get.  At least three times a month I get hauled off the toilet or from the middle of cooking or some other activity to answer the phone... ...only to find that it's fricken AT&T (who I will NEVER employ again) asking me to switch long distance service.

Anyhow, I have a solution that will have you on the floor laughing each and everytime you use it.  When the bastard asks for "the decision-maker", tell him/her to hang on while you go get them.  Yell out a "Honeyyyy... ...it's AT&T about that long distance you wanted...".  I have found that the dup will stay there waiting for at least 1-2 minutes.  You can elongate the bastard's downtime by, at approximately 1-2 minutes, picking up the phone and asking if the decision-maker has answered yet.  When they say "No", reassure them that you'll go check.  You can an additional 2-3 minutes this way.  Try it... ...it's funnier than shit to go about your original task and occasionally pick up the phone to hear the silent waiting, ...just a suggestion.

It's so cool! ...Father Rob put a red light bulb in the spot light that shines on our front door.  It looks almost as real as the colored lighting in our games, too!

Wow... ...this has to be one of the coolest things yet...  ..."Scourge of Armagon" got #1 in Top Action Game *and* Top 100 Games of Computer Gaming World's Reader Poll (Sept. 1997).  Sorry for sitting on the laurels, but this is so coool!

07/21/1997

Well, ...it's over and done, ...and it was truly awesome.  The showing at QuakeCon `97 was beyond expectation and, other than a few priliminary power problems, all went extremely well.  Hats off to Holiday Inn for catering to our every need, BTW.

We invited Elexis Sinclaire's sister, Elana, to hand-out SiN shirts.  Actually, being the sister of sinister Elexis, she forced the Quakers to work for their shirts... ...no free give-aways from this family.  Many-a-Quaker had to subject himself to tortuous whipping (with their own belts!), acts of social debasing (boot-kissing and bent-kneed poetry swooning), and anatomical queries.

One of the queries was to guess the size of Elana's... ...errr, ...cups.  True to the definition of geek, one Quaker blerted out "22R".  22R!  ...that's the caliber of a very small rifle, not the dimension of these artillery-sized barrels.  Blue, in a blast of brilliance, tagged her immeditely as a 38D.  The man knows his shells!

As a small anecdote... ...Saturday morning I was passing the conference room after breakfast and caught the tail-end of a conversation between an older couple and their daughter who, obviously, were not there for the convention.  The wife, hearing the explosions and gunplay from the conference room, exclaimed to the husband "Gee, I thought that Quakers (the Religious Society of Friends) were against violence!?!"

Tom and I held a level designing seminar with Steve and Jim from Rogue.  They really are goofballs and it really is cool working with them.  I was afraid that the event would be a small gathering, with each side only staring at each other for a half an hour.  However, it turned into a very informative (thanks crowd for the intelligent questions and worthy idea swapping) and humorous (thanks Steve and Jim for the comic relief) two hours.

Ion Storm held an very cool side party Saturnight at a nearby hotel; those bastards do know how to throw a party!  Just about everyone was there... ...from the Ionics themselves (where were you Dr. Sleep!), to the Ritualistics, to the Roguish Wonderers, to the Apostles of Apogee (now know as The Church of 3D Realms).  Billy and his Society of the Damned finished-off the evening with a demonic jam that I thought would surely get us all tossed from the hotel.

Word has it that there may be a British QuakeCon this year.  Let's all hope so; I've never seen the UkCon before.

=================
07/17/1997

It like Woodstock in Plano!  QuakeCon is indeed fricken HUGE!  There's about 700 people there, computers galore, and the floor looks like some spaghetti factory blew up.  They've dropped the power cicuit and can only support less than half the computers, so today they're driving in an industrial power generator... ...way cool.  On the way home last night, I'd swear I saw the lights of the Dallas skyline dim on and off a few times.

=================
07/15/1997

Holy sheep shit!  I swung by QuakeCon last night and this year's gathering is going to be HUGE!  I remember last year when maybe 100 people showed, this year we've leaped by an order of magnitude.

Dozens feared killed by Quake in Venezuela!?!   ...Oh my god! ...What have we done!
