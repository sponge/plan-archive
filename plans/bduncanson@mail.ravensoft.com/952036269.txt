"Never let your sense of morals get in the way of doing what's right."

Yes Florida does have its old folgies, but remember the more you run over, the more points you get..:)


*********************************
BASIC RULES FOR DRIVING IN FLORIDA
(I think this stands true for most major cities.....)
**********************************
Since most of you like them here are some more.....Tomorrow I will post some that I got from Oregon..
Thanks Mike G!...:)
*******
Braking is to be done as hard and late as possible to ensure that your ABS 
kicks in, giving a nice, relaxing foot massage as the brake pedal pulsates.  
For those of you without ABS, it's a chance to stretch your legs.

The new electronic traffic warning system signs are not there to provide 
useful  information. They are only there to make Florida look high-tech and 
to distract you from seeing the FHP police car parked in the median.

Please remember that there is no such thing as a shortcut during rush-hour 
traffic in Florida.

Throwing litter on the roads adds variety to the landscape, keeps the 
existing litter from getting lonely and gives Adopt-a-highway crews something 
to clean up.

Learn to swerve abruptly. Florida is the home of high-speed slalom driving 
thanks to our city council, who put potholes in key locations to test 
drivers' reflexes and keep them on their toes.

It is traditional in Florida to honk your horn at cars that don't move the 
instant the light changes.

Remember that the goal of every Florida driver is to get there first, by 
whatever means necessary.

Real Floridian women drivers can put on pantyhose and apply eye makeup at 
seventy-five miles per hour in bumper-to-bumper traffic.

All Florida drivers are required to use a cellular phone while driving. It 
makes it easier to call 911 when they hit someone and FHP can respond more 
quickly to block off 2 or more lanes of traffic....especially during rush 
hour.

Heavy fog, and rain are no reasons to change any of the previously listed 
rules. These weather conditions are God's way ensuring the economic 
well-being of body shops, junk yards and new vehicle sales.

Tweaking character texture coordinates. Time consuming, but has to be done. Got to build a 3D chessboard model for
MRJ yesterday. Never knew such a thing existed. Pretty cool looking. I wanted to model each piece with its own
identity. But you know how that goes.....low face count. I think it would be cool for example to model archers/knights on top of the rook. Give the Bishop a cool emerald neck cross. Oh well....:)

Tomorrow night my band plays again. I have to get use to singing cover songs. I have never really done that except
for Karaoke. Learning all those lyrics....arrrrrggggg!
