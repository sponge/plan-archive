Quote of the Day!
********************************
"Always acknowledge a fault. This will throw those in 
authority off their guard and give you an opportunity to commit more." 
************************************************

HOW TRUE!
***************
A Software Engineer, a Hardware Engineer and a Departmental 
Manager were on their way to a meeting in Switzerland. They 
were driving down a steep mountain road when suddenly the 
brakes on their car failed. The car careened almost out of 
control down the road, bouncing off the crash barriers, 
until it miraculously ground to a halt, scraping along the 
mountainside. The car's occupants, shaken but unhurt, now 
had a problem: they were stuck halfway down a mountain in a 
car with no brakes. What were they to do?

"I know", said the Departmental Manager, "Let's have a 
meeting, propose a Vision, formulate a Mission Statement, 
define some Goals, and by a process of Continuous 
Improvement find a solution to the Critical Problems, and we 
can be on our way."

"No, no", said the Hardware Engineer, "That will take far 
too long, and besides, that method has never worked before. 
I've got my Swiss Army knife with me, and, in no time at 
all, I can strip down the car's braking system, isolate the 
fault, fix it, and we can be on our way."

"Well", said the Software Engineer, "Before we do anything, 
I think we should push the car back up the road and see if 
it happens again!"


Thanks Tony!

A GOOD WISCONSIN JOKE!
*********************
In the middle of a blizzard, on a dark highway, two guys are driving. 
One's from Wisconsin, the other is a FIB. Due to the poor visibility, 
they crash into each other. They call the cops on a cell phone, and 
while they're waiting, the
