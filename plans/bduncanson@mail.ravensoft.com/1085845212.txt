Both the cockroach and the bird would get along very well without us, although the
cockroach would miss us most.

It has been two years since I updated this thing. Use to do it all the time.
But anyways....XMen is doing very well.
Other than that I have moved into a new position here at Raven.
I still animate, but my main job is something else Brian Raffle thought Raven should do.
Not sure if I can spill the beans or not....I'll have to ask.
Care to take a guess?
