Quote of the Day!

"The best way to keep one's word is not to give it."

THE INNER-CITY HIGH SCHOOL MATH PROFICIENCY EXAM
***************
1).  Little Jimmy has an AK 47 with a 30 round clip. He
     usually misses 6 out of every 10 shots and he uses 13
     rounds per drive-by shooting. How many drive-by shootings
     can Little Johnny attempt before he has to reload?

2).  Jose has 2 ounces of cocaine. If he sells an 8 ball to
     Antonio for $320 and 2 grams to Juan for $85 per gram,
     what  is the street value of the rest of his hold?

3).  Rufus pimps 3 hos. If the price is $85 per trick, how
     many tricks per day must each ho turn to support
     Rufus's $800 per day crack habit?

4).  Jerome wants to cut the pound of cocaine he bought
     for $40,000 to make 20% profit. How many ounces
     will he need?

5).  Willie gets $200 for a stolen BMW, $150 for stealing a
     Corvette, and $100 for a 4x4. If he steals 1 BMW,
     2 Corvettes and 3 4x4's, how many more Corvettes must
     he have to steal to have $900?

More to come!

Being from S. Florida....this test sounds all to familiar....right John M.?
