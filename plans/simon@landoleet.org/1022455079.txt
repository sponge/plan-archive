02.15.02 ==============================

In retrospect it's been a really weird 2002. 
Broken ribs, everyone has a cold, Musicnet (Ugh), demanding 
SHOUTcast DJ's, new streaming methods. 
All this while keeping 2 OC48's nearly full every day, 
and it's only February 15th.

I am looking forward to Conxis in March. Esp since I convinced 
Tom to rent the battle star Cadillacdika. Look out! We are coming to town!

Ugh - Broke 3 ribs at holister on Timojhens XR400
Rode the bike off the mountian though. How punk is that?

Good times - excuse me while I take more Perkidan.

I can remember going to countless parties in my twenties. Driving
from one to the next, raves, and breakins and then onto the after
parties. And I can remember thinking, as I drove to those countless
parties, that if I just kept pressing the accelerator my
responsibilities, my duty to grow up would keep fading into a spec in
the cars rearview. 

Then came the turning point. I can recall, vividly, driving home to S.F
on highway 24. I had just learned my fiance was pregnant. I had two
clear cut choices, and I knew what I was going to. I was going to marry
her, raise a family and grow up. As I drove home the feeling I had many
times before came over me. Just floor it! As I looked in the rearview
what I saw fading wasn't my responsibilities, what I saw slipping onto
the horizon behind me was my youth. My car flying head long into the
abdomen of adulthood. 
I was powerless to change it.
Turning points are funny that way. 
I guess thats why there called turning points.


12.09.01 ==============================

Got a wreath on the minivan, Nothing makes a guys feel like Christmas 
like a bunch of tree branches jammed on the front of his vehicle.

12.06.01 ===============================

Toms S4 rocks - he and bonnie came to the burbs for a visit.
It's nice seeing adults once and a while.

Has anyone noticed MusicNets logo is a plastic deal that
you put in a 45 RPM record, to play on record player not meant
to support large holes?

We have a word for that sort of thing - kludge



11.21.01 ===============================
Lots of crap going on in operations land.
Adrian Cockcroft is coming in to give a talk about Sun performance tuning.
I have just handed out a bunch of Shoutcast ports to flaresound, 
basedrive and smoothbeats. 
Now it's time to chill.
I am going to have to ask people to start to roll back their 128k streams next year to 96k 
so as to fit more listeners. 
Lots of new hires in Ops and finally some time to do 
analysis instead of the build/guess/build/fix cycle :
