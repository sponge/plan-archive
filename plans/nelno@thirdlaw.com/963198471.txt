Yes, KISS Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child really is gold.  We will have
a demo out shortly (before the game hits the shelves), because we know how 
important it is to give people a chance to see this game before they buy it.  
We're going to spend a little extra time taking out any extraneous data so 
that we can get the demo as small as possible, while still representing all 
the game has to offer.  That way there won't be any excuse for not downloading 
it and trying it out. :)

Third Law is looking for another programmer to complete our team.  Because 
many of us here got our start making and/or designing our own games in the dark 
of night for no reason other than we loved doing it, we think it's a good 
thing to tap the gaming community for talent.  If you like to play games,
and love to create them, you may have what we're looking for.<BR>
<BR>
Candidates should be able to meet these general requirements:<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Several years of programming experience in the game industry, or as a hobby.</LI><BR>
<LI>Minimum of two years experience using C/C++ (C++ experience is a bonus).</LI><BR>
<LI>Working knowledge of 3D mathematics.</LI><BR>
<LI>Willing to work long hours because you love coding games.</LI><BR>
<LI>Prior experience working with a major 3D engine is a big plus.</LI>
<LI>Able to relocate to the Dallas, Texas area.</LI><BR>
<LI>Must be a resident of the United States (sorry, but immigration stuff is a HUGE hassle).</LI><BR>
<BR>
Please note that these are only general requirements. We don't want to scare
talented individuals away, but there are some baselines that must be met before you will
be considered. Note, however, that examples of work will carry a lot of
weight.<BR>
<BR>
If you are interested and qualified, send some of your work and a resum√© to

I just want to make a quick clarification for Steve Lynch over at 
<A HREF="http://hypothermia.evilavatar.com">http://hypothermia.evilavatar.com</A>.
I gave him an "exclusive" screen shot to go with my interview that he put up 
earlier this week.  As it turns out, someone not-from-Third Law grabbed that same
screenshot from the directory and sent it to at least one other site on the
same day, ruining the whole "exclusive" thing and causing Steve to get several
emails telling him he was a liar and a fraud.
<BR><BR>
Well, he's not. It wasn't his fault and it was just a screwup on our part.  So,
in order to fix the situation we've given Steve two REALLY exclusive screen shots
from KPC's Earth Realm.  So head on over to <A HREF="http://hypothermia.evilavatar.com">Hypothermia</A> to check them out.
And if you sent Steve nasty email, you should send him another one telling him you're sorry for doubting him.

Wow... it's been awhile.  Things are going very well here at Third Law.
We're currently finishing up everything that will be in the demo for
ECTS.  From what I understand, Gathering isn't showing any of it's products
on the floor at ECTS, so this will be a backroom, press-only showing.
The feedback we received from our E3 demo last May was extremely positive,
with a number of people simply blown away, so we're hoping that the content
we've added to the game since then will be even more impressive.  I must
admit, though, it's easier to impress when you're the underdog.  People
(especially hardcore gamers) tend not to expect much from a KISS game, but
we're pouring our hearts into this and making a game we really want to play.
There should be some more screenshots showing tons of gameplay action
(absolutely real -- no faking here) and a new, improved video showing even
more sometime after ECTS (or perhaps even sooner), so stay tuned -- I think 
some people will be surprised by what they see.
