Please disregard the Gamespot UK ECTS 99 article entitled "Will KISS Finally 
Find Their Way".  Unfortunately, Take 2 Interactive has also purchased rights
to create a KISS game, but for a platform <B>other than</B> the PC. Gamespot
has become confused about which is which. While Take 2 may still be trying to
decide what type of game to make with their part of the license, Third Law 
Interactive has had a solid design for "The Nightmare Child" since January of
this year. Take 2 Interactive does not have the rights to create a PC version
of any KISS game, to "The Nightmare Child" name, or to any of the content from 
Todd McFarlane's "Psycho Circus" comic books, which was licensed exclusively 
by Third Law Interactive. Gamespot UK's previous article entitled <A HREF = "http://ects.gamespot.co.uk/pc/previews/0,8618,2329275,00.html">"KISS Psycho
Circus Hits Town"</A> is a much more accurate representation of the game that
Third Law is currently creating.

Wow... it's been awhile.  Things are going very well here at Third Law.
We're currently finishing up everything that will be in the demo for
ECTS.  From what I understand, Gathering isn't showing any of it's products
on the floor at ECTS, so this will be a backroom, press-only showing.
The feedback we received from our E3 demo last May was extremely positive,
with a number of people simply blown away, so we're hoping that the content
we've added to the game since then will be even more impressive.  I must
admit, though, it's easier to impress when you're the underdog.  People
(especially hardcore gamers) tend not to expect much from a KISS game, but
we're pouring our hearts into this and making a game we really want to play.
There should be some more screenshots showing tons of gameplay action
(absolutely real -- no faking here) and a new, improved video showing even
more sometime after ECTS (or perhaps even sooner), so stay tuned -- I think 
some people will be surprised by what they see.
