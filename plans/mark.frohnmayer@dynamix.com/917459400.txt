Well it's been about 6 months since I updated last so I thought
I'd do it again.

We're putting the finishing touches on our first major patch,
dealing mostly with gameplay/interface tweaks and server stability.

it should be available Real Soon Now.  We're working with Riva to
improve the the TNT performance.
