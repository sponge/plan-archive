I'm on vacation! After six years of working at Dynamix with
some incredibly talented and cool people, I need a break -
so I'm off to bum around Europe for the next three months
or so. If you need to get in contact with me, I'll be
checking my GarageGames.com email periodically -
markf@garagegames.com (at least I will when Rick sets up
the mail forwarding - hint, hint...) 

Upon my return I plan on doing some R&D with Tim and Rick
on some next gen networking and game simulation engine
technology, but until then I'm going to try to spend as
little time in front of a computer as I can :)
