============================

GtkRadiant is now available under GPL license, along with some Quake II tools which we never got a chance to put under GPL before. Head over to the qeradiant website [1] for all the details.

I want to personnaly thank everyone who has been contributing to the project over the years, specially Randy Reddig ( ydnar ) and William Joseph ( spog ) for the many hours they've put into this. And thanks for sticking to my word that eventually we were going to be able to place radiant under a more "open" license.

Merry Christmas!

Quake 4 Demo!

The GNU/Linux installer for the Quake 4 demo is on the ftp [1] as well and on the BitTorrent tracker [2].

Note regarding multiplayer that windows clients are able to connect and play on the Linux dedicated server, but Linux clients can only play on Linux servers. Read through the FAQ [3] for details.

============================

We have released the 1.0.4 update for Quake 4. Check our website [1] for all the announcement details. This update is compatible with the current release, but we recommend everyone to upgrade. We also released an SDK so you can start making game modifications. There is also lots of documentation on content creation on the iddevnet website [2].

Now to answer a few frequently asked questions about the GNU/Linux version:

- Linux clients can't play on pure Windows servers 'out of the box'. Even with this update, Windows server still need to put a game pak in their path so Linux clients can join in. This is documented in the Quake 4 GNU/Linux FAQ [3].

- The builtin level editor will not be available on Linux. As was the case with Doom 3, it is too heavily dependent on Windows APIs to be ported. I would advise anyone interested in content creation for Quake 4 on GNU/Linux to help add support in GtkRadiant [4].

some D3 SDK things:
-------------------

Please refer to the documentation after installation for a complete

The Linux update adds support for DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil. See the
Linux FAQ [4] for installation instructions.

The updated SDK also includes game source code for the Resurrection of Evil
expansion pack. New features in 1.3 have been documented in the Linux FAQ [5].

Fixes & Updates in 1.3:
--------------------------
- PunkBuster(TM) support has been added.
- EAX(R) ADVANCED HD(TM) support in the sound engine contributed by Creative
Labs(R). Doom 3 base game comes with room reverb data.
- To utilize EAX(R) ADVANCED HD(TM) in Doom 3, you must have 100% EAX 4.0
compatible sound card.  Please refer to your sound card manufacturer for
details on whether or not your sound card supports EAX 4.0.
- Sound Blaster(R) Audigy(R) 2 users who wish to utilize the new EAX 4.0
feature in Doom 3 should download the latest Creative Beta Drivers for the
card released on April 5th, 2005. Not using these drivers may result in game
instability while using EAX 4.0.
- Server provides .pk4 file download URLs (http/ftp), client has internal
download.
- New class of .pk4 files: 'addon paks' are only referenced when the map is
loaded in.
- .pk4 downloads and addon paks come with a number of fixes to the 'pure
server mode' filesystem code.
- Fixed ragdoll bounciness.
- Fixed how Doom 3 detects LAN client vs. Internet clients.
- LZW compression of render demos.
- Fixed command line parameter passing.
- Added a QuakeIII-style graph of the connection quality for network clients
  controlled with net_clientLagOMeter cvar
  displays a graph of how much the client predicts ahead of the server
  note that you can change the minimum predict ahead of a client by
setting   net_clientPrediction

Changes relevant to mod developers (SDK):

- Added UploadImage to idRenderSystem interface. This lets the user blit
images to the renderer.
- Supports fs_game_base; this lets you base a mod off base game + d3xp +
your own content.
- Most of the download redirection is handled in the game code, and can be
extended.

Linux specific:

- ALSA device opened non-blocking to avoid hangs.

============================

Linux Doom III 1.1.1286 build:

There are new GNU/Linux binaries for Doom3 on the ftp[1] and the BitTorrent tracker[2]. This build is compatible with the previous release, brings a number of bug fixes and new sound code. Alsa[2] and multichannel sound output are now supported.

No GUI changes were made in order to remain compatible with the first release, you will need to set some cvars on the command line to configure your sound:

set s_driver to best, alsa or oss. (best will just try alsa and fallback to OSS otherwise )
set s_numberOfSpeakers to 2 for stereo, 6 for multichannel sound ( whatever your actual number of speakers may be ).

For instance:
doom3 +set s_driver alsa +set s_numberOfSpeakers 6
will start doom3 using the Alsa sound backend in multichannel mode

notes about OSS:

The Linux kernel comes with the OSS/Free API, which works great in most cases but lacks multichannel support. You can download a binary OSS/Linux implementation from 4Front Technologies[4]. To sum up, the drivers are 'free for non commercial use'. You can use them to play Doom III. They have great multichannel support, and that's the drivers I used to develop the OSS backend.

Thanks to everyone who helped testing this build .. and thanks for the positive Linux feedback emails we've been getting..
