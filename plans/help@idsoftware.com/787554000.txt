Status of DOOM---Updated: Fri, Dec 16th 1:50pm

The latest patch for Registered/Shareware DOOM is: 1.2 to 1.666
The latest version of Registered DOOM is: 1.666
The latest version of Shareware/Beta DOOM is: 1.666

The latest patch for DOOM II is: 1.666 to 1.7a

You can find 1.7a at ftp.uwp.edu in:
/pub/incoming/id
THERE WILL BE 1.8 FOR DOOM SOON.
1.8 is it. There will be NO MORE.
**********************

Ensonic is going to put a patch on the Gateway BBS called s2k12__.zip
where the __ is the date in December that they release it. The number
for the BBS is (605) 232-2224.
This will fix the problems with their sound card and make it work
with DOOM/DOOM II.

**********************
The only difference between 1.7 and 1.7a is the tech
support number at the end of the file. You should still upgrade to
1.7a just to make sure you can play with all your friends.
There will be a German and French patch out soon for those of you
that have the foreign version. For those of you who are going to
write me and ask "What's the difference?", they are in a different
language - that's it.

There is a DOOM to DOOM II wad converter.
It is on Compuserve (PWOFORUM/The DOOM Room filename: GATE12.ZIP).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of DOOM II---Updated: Fri, Dec 16th 1:48pm

Out. Finished.

Get version 1.7a.

Status of games using the DOOM engine---updated: Fri, Dec 16th 1:46pm

Heretic: Hmmmm... what to say. We have all been playing this for
the past few weeks and giving feedback to the Raven guys about it.
At this point it is pretty much ready to go, but they have a few
finishing touches to make. As it stands this game is going to blow
you all away. I'll admit at first I was not so impressed, the game
lacked some of the finer details that make DOOM so fun, but now...
some have said it's better than, well... DOOM. The levels are
beautiful, the weapons are awesome, and DeathMatch now has an all
new feeling to it. IT WILL BE OUT WHEN IT'S FINISHED... SHOULD BE
SOON. STOP ASKING!

Strife: Still working. No updates.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of DOOM Movie---Updated Thu, Nov 3rd 1:35pm

Still in the birth process. Many very cool people have shown
interest in the project. There is no release date for the movie.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Mon, Dec 12th 2:07pm

QNX: DOOM for the QNX OS is anonymously ftp'able from quics.qnx.com.
It's compiled with Pentium optimizations and supports sound, music,
the VGA console and X Windows with pixel doubling and tripling.
We don't support this version, QNX Software Systems did the port.
This version will run the shareware, registered, or doom2 wadfile.
The files to ftp are:

  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.pax.gz - Console and X versions of QNX DOOM
  /usr/free/doom/doom1.wad.gz   - DOOM v1.666 wad file
  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.faq    - Installation instructions and other
  details

OS/2: IBM showed a beta version of their port at Comdex, and it
was by all reports quite impressive--fully DIVE-ified (i.e.,
arbitrarily resizable window--including tall-and-skinny or short-
and-fat) and very fast ("DOS speed on the OS/2 desktop").  It
does NOT do 300fps on a 90MHz Pentium as some clown reported, but
it is claimed to be faster than the WinDoom beta.  The unofficial
word from the IBMers was that it would be out around mid-December.

SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag. Do not send
us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

LINUX: the linux version is at:
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/games/x11/action/doom/linxdoom.tgz
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/games/x11/action/doom/doom1wad.tgz
and may be moved to whatever appropriate directory later. Do not
send us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

JAG: It's out now. Go buy it. Everyone likes it.

MAC: We have found a team to do this. There is no release date.
We just got some Power PCs to test the beta
version on. It should be here soon. Please do NOT ask to test
this. There is no more info on this at this time. NO CHANGE.

WINDOWS: We just got a beta of this. Looks AWESOME. Still no
release date. The MICROSOFT guys are working on this. NO CHANGE.

NEXTSTEP: There is a version 1.2 available from cs.orst.edu. There
will not be another patch until we send out the finished version.
Omnigroup is working on a new NEXTSTEP release of
DOOM with interceptor direct framebuffer access, sound,
customizable controls, and lots of other features.
A DOOM II release will also be available.
URL for the info page at Omni's WWW site:
  http://www.omnigroup.com/Software/Doom/

Sega 32X: Released. Everyone is spooging over this one, too.
Buy it.

Ultra 64: This is being worked on. Little info at this time. It
will be a while before you hear anything about this.

There will never be a port to these machines:
Amiga, Sinclair 2000, Apple //gs, TRS-80.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of QUAKE---Updated: Fri, Dec 2nd 2:20pm

This will not be out until sometime next Winter.
Ok, ok... you guys wanted more.
As of today the following things are working/semi-working:
Network play
Basic Engine
Object Modeling
Map Editor
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Network Play:
Server/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on
a NeXT, Linux, or SGI box. Once the server is running you
get on another machine (NeXT, Linux, SGI) and log into the server.
A play window opens and you can see the other players, move around,
quit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but this
will be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc, will
be added in later.

Basic Engine:
This is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,
but this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single
player.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the
engine.

Object Modeling:
Kevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200
polygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we
would need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail
we want. So far this is the only "thing" in the game. He does not
animate, but it is still cool to watch him be "born". At the moment
he is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.

Map Editor:
John also has a map editor in the works. At this point it looks
somewhat like 3D studio, with a camera view and a top down view
of the thing you are working on. You can add and subtract blocks
of "material" from the view. These are the building blocks of the
world... No, you will not be limited to blocks in the finished game.

Read alt.games.quake for occasional new info.
