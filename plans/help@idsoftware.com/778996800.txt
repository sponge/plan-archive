Status of DOOM---Updated: Tue, Sep 7th 7:41pm

The latest patch for Registered/Shareware DOOM is: 1.2 to 1.666
The latest version of Registered DOOM is: 1.666
The latest version of Shareware/Beta DOOM is: 1.666
There will be no 1.7 patch -- 1.666 is the last one.
There is NO version 1.3.

THE PATCH IS OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ftp.uwp.edu /incoming/id is the place to find it now.

We are aware of some of the minor sound bugs. 1.666 is the last
OFFICIAL version of DOOM. We may release some small patches for the
sound code in a few weeks. These will be aimed towards the PAS, Adlib,
and MPU-401 problems. We appreciate bug reports on the experimental
sound fixes, but we cannot promise further tech-support on this.
We are aware of the map bug in 3-9.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of DOOM ][---Updated: Wed, Sep 7th 4:09pm

Finished. Out October 10th. You will also be able to order directly
from us. You can call 1-800-IDGAMES to do this. They cannot take orders
yet. They will be able to in a week or so.
DOOM ][ will be on CD in most stores. The CD will have the shareware
version of DOOM on it. You will be able to play OR install from the CD.

DOOM ][ is not supposed to be on ANYONE'S hard drive right now.
(Unless we GAVE you a copy to test:-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of games using the DOOM engine---updated Thu, Sep 1st 11:24am

Heretic: Will be out November 1st. Wizards, magic weapons, and flying.
Multi-player support will still be in this. There will also be a look
up, look down feature. Being done by Raven Software.

Strife: There is no release date. Probably out in January. Mini rocket
launchers, plasma rifles, and talking characters. Multi-play will not
be supported. Look up, look down feature. Being done by Cygnus Software.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Thu, Sep 8th 12:20am

OS/2: Still working, no dates yet. IBM guys are handling this.
This is how this will work: You will be able to download the
OS/2 version from most BBSs and ftp sites. It will work with
your registered wad or the shareware one. NO CHANGE.

SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag.

LINUX: the linux version is at sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/Incoming
and may be moved to whatever appropriate directory later. Do not
send us mail about this. We will delete it.

JAG: Running very fast. We are doing this port in-house. Maps are
being worked on now. They will be the same maps. This is very
close to being finished. Out before Christmas.

MAC: We have found a team to do this. There is no release date. No
development has begun. We just got some Power PCs to test the beta
version on. It should be here soon. Please do NOT ask to test
this. There is no more info on this at this time. NO CHANGE.

WINDOWS: We just got a beta of this. Looks AWESOME. Still no
release date. The MICROSOFT guys are working on this.

NEXTSTEP: There is a version 1.2 available from cs.orst.edu. There
will be a ver 1.666 available there as soon as we release the patch for
the DOS version. Omnigroup is working on a new NEXTSTEP release of
DOOM with interceptor direct framebuffer access, sound,
customizable controls, and lots of other features.
A DOOM II release will also be available.

Sega 32X: Like the Jag version. Sega is doing this one. Close to
being finished. No release date.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.

Status of QUAKE---Updated: Thu, Sep 1st 11:41am

This will not be out until sometime next summer.
John now has a simple (slow) engine running. It uses converted
DOOM maps and runs them with flats for textures. It looks REALLY
cool.
Ok, imagine this. You have a health thing and you don't need it.
You meet someone in the game who has a nice weapon but is really
low on health. You guys decide to exchange items. You don't really
trust this guy so you bring along a friend and tell him to hide out
somewhere with a bead on the other guy's head. You meet somewhere
in the middle of a field and face off. You drop your health, he drops
his weapon and you both strafe over the object of your desire. You
start to back away (not turning your back on him) and suddenly decide
you're going to whack this guy before he gets a chance to use that
health. You move towards him and draw back with your hammer. He notices
this and starts to duck, but it's too late. You smash him in the head
and watch him fly down to the ground, landing on his side. You smash
his still body a few more times and cause him to explode! Now you and
your friend pick up all of the items your dead friend left on the
ground. As you are walking off you pick up his severed head and put
it in a bag. That will come in useful later... when you need something
to sacrifice to a demon.

If you have DOS ver 6.x do this--

Restart the computer
When you see the STARTING MS-DOS message hold down a SHIFT key
Wait until a C: prompt appears
Let go of the SHIFT key
Run the game.

If you have DOS 5.x or earlier(retch)--

Put a BLANK disk in the A: drive.
At the C: prompt type FORMAT A:/S and hit ENTER
When the disk is finished being formatted restart the computer.
Run the game.

If this does not work you may not have enough memory.
Run MEM and see what it reports. You need at least 3.3 MB TOTAL MEMORY
