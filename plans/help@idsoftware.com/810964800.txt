> I heard on the Newsgroup that John Romero was in a car accident?
> Is he OK?

John was speeding down the highway in his Ferrari when he hit a Volkswagen
bus full of Iranian terrorists. Unfortunately, the bus was also full of
high explosives which they were planning on using to blow up a Kwiky Mart
where some "Haqeem Jafaar" (leader of the underground Iranian Michael
Jackson fan club) was working. The bus exploded, taking John, John's car,
and three surrounding city blocks with it. The terrorists escaped unharmed
and spent the night in jail. Since they killed John, we decided to hire
them to replace him. So far we are having a hard time talking to them and
they keep demanding that we wear blindfolds and get down on our knees...
I think by the end of the week we will have them up to speed though.

Status of QUAKE---Updated: Tue, Aug 29 at 11:47pm

Please do not send us mail about Quake. It just slows us down.
Thanks.

Well, we just got sprite 'models' animating with frame changes and rotational
changes totally moved over to the client. The server is runnin' really well
now!  There's a really cool Pain Barrier (and Health Field) that just looks
great with animating and rotating sprites. Um, and yes, there are sprites in
the game - for very good reason: there's not an amazing level of detail to
be had in a total polygon environment.  Sprites are faster to render and
besides, they make great torch holders!  They also look cool for magical
effects!

Programming the entities in the game is one of the most amazing and
rewarding parts of Quake development.  You program in Quake-C (.qc) and the
instant you save your file, you tell Quake to reload and parse it. It
takes about 1 second.  Then, you get to see your changes implemented right
then - and that's while you're programming in a C-like language! No compiler
in the middle; instant execution.  Too cool for words.

There. I just wanted to add something new for QuakeTalk. :)

You can find screenshots of some of our Quake stuff
on ftp.idsoftware.com in /idstuff/quake. The file is quakepix.zip.
By the way, Quake is an action game, not an RPG.

********
THERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*!
THERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST EITHER.
WE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.
********

This will not be out until sometime around this Christmas.

Things that work:
network play, mouse control
sprite engine, sound, entity programming
polygon engine, map editor

Things we are working on:
speed, speed, monsters, speed, maps
sound effects w/help from Trent:)
and a lot more.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Network Play:
Server/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on
a DOS, NeXT, Linux, or SGI etc... box. Once the server is running you
get on another machine (DOS, NeXT, Linux, SGI, etc) and log into the
server. A play window opens and you can see the other players, move
around, quit out, get back in, etc... Deathmatch is working a little
now and we can run around and shoot each other with fireballs.

Engine:
This is running very fast. We have completed some really great
looking levels that we are running around in. The lighting is
too good to believe. There are doors/plats/switches/etc... in
the game now.

Object Modeling:
Kevin is working on creating the monsters/players and Michael
is making them draw really fast. These are looking great. Sprites
suck compared to proper models.

Map Editor:
The map editor is completely finished. We have been working with
it for a while now, creating new levels.

Please do not send us mail about Quake. It just slows us down.
Thanks.

Status of games using the DOOM engine---Updated: Wed, Sep 13th, 2:27pm

HEXEN: Beyond Heretic -- Almost in Beta. This game ROCKS!

Strife:  An action / R.P.G. where medieval and high technologies
meld to form a world where warfare and oppression are a way of life.

an end. This is where you begin your journey through Strife.

What's working now: Level to level warping, Jumping, looking up and
down, Player stats, translucent mid textures, network and deathmatch
play, NPC conversation, inventory,  new actors, plot.

What we're working on:  New deathmatch stuff, world state save games,
scripting the registered levels, sound and music.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Mon, Sep 4th, 12:00pm

Sony Playstation DOOM: In final Beta right now. This is the best version
of DOOM we've ever seen. There's ALL-NEW music and sound effects, colored
lighting in many areas, lots of echo and reverb and a generally more
creepy feeling while playing the game. This version is basically DOOM and
DOOM II all rolled into one!  Should be available this Fall.

MAC: MacDOOM II is out now. Lion Entertainment is working on The Ultimate
MacDOOM right now.  No release date yet, but we'll release a shareware
version of MacDOOM as soon as it's done.

WIN95: This is either finished or almost finished.  We saw an almost-final
version of Win95-DOOM a couple months ago, so it should be done by now.

WINDOWS: There will be NO Windows 3.1 version of DOOM.

Old news
------------------------------------------------------------------

for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag. Do not send
us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

Sun Solaris 2.4: ftp.idsoftware.com:/new/sundoom.tar.gz.  Same as
SGI but uses direct frame buffer access for faster blitting.  Do

QNX: DOOM for the QNX OS is anonymously ftp'able from quics.qnx.com.
It's compiled with Pentium optimizations and supports sound, music,
the VGA console and X Windows with pixel doubling and tripling.
We don't support this version, QNX Software Systems did the port.
This version will run the shareware, registered, or doom2 wadfile.
The files to ftp are:

  details

Ultra 64: We have licensed Williams Entertainment to develop a
unique version of DOOM for Nintendo's U-64.  It is to be available
for the consumer release of the platform.

doesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.
