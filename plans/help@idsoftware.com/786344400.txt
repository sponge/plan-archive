Status of games using the DOOM engine---updated: Fri, Dec 2nd 12:58

Heretic: You are running around in a DeathMatch with some ass chasing
you with the Phoenix Rod (bad). You run across the Morph Ovum and pick
it up. You let your "friend" follow you a little longer and then you
turn around and use the Morph on him... Four little "eggs" fly out
and a few hit him. He squawks and hits the floor as a chicken.
Now he has no weapon (except that wimpy beak) and all you have to do
is catch him, pop him with your Dragon Claw a few times and watch
the feathers fly. You've never seen your friends so mad at being
killed by you until you turn them into a chicken and make them
die in a puff of feathers hehe... The game should be out in two weeks.

Status of QUAKE---Updated: Fri, Dec 2nd 2:20pm

This will not be out until sometime next Winter.
Ok, ok... you guys wanted more.
As of today the following things are working/semi-working:
Network play
Basic Engine
Object Modeling
Map Editor
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Network Play:
Server/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on
a NeXT, Linux, or SGI box. Once the server is running you
get on another machine (NeXT, Linux, SGI) and log into the server.
A play window opens and you can see the other players, move around,
quit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but this
will be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc, will
be added in later.

Basic Engine:
This is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,
but this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single
player.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the
engine.

Object Modeling:
Kevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200
polygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we
would need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail
we want. So far this is the only "thing" in the game. He does not
animate, but it is still cool to watch him be "born". At the moment
he is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.

Map Editor:
John also has a map editor in the works. At this point it looks
somewhat like 3D studio, with a camera view and a top down view
of the thing you are working on. You can add and subtract blocks
of "material" from the view. These are the building blocks of the
world... No, you will not be limited to blocks in the finished game.

All of this will come together very soon to create one of the most
awesome network/3D games in the world... if not the most awesome
(Ok, who are we kidding? It will be the most awesome hehe.)
