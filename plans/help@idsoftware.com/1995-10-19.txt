Status of QUAKE---Updated: Tue, Aug 29 at 11:47pm

Please do not send us mail about Quake. It just slows us down.
Thanks.

****
You can find screenshots of some of our Quake stuff
on ftp.idsoftware.com in /idstuff/quake. The file is quakepix.zip.
By the way, Quake is an action game, not an RPG.

Carmack just finished changing over the structure/compiler for
the Quake interpreted language. It needed to be optimized. We
spent some time changing our old code over, and now things
are working great again.
We have two functioning monsters in right now. One is the
knight that you saw in the screen shots and the other is an
ogre that just got finished. The knight chases you around and
slashes at you with his sword and the ogre has a huge axe and
a missile attack. Both of these monsters look extremely cool.
The artists are currently working on new monsters and on
some nice demonic textures for the game. We are starting to
get some of the really disturbing art in now... makes DOOM
look like a place to take children instead of the zoo:)
Some misc. things we have been working on: some changes to
lighting, network code, getting the game running on some
accelerator boards, getting new monsters in, working on environmental
hazards, levels, etc... etc...

This will not be out until sometime around this Christmas.

Things that work:
network play, mouse control, lighting,
sprite engine, sound, entity programming,
polygon engine, map editor

Things we are working on:
speed, speed, monsters, speed, maps
sound effects w/help from Trent
and a lot more.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Network Play:
Server/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on
a DOS, NeXT, Linux, or SGI etc... box. Once the server is running you
get on another machine (DOS, NeXT, Linux, SGI, etc) and log into the
server. A play window opens and you can see the other players, move
around, quit out, get back in, etc... Deathmatch is working a little
now and we can run around and shoot each other with fireballs.

Engine:
This is running very fast. We have completed some really great
looking levels that we are running around in. The lighting is
too good to believe. There are doors/plats/switches/etc... in
the game now.

Object Modeling:
Kevin is working on creating the monsters/players and Michael
is making them draw really fast. These are looking great. Sprites
suck compared to proper models.

Map Editor:
The map editor is completely finished. We have been working with
it for a while now, creating new levels.

Please do not send us mail about Quake. It just slows us down.
Thanks.

Read alt.games.quake for occasional new info.

THERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*!
THERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST EITHER.
WE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.

Status of DOOM---Updated: Fri, Jul 28th 3:22pm

We have mastered The Ultimate DOOM! *This is out in stores now*.
There is a patch for registered DOOM owners that will turn your
DOOM into Ultimate DOOM for free. You can find it on ftp.idsoftware.com.

DOOM/DOOM II:
GET VERSION 1.9 FROM ftp.idsoftware.com

The latest patch for Registered/Shareware DOOM is: 1.7 to 1.9
The latest version of Registered DOOM is: 1.9
The latest version of Shareware/Beta DOOM is: 1.9

The latest patch for DOOM II is: 1.7a to 1.9

1.9 is it. There will be NO MORE.

If you have a version of DOOM II dated 8-25 it is pirated.
Do NOT write us asking how to patch it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Status of games using the DOOM engine---Updated: Wed, Sep 13th, 2:27pm

HEXEN: Beyond Heretic -- Almost in Beta. This game ROCKS!
We will not have 8 player network support in this game
when it comes out. It *will* be added in soon after it
has been released though. (I just verified this for those
of you who thought you heard differently. It is true.)

Strife:  An action / R.P.G. where medieval and high technologies
meld to form a world where warfare and oppression are a way of life.
An underground rebellion, the Movement, is this world's slim hope
for change.  Your wish is to join them and bring the tyranny to
an end. This is where you begin your journey through Strife.

What's working now: Level to level warping, Jumping, looking up and
down, Player stats, translucent mid textures, network and deathmatch
play, NPC conversation, inventory,  new actors, plot.

What we're working on:  New deathmatch stuff, world state save games,
scripting the registered levels, sound and music.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Mon, Sep 4th, 12:00pm

Sony Playstation DOOM: In final Beta right now. This is the best version
of DOOM we've ever seen. There's ALL-NEW music and sound effects, colored
lighting in many areas, lots of echo and reverb and a generally more
creepy feeling while playing the game. This version is basically DOOM and
DOOM II all rolled into one!  Should be available this Fall.

MAC:  MacDOOM II is out in stores now.  The shareware version of DOOM I
is available now.  You can find it on any InfoMac mirror site (there's
over 30 of them).  Here are some you can try:

ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/_Game/_Arcade/doom-i-101.hqx
ftp://ftp.delphi.com/pub/mirrors/info-mac/_Game/_Arcade/doom-i-101.hqx
http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Archive/game/arc/doom-i-101.hqx
http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/mac/info-mac/_Game/_Arcade/doom-i-101.hqx

WIN95: This is either finished or almost finished.  We saw an almost-final
version of Win95-DOOM a couple months ago, so it should be done by now.

WINDOWS: There will be NO Windows 3.1 version of DOOM.

Old news
------------------------------------------------------------------
SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag. Do not send
us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

Sun Solaris 2.4: ftp.idsoftware.com:/new/sundoom.tar.gz.  Same as
SGI but uses direct frame buffer access for faster blitting.  Do
not send us mail about this port. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

LINUX: the linux version is at:
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/linuxsdoom.tar.gz  (full-screen)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/linuxxdoom.tar.gz  (X windows)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/sndserver.gz       (bug fixed)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/doom1v18.wad.gz
and may be moved to whatever appropriate directory later. Do not
send us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

QNX: DOOM for the QNX OS is anonymously ftp'able from quics.qnx.com.
It's compiled with Pentium optimizations and supports sound, music,
the VGA console and X Windows with pixel doubling and tripling.
We don't support this version, QNX Software Systems did the port.
This version will run the shareware, registered, or doom2 wadfile.
The files to ftp are:

  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.pax.gz - Console and X versions of QNX DOOM
  /usr/free/doom/doom1.wad.gz   - DOOM v1.666 wad file
  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.faq    - Installation instructions and other
  details

NEXTSTEP: URL for the info page at Omni's WWW site:
  http://www.omnigroup.com/Software/Doom/
There is a DOOM and a DOOM II beta version.
If you have any other questions about Doom (under NEXTSTEP),
contact doom@omnigroup.com .

OS/2: Still waiting. There is no new info. I wish there was. Do not
send us mail about this.

JAG: It's out now. Go buy it. Everyone likes it.

Sega 32X: Released. Buy it.

Ultra 64: We have licensed Williams Entertainment to develop a
unique version of DOOM for Nintendo's U-64.  It is to be available
for the consumer release of the platform.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.
