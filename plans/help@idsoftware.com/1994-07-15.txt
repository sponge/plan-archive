TEST THIS!!!

>>>1.5 Beta has been released.

Ok, there are still some bugs in the sound code of 1.5:( As soon
as these are worked out we will have a patch for everyone. We may
just release a patch anyway. We know that everyone is getting tired
of the wait. It should not be too long before I post something more
solid here.  It looks like we are going to be up to a ver 1.6 (or
1.7) before this is all finished.

> It looks like it will be sometime next week before we release anything
> new.

Status of DOOM ][---Updated: Fri, July 15th 11:45am

There are now about 32 levels finished.

The new monsters are great. The Archvile (the guy who BFGs you and
walks around waking up the dead) is working great. When he walks
over someone he makes this wonderful backwards gibs sound and they
leap up from the ground. Another new monster, The Undead, shoots
homing rockets out at you. These move a little slower than normal
rockets, and have no blast radius. If there are two of these guys
after you, you don't have much of a chance of living.

DOOM ][ will be available from a store near you in October.

Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Fri, July 15th, 5:06pm

OS/2: Still working, no dates yet. IBM guys are handling this. NO CHANGE.

SGI Irix v5.2:  Done.  Dave will be demonstrating it at SIGGRAPH.
It will be released soon afterwards and included on the next IndyZone
CDROM.  It is integrated with the latest DOOM versions and will be
virtually identical to the Linux version.  It supports pixel-doubling,
-tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound for clearer mixing.

LINUX: Same as Irix version.  Out later, though.

JAG: Running very fast. Lighting is working now. This will be out
later this summer. We are doing this. There will be two new levels
in the Jag version. I am working on these next week. The graphics
are getting faster every day.

MAC: We have found a team to do this. There is no release date. No
development has begun. NO CHANGE.

WINDOWS: Still working, no dates yet. Microsoft guys are handling
this. NO CHANGE.

NeXT: There is a version 1.2 available from cs.orst.edu. There will
be a ver 1.6 available there as soon as we release the patch for
the DOS version. NO CHANGE.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one.

Status of QUAKE---Updated: Fri, July 8th 12:50am

This will not be out until sometime next summer.
John Carmack is currently designing the engine.
You think DeathMatch is fun??
Wait till you enter Quake with ten of your buddies and go after one
REALLY BIG, REALLY MEAN Romero type guy. This will be fun.

WHAT IS iD?

1id \'id\ n

:the one of the three divisions of the psyche in psychoanalytic
theory that is completely unconscious and is the source of psychic
energy derived from instinctual needs and drives P compare EGO,

DOOM SAYS INSUFFICIENT DPMI MEMORY! WHAT DO I DO??

If you have DOS ver 6.x do this--

Restart the computer
When you see the STARTING MS-DOS message hold down a SHIFT key
Wait until a C: prompt appears
Let go of the SHIFT key
Run the game.

If you have DOS 5.x or earlier(wretch)--

Put a BLANK disk in the A: drive.
At the C: prompt type FORMAT A:/S and hit ENTER
When the disk is finished being formatted restart the computer.
Run the game.

If this does not work you may not have enough memory.
Run MEM and see what it reports. You need at least 3.3 MB TOTAL MEMORY
FREE.

WHEN TRYING TO RUN A MODEM GAME THE MODEM JUST SITS THERE.
IT NEVER EVEN DIALS OUT. NOW WHAT??

The SerSetup program initializes the modem too quickly. You will
need to initialize the modem from the DOS prompt like this:

ECHO AT Z M1 blah blah > COMx

This will initialize the modem... you may get an error and an
'ABORT, RETRY, FAIL' message... just keep RETRYing until it takes
it. (If your friend has this problem he/she needs to do the same)
Then do this:

ECHO ATDT 555-2222 > COMx

This will dial out to your friend. At your friends house he/she
needs to do this:

ECHO ATS0=1

This will set him/her up for an auto-answer. When the phone rings
and the modems connect, you both need to go into SETUP and select
ALREADY CONNECTED. That's all there is to it.

I RUN THE GAME AND AFTER A WHILE MY GUY GOES NUTS. HE SPINS AROUND
AND SHOOTS LIKE HE'S ON ACID OR SOMETHING. WHAT GIVES?? HAS HE GONE
BLIND?!

This is a bug in the software. There will be a patch out soon. This
problem arises using a PS/2 style mouse and some keyboards. You
can use the keyboard only or use a serial mouse until the patch is
out. The patch will be sent to all registered users. You will also
be able to D/L the patch from most ftp sites and BBS's.
