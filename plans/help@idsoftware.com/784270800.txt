Status of DOOM---Updated: Sat, Oct 29th 4:14pm

The latest patch for Registered/Shareware DOOM is: 1.2 to 1.666
The latest version of Registered DOOM is: 1.666
The latest version of Shareware/Beta DOOM is: 1.666
There is NO version 1.3.

You can find 1.666 at ftp.uwp.edu in:
/pub/incoming/id

We are aware of some the minor sound bugs. 1.666 is the last
OFFICIAL version of DOOM. We may release some small patches for the
sound code in a few weeks. These will be aimed towards the PAS, Adlib,
and MPU-401 problems. We appreciate bug reports on the experimental
sound fixes, but we cannot promise further tech-support on this.
We are aware of the map bug in 3-9.

There will be a ver 1.7 for DOOM and DOOM ][. These should be out
soon. These patches will fix map bugs, and some sound code problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of DOOM ][---Updated: Nov 8th 5:58pm

Out. Finished.

WE ARE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE PATCHES. THERE ARE _THREE_
DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF DOOM ][ OUT RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE TWO 1.666'S
AND A 1.7. THE TWO 1.666'S DO NOT APPEAR TO BE DIFFERENT AT STARTUP
BUT THEY WILL HAVE DIFFERENT FILE CREATION DATES. WHAT WE ARE WORKING
ON NOW IS ONE PATCH THAT WILL WORK ON ALL THREE VERSIONS. THIS SHOULD
BE OUT SOON. IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE PATCHES PLEASE
DO NOT MAIL US. WE ARE AWARE OF THIS. WE ARE WORKING TO FIX IT.
THERE SHOULD BE A NEW PATCH OUT NOV 11TH.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE TO GT CUSTOMERS:
We are aware of how shitty GT has been to some of you guys. We have
jumped all over them and made them cry. They should be contacting
you with an apology and some sort of gift for getting the shaft.
We realize how mad you are at them and we understand. Steps _are_ being
taken to make sure this never happens again. We appreciate the support
of everyone who buys our products.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of games using the DOOM engine---updated Sat, Oct 29th 4:18pm

Heretic: Won't be out Nov 1st. Wizards, magic weapons, and flying.
Multi-player support will still be in this. We have been testing this.
The multi-player is VERY cool. You can fly around the other guy and
shoot him from the air... The maps are very slick and the monsters
are very cool. There are some great weapons in the game also.
Will be out before Christmas.

Strife: Still working. No updates.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of DOOM Movie---Updated Thu, Nov 3rd 1:35pm

Still in the birth process. Many very cool people have shown
interest in the project. There is no release date for the movie.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Sat, Oct 29th 4:19pm

QNX: DOOM for the QNX OS is anonymously ftp'able from quics.qnx.com.
It's compiled with Pentium optimizations and supports sound, music,
the VGA console and X Windows with pixel doubling and tripling.
We don't support this version, QNX Software Systems did the port.
This version will run the shareware, registered, or doom2 wadfile.
The files to ftp are:


  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.pax.gz - Console and X versions of QNX DOOM
  /usr/free/doom/doom1.wad.gz   - DOOM v1.666 wad file
  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.faq    - Installation instructions and other details


OS/2: Still working, no dates yet. IBM guys are handling this.
This is how this will work: You will be able to download the
OS/2 version from most BBSs and ftp sites. It will work with
your registered wad or the shareware one. NO CHANGE. STILL NO CHANGE.

SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag. Do not send
us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

LINUX: the linux version is at sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/Incoming
and may be moved to whatever appropriate directory later. Do not
send us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

JAG: This is finished. It is being mastered. Will be out before
Christmas. Mutli-player works between two Jags in the same room.
NO CHANGE.

MAC: We have found a team to do this. There is no release date.
We just got some Power PCs to test the beta
version on. It should be here soon. Please do NOT ask to test
this. There is no more info on this at this time. NO CHANGE.

WINDOWS: We just got a beta of this. Looks AWESOME. Still no
release date. The MICROSOFT guys are working on this. NO CHANGE.

NEXTSTEP: There is a version 1.2 available from cs.orst.edu. There
will not be another patch until we send out the finished version.
Omnigroup is working on a new NEXTSTEP release of
DOOM with interceptor direct framebuffer access, sound,
customizable controls, and lots of other features.
A DOOM II release will also be available.
URL for the info page at Omni's WWW site:
  http://www.omnigroup.com/Software/Doom/

Sega 32X: Like the Jag version. Sega is doing this one. Close to
being finished. No release date. Maps are finished. NO CHANGE.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.

Status of QUAKE---Updated: Sat, Oct 29th 4:21pm

This will not be out until sometime next summer.
John now has a simple (slow) engine running. It uses converted
DOOM maps and runs them with flats for textures. It looks REALLY
cool.
Ok, imagine this. You have a health thing and you don't need it.
You meet someone in the game who has a nice weapon but is really
low on health. You guys decide to exchange items. You don't really
trust this guy so you bring along a friend and tell him to hide out
somewhere with a bead on the other guy's head. You meet somewhere
in the middle of a field and face off. You drop your health, he drops
his weapon and you both strafe over the object of your desire. You
start to back away (not turning your back on him) and suddenly decide
you're going to whack this guy before he gets a chance to use that
health. You move towards him and draw back with your hammer. He notices
this and starts to duck, but it's too late. You smash him in the head
and watch him fly down to the ground, landing on his side. You smash
his still body a few more times and cause him to explode! Now you and
your friend pick up all of the items your dead friend left on the
ground. As you are walking off you pick up his severed head and put
it in a bag. That will come in useful later... when you need something
to sacrifice to a demon.

John has a faster engine working now. Groundwork for network play
has been finished. Looking VERY cool. For those of you who still
have a wife, kids, a job, and a life after DOOM, this game is for YOU.
You DOOM junkies will have a new fix...
