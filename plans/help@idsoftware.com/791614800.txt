Still in the birth process. Many very cool people have shown
interest in the project. There is no release date for the movie.
Nothing new.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Mon, Dec 12th 2:07pm

QNX: DOOM for the QNX OS is anonymously ftp'able from quics.qnx.com.
It's compiled with Pentium optimizations and supports sound, music,
the VGA console and X Windows with pixel doubling and tripling.
We don't support this version, QNX Software Systems did the port.
This version will run the shareware, registered, or doom2 wadfile.
The files to ftp are:

  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.pax.gz - Console and X versions of QNX DOOM
  /usr/free/doom/doom1.wad.gz   - DOOM v1.666 wad file
  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.faq    - Installation instructions and other
  details

OS/2: IBM showed a beta version of their port at Comdex, and it
was by all reports quite impressive--fully DIVE-ified (i.e.,
arbitrarily resizable window--including tall-and-skinny or short-
and-fat) and very fast ("DOS speed on the OS/2 desktop").  It
does NOT do 300fps on a 90MHz Pentium as some clown reported, but
it is claimed to be faster than the WinDoom beta. Still not finished.
I will be checking for more info soon. NO release date yet.

SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag. Do not send
us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

Sun Solaris 2.4: ftp.idsoftware.com:/new/sundoom.tar.gz.  Same as
SGI but uses direct frame buffer access for faster blitting.  Do
not send us mail about this port.  We will delete it.

LINUX: the linux version is at:
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/games/x11/action/doom/linxdoom.tgz
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/games/x11/action/doom/doom1wad.tgz
and may be moved to whatever appropriate directory later. Do not
send us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

MAC: We have found a team to do this. There is no release date.
We just got some Power PCs to test the beta
version on. It should be here soon. Please do NOT ask to test
this. There is no more info on this at this time. NO CHANGE.

WINDOWS: We just got a beta of this. Looks AWESOME. Still no
release date. The MICROSOFT guys are working on this. NO CHANGE.

NEXTSTEP: There is a version 1.2 available from cs.orst.edu. There
will not be another patch until we send out the finished version.
Omnigroup is working on a new NEXTSTEP release of
DOOM with interceptor direct framebuffer access, sound,
customizable controls, and lots of other features.
A DOOM II release will also be available.
URL for the info page at Omni's WWW site:
  http://www.omnigroup.com/Software/Doom/

JAG: It's out now. Go buy it. Everyone likes it.

Sega 32X: Released. Everyone is spooging over this one, too.
Buy it.

Ultra 64: This is being worked on. Little info at this time. It
will be a while before you hear anything about this.

There will never be a port to these machines:
Amiga, Sinclair 2000, Apple //gs, TRS-80.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of QUAKE---Updated: Tue, Jan 24th 8:48pm

********
THERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*
THERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST RIGHT NOW EITHER
WE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT
********

This will not be out until sometime next Winter.
Ok, ok... you guys wanted more.
As of today the following things are working/semi-working:
Network play
Basic Engine
Object Modeling
Map Editor
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Network Play:
Server/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on
a NeXT, Linux, or SGI box. Once the server is running you
get on another machine (NeXT, Linux, SGI) and log into the server.
A play window opens and you can see the other players, move around,
quit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but this
will be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc, will
be added in later.

Basic Engine:
This is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,
but this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single
player.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the
engine.

Object Modeling:
Kevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200
polygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we
would need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail
we want. So far this is the only "thing" in the game. He does not
animate, but it is still cool to watch him be "born". At the moment
he is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.

Map Editor:
John also has a map editor in the works. At this point it looks
somewhat like 3D studio, with a camera view and a top down view
of the thing you are working on. You can add and subtract blocks
of "material" from the view. These are the building blocks of the
world... No, you will not be limited to blocks in the finished game.

**We will not be adding anything new to this for a while.
There are MANY cool new things going into the game right now, but
we do not want to give it all away just yet. We have been creating
small test levels for the past few weeks, and these are looking
awesome. The general game idea has started to solidify, but please
do not write asking what it is.
I will add some new stuff here when there is *alot* more to add.

Read alt.games.quake for occasional new info.

DOOM IS DOING SOME WIERD LOCK-UP THING! I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING
ELSE! NOW WHAT?!

CMOS settings: Disable VIDEO SHADOW, HIDDEN REFRESH, & TURBO SWITCHING.
Enable: HD1 BLOCK MODE.

Video Cards: Diamond SpeedStar: Disable ZERO WAIT STATE.

Set your bus speed to the slowest setting in your CMOS settings.

ROM Shadow inable at $CA00

If your SB16 is freaking out you might try this:
Load the 'CTSB16.SYS' DOS driver for the card.

AST Machines: Either put more memory in it, or on the EMM386 line in
your CONFIG.SYS add: x=c000-cfff.

DOOM SAYS INSUFFICIENT DPMI MEMORY! WHAT DO I DO??

If you have DOS ver 6.x do this--

Restart the computer
When you see the STARTING MS-DOS message hold down a SHIFT key
Wait until a C: prompt appears
Let go of the SHIFT key
Run the game.

If you have DOS 5.x or earlier(retch)--

Put a BLANK disk in the A: drive.
At the C: prompt type FORMAT A:/S and hit ENTER
When the disk is finished being formatted restart the computer.
Run the game.

If this does not work you may not have enough memory.
Run MEM and see what it reports. You need at least 3.3 MB TOTAL MEMORY
FREE.
