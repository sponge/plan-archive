Status of DOOM ][---Updated: Wed, Aug 3rd 1:27pm

There are now about 32 levels finished.

The new monsters are great. The Archvile (the guy who BFGs you and
walks around waking up the dead) is working great. When he walks
over someone he makes this wonderful backwards gibs sound and they
leap up from the ground.

DOOM ][ will be available from a store near you in October.
You do not receive a discount for being a registered user.

Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Tue, Aug 9th 11:55am

OS/2: Still working, no dates yet. IBM guys are handling this.
This is how this will work: You will be able to download the
OS/2 version from most BBSs and ftp sites. It will work with
your registered wad or the shareware one. NO CHANGE.

SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag.

LINUX: Same as Irix version. Not finished yet. Out later, though.
This will also be available from most ftp sites.

JAG: Running very fast. Lighting is working now. This will be out
later this summer probably September. We are doing this. There
will be two new levels in the Jag version. The graphics are
getting faster every day.

MAC: We have found a team to do this. There is no release date. No
development has begun. We just got some Power PCs to test the beta
version on. It should be here soon. Please do NOT ask to test
this. There is no more info on this at this time. NO CHANGE.

WINDOWS: We just got a beta of this. Looks AWESOME. Still no release
date. The MICROSOFT guys are working on this.

NEXTSTEP: There is a version 1.2 available from cs.orst.edu. There will
be a ver 1.6 available there as soon as we release the patch for
the DOS version. This will be out next in-house port. Dave will be
doing this and it will have sound when it's done, just like the SGI version.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one. Please do not send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of QUAKE---Updated: Tue, Aug 9th 11:38am

This will not be out until sometime next summer.
John now has a simple (slow) engine running. It uses converted
DOOM maps and runs them with flats for textures. It looks REALLY
cool.
Multi-player should go something like this:
Someone owns a fast server somewhere. You dial in and join the
game in progress. Ten or more people at a time can be in the world.
You will not NEED a Pentium to play QUAKE. Everyone knows you don't
need one for DOOM either... but it doesn't hurt anything.

Status of Ferraris---Updated Tue, Aug 9th 11:39am
(Don't blame me.  Y'all told us to write this.)

This seems to change more than anything... I guess I'll keep
track of it here.

Who owns what: John Carmack has a 1985 328GTS and a 1988 Testarossa.
Both of these are red. John Romero has a 1991 Testarossa. This is
a cool yellow color.

Carmack's 328GTS has one turbo running from 10-15 pounds of boost.
This car has about 500hp. This is a very fast car.
His Testarossa just had a turbo death job done on it. It now has
TWO turbos, dual intercooling, and an all new engine control system.
The TR produces from 700-800hp. This car makes the 328 feel slow.

Romero has not done anything special to his TR. It is a cool yellow
though.

Aug 8th. While showing Shawn what REAL speed is Carmack breaks the
input shaft on his TR. Back to the shop.

For those who care:
Sandy Peterson drives a 1985 Honda Civic 4 door... badly hail damaged.
Shawn Green drives a 1983 Camaro soon to be a 3000GT VR4.
American McGee drives a 1990 Honda CRX soon to be a 230hp turbo
death Honda!!
Adrian Carmack drives a Viper. Black. Nice.
Kevin Cloud drives a 1993 Vette.
Dave Taylor drives a 1985 Jag XJS with a Vette engine in it.
Jay Wilbur drives a 1985 Toyota Celica.
Donna Jackson drives a 1990 Mustang 5.0.

DOOM SAYS INSUFFICIENT DPMI MEMORY! WHAT DO I DO??

If you have DOS ver 6.x do this--

Restart the computer
When you see the STARTING MS-DOS message hold down a SHIFT key
Wait until a C: prompt appears
Let go of the SHIFT key
Run the game.

If you have DOS 5.x or earlier(wretch)--

Put a BLANK disk in the A: drive.
At the C: prompt type FORMAT A:/S and hit ENTER
When the disk is finished being formatted restart the computer.
Run the game.

If this does not work you may not have enough memory.
Run MEM and see what it reports. You need at least 3.3 MB TOTAL MEMORY
FREE.

WHEN TRYING TO RUN A MODEM GAME THE MODEM JUST SITS THERE.
IT NEVER EVEN DIALS OUT. NOW WHAT??

The SerSetup program initializes the modem too quickly.
You will need to initialize the modem from the DOS prompt like this:

ECHO AT Z M1 blah blah > COMx

This will initialize the modem... you may get an error and an
'ABORT, RETRY, FAIL' message... just keep RETRYing until it takes it.
(If your friend has this problem he/she needs to do the same) Then do this:

ECHO ATDT 555-2222 > COMx

This will dial out to your friend. At your friends house he/she needs
to do this:

ECHO ATS0=1

This will set him/her up for an auto-answer. When the phone rings and
the modems connect, you both need to go into SETUP and select
ALREADY CONNECTED. That's all there is to it.

I RUN THE GAME AND AFTER A WHILE MY GUY GOES NUTS. HE SPINS AROUND
AND SHOOTS LIKE HE'S ON ACID OR SOMETHING. WHAT GIVES?? HAS HE GONE
BLIND?!

This is a bug in the software. There will be a patch out soon. This
problem arises using a PS/2 style mouse and some keyboards. You
can use the keyboard only or use a serial mouse until the patch is
out. The patch will be sent to all registered users. You will also
be able to D/L the patch from most ftp sites and BBS's.
