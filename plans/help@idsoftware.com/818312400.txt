Status of QUAKE---Updated: Tue, Dec 6th 2:21pm

You can find screenshots of some of our Quake stuff
on ftp.idsoftware.com in /idstuff/quake.

This is too much. I really want to answer all the
questions you people are sending... but there are
too many. Since I started this thing I have recieved
over 350+ pieces of mail... 10 more while I am writing
this! I cannot work on Quake and answer all these questions
all day long. I know you guys want them answered so
here is what I am going to do... I will stop taking
new questions right now and finish answering the 160
peices of mail I still have not gotten to. Once that
is done I am going to have to call this off. Don't be
mad... be happy. This means I can get back to work
on Quake and have it out on time. :)

The reason that Quake will not be released until Spring:
We are making sure that this will be the coolest game
you ever saw. Nothing more than that.

Things that work:
Just about everything.

Things we are working on:
Speed, monsters, actual game play :), more
weapons, figuring out some way to have all
the people who send us mail bugging us about
Quake run over by a truck. Joystick code,
items, environmental hazards, etc...
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Network Play:
We have DeathMatch! (This is really why we are delaying the
release... we have been playing DM too much.)
Right now we can start up a game with n players and
run around killing each other all day long. You
can leave the game, and then jump back in whenever
you like (as long as the server is still running.)
DeathMatch right now is great, and it is going to
get even better. We have found the replacement for
DOOM DeathMatch... finally :)

Engine:
All VESA resolutions are now in. Video hardware support
is in and working for some cards now. This means that
you can run 640x480 at high frame rates. I mean *high*
too. The engine is just about done. There is not much
missing from it now. Textures and modeling are rock solid.
At this point we are working on the game itself and the
engine details... minor but important stuff.

Map Editor:
Carmack just rewrote the editor to allow us more
flexibility while designing levels. This took some
time, but it was worth it. We are now able to
do things that were once impossible with the old
editor.

Done picking on Munchkin.

Please stop sending Quake questions.
I cannot keep answering them... it is taking
way too much time. I know I said I would do
this until Friday... but there is no way I can
keep this up. Please accept my apologies.

Read alt.games.quake for occasional new info.

********
THERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*!
THERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST EITHER.
WE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.

Status of DOOM---Updated: Fri, Jul 28th 3:22pm

We have mastered The Ultimate DOOM! *This is out in stores now*.
There is a patch for registered DOOM owners that will turn your
DOOM into Ultimate DOOM for free. You can find it on ftp.idsoftware.com.

DOOM/DOOM II:
GET VERSION 1.9 FROM ftp.idsoftware.com

The latest patch for Registered/Shareware DOOM is: 1.7 to 1.9
The latest version of Registered DOOM is: 1.9
The latest version of Shareware/Beta DOOM is: 1.9

The latest patch for DOOM II is: 1.7a to 1.9

1.9 is it. There will be NO MORE.

If you have a version of DOOM II dated 8-25 it is pirated.
Do NOT write us asking how to patch it.

Status of games using the DOOM engine---Updated: Wed, Sep 13th, 2:27pm

HEXEN: Beyond Heretic -- This game is out. This game ROCKS!
We will not have 8 player network support in this game
when it comes out. It *will* be added in soon after it
has been released though. (I just verified this for those
of you who thought you heard differently. It is true.)

Strife:  An action / R.P.G. where medieval and high technologies
meld to form a world where warfare and oppression are a way of life.
An underground rebellion, the Movement, is this world's slim hope
for change.  Your wish is to join them and bring the tyranny to
an end. This is where you begin your journey through Strife.
This is being worked on by a company named Rouge. They should
be finished with it before Christmas.

Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Mon, Sep 4th, 12:00pm

Sony Playstation DOOM: Done. Most awesome console version
of DOOM yet. Go get this!

MAC:  MacDOOM II is out in stores now.  The shareware version of DOOM I
is available now.  You can find it on any InfoMac mirror site (there's
over 30 of them).  Here are some you can try:

ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/_Game/_Arcade/doom-i-101.hqx
ftp://ftp.delphi.com/pub/mirrors/info-mac/_Game/_Arcade/doom-i-101.hqx

http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/mac/info-mac/_Game/_Arcade/doom-i-101.hqx

WIN95: This is either finished or almost finished.  We saw an almost-final
version of Win95-DOOM a couple months ago, so it should be done by now.

WINDOWS: There will be NO Windows 3.1 version of DOOM.

Old news
------------------------------------------------------------------
SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag. Do not send
us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

Sun Solaris 2.4: ftp.idsoftware.com:/new/sundoom.tar.gz.  Same as
SGI but uses direct frame buffer access for faster blitting.  Do
not send us mail about this port. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

LINUX: the linux version is at:
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/linuxsdoom.tar.gz  (full-screen)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/linuxxdoom.tar.gz  (X windows)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/sndserver.gz       (bug fixed)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/doom1v18.wad.gz
and may be moved to whatever appropriate directory later. Do not
send us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

QNX: DOOM for the QNX OS is anonymously ftp'able from quics.qnx.com.
It's compiled with Pentium optimizations and supports sound, music,
the VGA console and X Windows with pixel doubling and tripling.
We don't support this version, QNX Software Systems did the port.
This version will run the shareware, registered, or doom2 wadfile.
The files to ftp are:

  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.pax.gz - Console and X versions of QNX DOOM
  /usr/free/doom/doom1.wad.gz   - DOOM v1.666 wad file
  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.faq    - Installation instructions and other
  details

NEXTSTEP: URL for the info page at Omni's WWW site:
  http://www.omnigroup.com/Software/Doom/
There is a DOOM and a DOOM II beta version.
If you have any other questions about Doom (under NEXTSTEP),
contact doom@omnigroup.com .

OS/2: Still waiting. There is no new info. I wish there was. Do not
send us mail about this.

JAG: It's out now. Go buy it. Everyone likes it.

Sega 32X: Released. Buy it.

Ultra 64: We have licensed Williams Entertainment to develop a
unique version of DOOM for Nintendo's U-64.  It is to be available
for the consumer release of the platform.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.
