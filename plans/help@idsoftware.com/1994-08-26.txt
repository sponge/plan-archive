Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Fri, Aug 26th 2:25pm

OS/2: Still working, no dates yet. IBM guys are handling this.
This is how this will work: You will be able to download the
OS/2 version from most BBSs and ftp sites. It will work with
your registered wad or the shareware one. NO CHANGE.

SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag.

LINUX: Same as Irix version. Not finished yet. Out later, though.
This will also be available from most ftp sites.

JAG: Running very fast. We are doing this port in-house. Maps are
being worked on now. They will be the same maps (minus some of the
ones we did not like... plus a few new ones).

MAC: We have found a team to do this. There is no release date. No
development has begun. We just got some Power PCs to test the beta
version on. It should be here soon. Please do NOT ask to test
this. There is no more info on this at this time. NO CHANGE.

WINDOWS: We just got a beta of this. Looks AWESOME. Still no
release date. The MICROSOFT guys are working on this.

NEXTSTEP: There is a version 1.2 available from cs.orst.edu. There will
be a ver 1.6 available there as soon as we release the patch for
the DOS version. This will be out next in-house port. Dave will be
doing this and it will have sound when it's done, just like the SGI version.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one. Please do not send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.

Status of QUAKE---Updated: Tue, Aug 9th 11:38am

This will not be out until sometime next summer.
John now has a simple (slow) engine running. It uses converted
DOOM maps and runs them with flats for textures. It looks REALLY
cool.
Multi-player should go something like this:
Someone owns a fast server somewhere. You dial in and join the
game in progress. Ten or more people at a time can be in the world.
You will not NEED a Pentium to play QUAKE. Everyone knows you don't
need one for DOOM either... but it doesn't hurt anything.
