Status of DOOM---Updated: Mon, July 25th 6:09pm

The latest patch for Registered/Shareware DOOM is: 1.1 to 1.2
The latest version of Registered DOOM is: 1.2
The latest version of Shareware/Beta DOOM is: 1.5
The next patch for Registered/Shareware DOOM will be: 1.5

There is NO version 1.3.
There is a 1.4 beta and a 1.5 beta.
Version 1.4 is available from ftp.uwp.edu and infant2.sphs.indiana.edu.
It is a beta shareware version. There is NO PATCH to 1.4.

We are still waiting on the sound code. There are a few little bugs in
it still that HAVE to be fixed before we release the patch. We know
(I know really well) how impatient some of you are getting. There is
still no firm date on a release. As soon as our sound code guy is
finished the patch will be sent out. There will probably be a 1.6 BETA
version, and then a few days after that we will release the 1.7 patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of DOOM ][---Updated: Fri, July 15th 11:45am

There are now about 32 levels finished.

The new monsters are great. The Archvile (the guy who BFGs you and
walks around waking up the dead) is working great. When he walks
over someone he makes this wonderful backwards gibs sound and they
leap up from the ground. Another new monster, The Undead, shoots
homing rockets out at you. These move a little slower than normal
rockets, and have no blast radius. If there are two of these guys
after you, you don't have much of a chance of living.

DOOM ][ will be available from a store near you in October.
You do not receive a discount for being a registered user.

Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Fri, July 29th 7:22pm

OS/2: Still working, no dates yet. IBM guys are handling this. NO CHANGE.

SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.5ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.

LINUX: Same as Irix version.  Out later, though. This will also be
available from most ftp sites.

JAG: Running very fast. Lighting is working now. This will be out
later this summer probably September. We are doing this. There
will be two new levels in the Jag version. The graphics are
getting faster every day.

MAC: We have found a team to do this. There is no release date. No
development has begun. NO CHANGE.

WINDOWS: Still working, no dates yet. Microsoft guys are handling
this. NO CHANGE.

NeXT: There is a version 1.2 available from cs.orst.edu. There will
be a ver 1.6 available there as soon as we release the patch for
the DOS version. NO CHANGE.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of QUAKE---Updated: Mon, July 25th 6:14pm

This will not be out until sometime next summer.
John Carmack is currently designing the engine.
Multi-player should go something like this:
Someone owns a fast server somewhere. You dial in and join the
game in progress. Ten or more people at a time can be in the world.
You will not NEED a Pentium to play QUAKE. Everyone knows you don't
need one for DOOM either... but it doesn't hurt anything.

DOOM SAYS INSUFFICIENT DPMI MEMORY! WHAT DO I DO??

If you have DOS ver 6.x do this--

Restart the computer
When you see the STARTING MS-DOS message hold down a SHIFT key
Wait until a C: prompt appears
Let go of the SHIFT key
Run the game.

If you have DOS 5.x or earlier(wretch)--

Put a BLANK disk in the A: drive.
At the C: prompt type FORMAT A:/S and hit ENTER
When the disk is finished being formatted restart the computer.
Run the game.

If this does not work you may not have enough memory.
Run MEM and see what it reports. You need at least 3.3 MB TOTAL MEMORY
FREE.

WHEN TRYING TO RUN A MODEM GAME THE MODEM JUST SITS THERE.
IT NEVER EVEN DIALS OUT. NOW WHAT??

The SerSetup program initializes the modem too quickly. You will
need to initialize the modem from the DOS prompt like this:

ECHO AT Z M1 blah blah > COMx

This will initialize the modem... you may get an error and an
'ABORT, RETRY, FAIL' message... just keep RETRYing until it takes
it. (If your friend has this problem he/she needs to do the same)
Then do this:

ECHO ATDT 555-2222 > COMx

This will dial out to your friend. At your friends house he/she
needs to do this:

ECHO ATS0=1

This will set him/her up for an auto-answer. When the phone rings
and the modems connect, you both need to go into SETUP and select
ALREADY CONNECTED. That's all there is to it.

I RUN THE GAME AND AFTER A WHILE MY GUY GOES NUTS. HE SPINS AROUND
AND SHOOTS LIKE HE'S ON ACID OR SOMETHING. WHAT GIVES?? HAS HE GONE
BLIND?!

This is a bug in the software. There will be a patch out soon. This
problem arises using a PS/2 style mouse and some keyboards. You
can use the keyboard only or use a serial mouse until the patch is
out. The patch will be sent to all registered users. You will also
be able to D/L the patch from most ftp sites and BBS's.
