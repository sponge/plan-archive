Status of DOOM---Updated: Wed, Jun 28th 11:55am

We have mastered The Ultimate DOOM!  This is a special release of
the original DOOM for retail with an ADDITIONAL FOURTH EPISODE
titled "Thy Flesh Consumed".  The box also contains a validation
for 5 free hours of DWANGO time (DOOM modem network play).  The DOOM
box has been redesigned as to look unique in the stores next to all
the original DOOM shareware boxes.

We are planning an upgrade policy for registered DOOM owners to
move up to The Ultimate DOOM. Please do NOT hassle us about how it
will work!  We will tell you when we know.

**The plan right now is that we are going to release a patch so
**that if you own registered DOOM already you can upgrade to Thy
**Flesh Consumed for free. This could change... but it probably won't.

Status of Shareware DOOM:

GET VERSION 1.9 FROM ftp.idsoftware.com

The latest patch for Registered/Shareware DOOM is: 1.7 to 1.9
The latest version of Registered DOOM is: 1.9
The latest version of Shareware/Beta DOOM is: 1.9

The latest patch for DOOM II is: 1.7a to 1.9

1.9 is it. There will be NO MORE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Status of DOOM II---Updated: Fri, Jan 27th 4:05pm

If you have a version dated 8-25 it is pirate. Do NOT write
us asking how to patch it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Status of games using the DOOM engine---Updated: Mon, Jul 1st 4:39pm

Heretic: Done with the patch. No thanks to Chris and Max bugging us.
Download it now and be happy.

Strife: Still working. No updates. I will try to put something in here
soon about Strife.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Status of DOOM The Movie---Updated Thu, Nov 3rd 1:35pm

Still in the birth process. Many very cool people have shown
interest in the project. There is no release date for the movie.
Nothing new.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Thu, Jun 1 1995 4:04pm

OS/2: Still waiting. There is no new info. I wish there was. Do not
send us mail about this.

MAC: Lion Software is working on this right now. They are VERY close
to having it finished. At the moment they are trying to get the DOS/
MAC network code working. They are also working on optimizing the
code to make it run faster. They should have everything ready to go
in two weeks. DO NOT SEND ME MAIL ABOUT THIS. I *WILL* DELETE IT!

WINDOWS: We just got a beta of this. Looks AWESOME. Still no
release date. The Microsoft guys are working on this. NO CHANGE.
THERE IS NO NEW INFO ABOUT THIS...

SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag. Do not send
us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

Sun Solaris 2.4: ftp.idsoftware.com:/new/sundoom.tar.gz.  Same as
SGI but uses direct frame buffer access for faster blitting.  Do
not send us mail about this port. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

LINUX: the linux version is at:
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/linuxsdoom.tar.gz  (full-screen)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/linuxxdoom.tar.gz  (X windows)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/sndserver.gz       (bug fixed)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/doom1v18.wad.gz
and may be moved to whatever appropriate directory later. Do not
send us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

QNX: DOOM for the QNX OS is anonymously ftp'able from quics.qnx.com.
It's compiled with Pentium optimizations and supports sound, music,
the VGA console and X Windows with pixel doubling and tripling.
We don't support this version, QNX Software Systems did the port.
This version will run the shareware, registered, or doom2 wadfile.
The files to ftp are:

  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.pax.gz - Console and X versions of QNX DOOM
  /usr/free/doom/doom1.wad.gz   - DOOM v1.666 wad file
  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.faq    - Installation instructions and other
  details

NEXTSTEP: URL for the info page at Omni's WWW site:
  http://www.omnigroup.com/Software/Doom/
There is a DOOM and a DOOM II beta version.
If you have any other questions about Doom (under NEXTSTEP),
contact doom@omnigroup.com .

JAG: It's out now. Go buy it. Everyone likes it.
Sega 32X: Released. Buy it.

Ultra 64: We have licensed Williams Entertainment to develop a
unique version of DOOM for Nintendo's U-64.  It is to be available
for the consumer release of the platform.

There will never be a port to these machines:
Amiga, Sinclair 2000, Apple //gs, TRS-80.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.
*NOTE: Some of you are morons. When I ask you NOT to send me mail about
*this stuff, I mean it. We get enough mail as it is... when you send
*us mail about this it just slows us down. Don't be a moron.

Status of QUAKE---Updated: Mon, Jun 26th 1:24pm

********
THERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*!
THERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST RIGHT NOW EITHER.
WE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.
********

This will not be out until sometime in the Winter of '95.
**That's THIS COMING CHRISTMAS for those of you who don't
**understand what I mean. Like that Chris guy. Man, what a 'tard.
Ok, ok... you guys wanted more.
As of today the following things are working/semi-working:
Network play
Basic Engine
Object Modeling
Map Editor
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Network Play:
Server/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on
a DOS, NeXT, Linux, or SGI etc... box. Once the server is running you
get on another machine (DOS, NeXT, Linux, SGI, etc) and log into the
server. A play window opens and you can see the other players, move
around, quit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but
this will be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc,
will be added in later.
This is still the same. There have been no changes.

Basic Engine:
This is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,
but this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single
player.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the
engine.
This is running faster everyday. We are using other maps to test on
now and things are looking very awesome.

Object Modeling:
Kevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200
polygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we
would need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail
we want. So far this is the only "thing" in the game. He does not
animate, but it is still cool to watch him be "born". At the moment
he is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.
We have a couple of different monster and person models now.
The all look very good.

Map Editor:
The map editor is completely finished. We have been working with
it for a while now, creating new levels.

**We will not be adding anything new to this for a while.
There are MANY cool new things going into the game right now, but
we do not want to give it all away just yet. We have been creating
small test levels for the past few weeks, and these are looking
awesome. The general game idea has started to solidify, but please
do not write asking what it is.
I will add some new stuff here when there is *a lot* more to add.

Read alt.games.quake for occasional new info.
