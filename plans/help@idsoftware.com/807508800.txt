Status of QUAKE---Updated: Fri, Aug 4 at 5:35pm

****
You can find screenshots of some of our Quake stuff
on ftp.idsoftware.com in /idstuff/quake. The file is quakepix.zip.
By the way, Quake is an action game, not an RPG.
****

********
THERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*!
THERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST EITHER.
WE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.
********

This will not be out until sometime around this Christmas.

Things that work:
network play, mouse control
sprite engine, sound, entity programming
polygon engine, map editor

Things we are working on:
speed, speed, monsters, speed, maps
sound effects w/help from Trent:)
and a lot more.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Network Play:
Server/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on
a DOS, NeXT, Linux, or SGI etc... box. Once the server is running you
get on another machine (DOS, NeXT, Linux, SGI, etc) and log into the
server. A play window opens and you can see the other players, move
around, quit out, get back in, etc... Deathmatch is working a little
now and we can run around and shoot each other with fireballs.

Engine:
This is running very fast. We have completed some really great
looking levels that we are running around in. The lighting is
too good to believe. There are doors/plats/switches/etc... in
the game now.

Object Modeling:
Kevin is working on creating the monsters/players and Michael
is making the draw really fast. These are looking great. Sprites
suck compared to proper models.

Map Editor:
The map editor is completely finished. We have been working with
it for a while now, creating new levels.

Please do not send us mail about Quake. It just slows us down.
Thanks.

Read alt.games.quake for occasional new info.

*There is not really anything new that I can add here.
*I wish that there were. Everything is still pretty much
*the same.

OS/2: Still waiting. There is no new info. I wish there was. Do not
send us mail about this.

MAC: Lion Software is working on this right now. They are VERY close
to having it finished. At the moment they are trying to get the DOS/
MAC network code working. They are also working on optimizing the
code to make it run faster. They should have everything ready to go
in two weeks. DO NOT SEND ME MAIL ABOUT THIS. I *WILL* DELETE IT!

WINDOWS: We just got a beta of this. Looks AWESOME. Still no
release date. The Microsoft guys are working on this. NO CHANGE.
THERE IS NO NEW INFO ABOUT THIS...

SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag. Do not send
us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

Sun Solaris 2.4: ftp.idsoftware.com:/new/sundoom.tar.gz.  Same as
SGI but uses direct frame buffer access for faster blitting.  Do
not send us mail about this port. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

LINUX: the linux version is at:
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/linuxsdoom.tar.gz  (full-screen)

and may be moved to whatever appropriate directory later. Do not
send us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

QNX: DOOM for the QNX OS is anonymously ftp'able from quics.qnx.com.
It's compiled with Pentium optimizations and supports sound, music,
the VGA console and X Windows with pixel doubling and tripling.
We don't support this version, QNX Software Systems did the port.
This version will run the shareware, registered, or doom2 wadfile.
The files to ftp are:

  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.pax.gz - Console and X versions of QNX DOOM
  /usr/free/doom/doom1.wad.gz   - DOOM v1.666 wad file
  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.faq    - Installation instructions and other
  details

There is a DOOM and a DOOM II beta version.
If you have any other questions about Doom (under NEXTSTEP),
contact doom@omnigroup.com .

JAG: It's out now. Go buy it. Everyone likes it.

Sega 32X: Released. Buy it.

Ultra 64: We have licensed Williams Entertainment to develop a
unique version of DOOM for Nintendo's U-64.  It is to be available
for the consumer release of the platform.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.
