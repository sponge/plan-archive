Status of QUAKE---Updated: Mon, Feb 26th, 1996

The engine compatibility test was released Feb 24th. Current solutions
to common problems:

Sound Not Working: your BLASTER variable is probably set with lowercase
characters. Update your AUTOEXEC.BAT and change the characters to uppercase.

Underwater Wave Effect: it does NOT work at screen resolutions above
320x200.

Status of DOOM---Updated: Fri, Jul 28th 3:22pm

We have mastered The Ultimate DOOM! *This is out in stores now*.
There is a patch for registered DOOM owners that will turn your
DOOM into Ultimate DOOM for free. You can find it on ftp.idsoftware.com.

DOOM/DOOM II:
GET VERSION 1.9 FROM ftp.idsoftware.com

The latest patch for Registered/Shareware DOOM is: 1.7 to 1.9
The latest version of Registered DOOM is: 1.9
The latest version of Shareware/Beta DOOM is: 1.9

The latest patch for DOOM II is: 1.7a to 1.9

1.9 is it. There will be NO MORE.

If you have a version of DOOM II dated 8-25 it is pirated.
Do NOT write us asking how to patch it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Status of games using the DOOM engine---Updated: Wed, Sep 13th, 2:27pm

HEXEN: Beyond Heretic -- This game is out. This game ROCKS!
We will not have 8 player network support in this game
when it comes out. It *will* be added in soon after it
has been released though. (I just verified this for those
of you who thought you heard differently. It is true.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Status of DOOM ports---Updated: Mon, Sep 4th, 12:00pm

Sony Playstation DOOM: Done. Most awesome console version
of DOOM yet. Go get this!

MAC:  MacDOOM II is out in stores now.  The shareware version of DOOM I
is available now.  You can find it on any InfoMac mirror site (there's
over 30 of them).  Here are some you can try:

ftp://mirrors.aol.com/pub/info-mac/_Game/_Arcade/doom-i-101.hqx
ftp://ftp.delphi.com/pub/mirrors/info-mac/_Game/_Arcade/doom-i-101.hqx
http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Archive/game/arc/doom-i-101.hqx
http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/mac/info-mac/_Game/_Arcade/doom-i-101.hqx

WIN95: This is either finished or almost finished.  We saw an almost-final
version of Win95-DOOM a couple months ago, so it should be done by now.

WINDOWS: There will be NO Windows 3.1 version of DOOM.

Old news
------------------------------------------------------------------
SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag. Do not send
us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

Sun Solaris 2.4: ftp.idsoftware.com:/new/sundoom.tar.gz.  Same as
SGI but uses direct frame buffer access for faster blitting.  Do
not send us mail about this port. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

LINUX: the linux version is at:
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/linuxsdoom.tar.gz  (full-screen)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/linuxxdoom.tar.gz  (X windows)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/sndserver.gz       (bug fixed)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/doom1v18.wad.gz
and may be moved to whatever appropriate directory later. Do not
send us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

QNX: DOOM for the QNX OS is anonymously ftp'able from quics.qnx.com.
It's compiled with Pentium optimizations and supports sound, music,
the VGA console and X Windows with pixel doubling and tripling.
We don't support this version, QNX Software Systems did the port.
This version will run the shareware, registered, or doom2 wadfile.
The files to ftp are:

  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.pax.gz - Console and X versions of QNX DOOM
  /usr/free/doom/doom1.wad.gz   - DOOM v1.666 wad file
  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.faq    - Installation instructions and other
  details

NEXTSTEP: URL for the info page at Omni's WWW site:
  http://www.omnigroup.com/Software/Doom/
There is a DOOM and a DOOM II beta version.
If you have any other questions about Doom (under NEXTSTEP),
contact doom@omnigroup.com .

OS/2: Still waiting. There is no new info. I wish there was. Do not
send us mail about this.

JAG: It's out now. Go buy it. Everyone likes it.

Sega 32X: Released. Buy it.

Ultra 64: We have licensed Williams Entertainment to develop a
unique version of DOOM for Nintendo's U-64.  It is to be available
for the consumer release of the platform.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.
