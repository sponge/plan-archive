Old news
------------------------------------------------------------------
SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag. Do not send
us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

Sun Solaris 2.4: ftp.idsoftware.com:/new/sundoom.tar.gz.  Same as
SGI but uses direct frame buffer access for faster blitting.  Do
not send us mail about this port. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

LINUX: the linux version is at:
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/linuxsdoom.tar.gz  (full-screen)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/linuxxdoom.tar.gz  (X windows)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/sndserver.gz       (bug fixed)
ftp.cc.gatech.edu:/pub/Linux/games/doom/doom1v18.wad.gz
and may be moved to whatever appropriate directory later. Do not
send us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.

QNX: DOOM for the QNX OS is anonymously ftp'able from quics.qnx.com.
It's compiled with Pentium optimizations and supports sound, music,
the VGA console and X Windows with pixel doubling and tripling.
We don't support this version, QNX Software Systems did the port.
This version will run the shareware, registered, or doom2 wadfile.
The files to ftp are:

  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.pax.gz - Console and X versions of QNX DOOM
  /usr/free/doom/doom1.wad.gz   - DOOM v1.666 wad file
  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.faq    - Installation instructions and other
  details

NEXTSTEP: URL for the info page at Omni's WWW site:
  http://www.omnigroup.com/Software/Doom/
There is a DOOM and a DOOM II beta version.
If you have any other questions about Doom (under NEXTSTEP),
contact doom@omnigroup.com .

OS/2: Still waiting. There is no new info. I wish there was. Do not
send us mail about this.

JAG: It's out now. Go buy it. Everyone likes it.

Sega 32X: Released. Buy it.

Ultra 64: We have licensed Williams Entertainment to develop a
unique version of DOOM for Nintendo's U-64.  It is to be available
for the consumer release of the platform.

If there is not a release date on one of the above that means it
doesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.
If I had more I would put it here.
