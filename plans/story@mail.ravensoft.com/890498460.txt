Fade Away: A Serial Story
**************************

CHAPTER ONE: ECHOES OF THE MIND (By Eric Biessman, Designer)

As the cold rays of the morning sun broke through my drawn window 
shades, I stirred uncomfortably in my sitting position.  Muscles 
that I didn't even know existed screamed with the use, angry with 
me for their continued idleness.  Even still, I sat there as I had 
sat for the last three days, quietly gripping the cold black metal 
of a loaded .44 Automag.  You see, it wasn't a question of were 
they going to be coming for me, it was when would they be coming 
for me.

The steady drip of the faucet and the stiffness of my body were 
enough to assure me that I was at least still alive.  During the 
early hours of the past morning, a terrible smell had started 
creeping from the kitchen, but I couldn't bring myself to go back 
into that room.  Now, as the sun began to warm the apartment around 
me, the smell began to grow.  It didn't matter though, they should 
be here before too long.

As had happened so many times during the last couple of days, my 
mind wandered back to where this had all started.  Closing my eyes, 
I pressed the back of my head against the rough plaster walls, 
uttering a quiet groan from the pain and stiffness that was 
wracking my body. 

It is nearly laughable that my life was ruined because of a car.  It 
was a 1965 cherry red 'stang.  It was the kind of car that screamed 	
for your attention, convertible, and in total mint condition.  It 
was definitely the car that caught my eye, but it was the woman who 	
made me stop.   I always was a sucker for a damsel in distress.  

I guess that my fate was sealed the moment she...

*********************************************************************
FADE AWAY: A SERIAL STORY PART II (By Kenn Hoekstra, Designer)
 
I guess that my fate was sealed the moment she... cried out for 
help.  I dashed over to the alley where that beautiful Mustang was 
parked and searched around frantically.  There she was, backing 
away from three thugs who were quickly closing the distance between 
them.  "Once you're in, you're in," the first thug sneered.  
"There's no going back now."  The second man rapped a lead pipe 
against the palm of his hand and just glared at the cowering 
woman.  God, she was beautiful.  Flowing, white summer dress, 
beautiful green eyes and long brown hair.  I was wondering if 
I really believed in love at first sight or if I should walk by again.

I tore myself from the power of her charms and lowered my shoulder, 
barreling into the first man.  He cried out in pain as he crashed to 
the damp alley pavement.  A spinning kick sent the second man 
sprawling and into a drove of garbage cans. The pipe he was fondling 
clattered to the ground. My fist connected squarely with the third 
man's jaw and sent him quickly to the land of dreams.  I grabbed 
the beautiful angel by the wrist and pulled her along to the main 
street.  She pulled away and climbed into the Mustang, reaching 
over to unlock the passenger door. "Get in," she said.  "Hurry!"  
What could I do?  I had no choice at this point, did I? And so I 
climbed aboard and sealed my fate.

She slammed on the gas and screeched the tires as we pulled away 
from the scene.  Houses were racing by as she continued to stare 
intently at the road ahead, her hand running through her wind blown 
hair.  "Are you okay?" I asked.  "I'm fine," she said. "But you're 
not."  I glanced over at her with a confused look. "You have no 
idea what you've gotten yourself into..."

*********************************************************************
FADE AWAY: PART III (By Chris Foster, Designer)

She drove around for the better part of an hour, saying nothing.  
I assumed she'd talk more when she was ready, so I sat back and just 
watched her out	of the corner of my eye.

My mother always warned me about life in the city, but like all 
young men looking for a way out of their dull lives - I left home 
at the first opportunity.  My first job was washing cars, the kind of 
work that leaves your mind free to think and wander.  I had a lot of 
dreams back then.  A lot of nonsense thought up by a gullible mind.
Dreams are for poets and politicians.  I know that now for a 
certainty.  I've known it since the day I met Destiny face to face 
in a red mustang.

We reached an empty parking lot on the corner of Third and Chandler.
Not a good neighborhood.  The streets in that part of town wind around
the buildings like those ribbons on balloons and upscale christmas 
presents.  Going nowhere you'd like to end up and somewhere you're 
better off not being.
 
After she killed the engine, she reached for the glove compartment 
and began searching. Failing there, and ignoring my curious glance, 
she continued her search in the back.

"Oh no", she said, "I must've dropped my purse in that alleyway..."

She then looked at me.
The way a lost child looks at the clerk in a store.
The way a puppy looks at you when its been bad.
The way a woman looks at a man when she's about to take control of 
his life...
 
*********************************************************************
FADE AWAY:  PART IV (by Pat Lipo, Programmer)

   ...I met that look and gazed deep into those deep green pools, 
and swallowed back my gut reaction, even though it kicked and screamed
and demanded to be heard.  I've lived every day of my life getting 
into scrapes, spots and jams, all because I'm a sucker for a woman 
in need.  Well, screw that.  My instinct knew who always got the
shit end of the toilet brush...

   As I searched my mind for some snappy macho retort, I saw the big
glistening droplets well up in her eyes.  Damn.  Why do they always
have to do that?

   "But the men... they were coming... and I had to put it... my
purse...  They can't get it... the key... What if my brother...?"  
She started her sob routine, wasn't making any sense.  That stupid,
sappy part of me kicked itself free and set up shop.  Granted, she
was a babe to end all babes, but in the back of my head I had the
feeling that I was being played like Zamfir's pan flute.

   "All right, lady, I helped you once, I guess I'm stuck with you
for now."  I hopped out of the car and slid over the hood to the
driver's side.  "I'll drive.  This may get rough."  Truth is, she
handled the ragtop like a pro.  I just wanted to get behind the 
Mustang's wheel and cut loose.  I whipped into a bootlegger and 
pushed 70 heading back to the alley, her purse and those thugs.  

   "We may have to do a quick dash-and-grab if they're still in the
area.  Hope you're up for it.  What do they call you?"

   She started to form a word but held it for a split second.  
"Julie.  Julie Hanson," she lied.  She wasn't very good at it.

   "All right, Julie."  I screeched around a corner, fishtailing 
wildly and just missing the lamppost on the other side.  I made a 
mental note to kick my own ass if I scratched the ride.  Man, it was 
like driving a dream!  I punched it up to 80 as we catapulted towards
the street where I had found her.  "So what's the big deal with your 
purse?  I assume you're not just worried about cancelling your 
checks."

   She tossed her hair back and gave me a bit of a smile.  "I left
something in it, something I've got to get back.  If they get..."

*********************************************************************
Fade Away - Part V (by John Scott, Programmer)

....that key, we are all doomed. Oh great, I thought, just to top it 
all off she is a paranoid too. But let`s face it, it was either this 
or another night in front of the box, yielding to mind numbing 
gameshows interspersed with diabolical attempts to get you to spend 
your money. 

	I was dying to ask, I just had to. Nothing on this earth 
could stop me.  "So, Julie, what exactly is the key for ?". I tried 
to add an element of apathy to my words, but failed miserably. "You 
don`t want to know", she replied firmly, "You really don`t want to 
know". I kept my eyes on the road, my sixth sense telling me I 
probably didn`t. We drove in silence for a while.

This let me do some thinking, quite often a bad move in situations 
like this. I was trying to clandestinely retrieve an object in a 
public place in a bright red mustang convertable accompanied by a 
drop dead gorgeous young lady. Sounds like the kind of stupid move 
you would read in a 50 cents novel. Ok...taxi..to the bar just down 
the street...take off my coat....and Julie picks me up three blocks 
south...sounds like a plan. Any sign of the thugs and I walk calmly 
past. What could go wrong ? 

	As she drops me off at the taxi pickup point, she gives me a 
peck on the cheek and wishes me good luck. She certainly knows how to 
get a man to do what she wants. I find it somewhat disconcerting that 
she doesn`t look back as she speeds away........

	After 20 minutes of waiting on the corner carrying a womans 
purse, looking like some sort of rent boy touting for business, I 
realise she isn`t coming back. My mind races with possibilities. What 
could have happened ?

	With the first light of dawn, I realise I`ve been up all night 
on this wild escapade. The need for a hot drink overcomes me as I see 
a coffee shop open just down the road. I`ll think better after one of 
those, I tell myself, in the vain hope that I could make some sense 
out of this mess....and I still have her purse....

*********************************************************************
fade Away - Part VI (by Kevin Long, Artist Spectacular!)

	I push open the weathered door to the coffee shop, a 
tinkling bell above the door announcing my entrance. The 
painted name, peeling and faded, on the door's unwashed glass 
proclaims that this is Joe's Coffee Emporium. Some emporium. Upon 
the walls, once painted white but now yellowed with nicotine, are 
cheaply framed prints of faraway places faded by the years in 
direct sunlight. The floor's badly in need of a good mopping. The 
scuffed checker-board linoleum looks to have accumulated fifty 
years worth of disgusting crud and dried urine. In fact, my shoes 
make a sickening sucking-squishing sound with every step I 
take towards the counter. If I didn't need a cup of joe so badly 
I'd high-tail it outta here.

	I gingerly take a seat at the counter upon a rickety stool 
upholstered in red vinyl. Two seats down from me is a ratty-looking 
bum passed out with his head lying in a plate of half-eaten eggs 
and hash browns. He obivously hasn't bathed in weeks since I can 
smell his pugnent aroma from here. To bring the point home, a roach 
scurries out of his sleeve takes a look around, forms an opinion of 
the dingy shop, and returns to the darkness of its host's sleeve. The 
bum is the only other patron besides me.

	I call out for some service and an elderly woman shuffles from 
the kitchen area asking, "What's yer pleasure, mister?" Like the bum 
two seats down, she, too, looks like she could use a good scrubbing 
and hosin' down. Her nametag says her name is Trixie.

	"Cup of black coffee for me. Get my pal there whatever he 
wants, too", I say jutting a thumb in the direction of the comatose 
bum.

	Drawing my coffee she remarks, "Think he's already got himself 
want he wants most... an egg and hashbrown pillow", and cackles a 
high-pitched gale of laughter that turns into a phlegm-spewing coughing 
jag. When her coughing finally subsides, she noisily clears the back 
of her throat and spits a big honker onto the floor behind the counter.
"That'll be two-bits", the old hag demands as she sets my coffee 
before me. I rummage through my pants pocket and throw a quarter and 
a dime onto the counter. "Keep the change, sweetheart". She scoops up 
the coins, rings it up on an ancient cash register, dumps the change 
into the drawer and slams it shut with a reverberating thud. Trixie 
then proceeds to wipe down the counter with a rag that's even dirtier 
than the floor. 

	 While I'm sipping my coffee, which is surprisingly good, 
I decide to rummage through the good-looker's purse. Perhaps I 
can get her address from her license and return her belongings. 
To be frank, my motives for doing so are not purely of the 
good-samaritain variety. I find her wallet, open it, and pull out 
her license from a little pocket with a clear plastic window. 
God...this woman's so drop dead gorgeous even her license photo looks 
like a Playboy gatefold. Like most people, mine resembles an unshaven 
troglodyte thats been beaten by a bevy of ugly sticks. Her address is 
on 43rd. Not far from here. I return her license back into its clear 
plastic pocket and open the sleeve where her paper money should 
be. Jesus....there must be over twenty G's here! All in thousand 
dollar bills! Wow...beautiful and rich. I just struck oil, ladies 
and gentlemen.

	I close up her wallet and slip it into my coat pocket. I'm 
not stealin' it, mind you, just making sure that much money and her 
address stays close to me. I resume my invasion of her privacy and 
come across an old wooden box about the size of my hand at the 
bottom of her purse. The top of the box is intricately craved with 
little skeletons intertwined in an orgy of death. Interesting. I 
pull at the top to open it and the lid comes free with a hiss of 
escaping air. What the hell! Inside the box, resting on red velvet, is 
a mummified hand holding an ornate key carved from bone. Gold in 
elaborate designs is inlaid throughout the length of the key. When 
I try to remove the key from the grisly hand it doesn't budge. Behind 
me, the bell above the door announces another patron to Joe's fine 
establishment.

	While I'm intently studying the key someone sits between 
me and the bum. God...this guy smells even worse than the bum. I 
look at my new neighbor and I'm mildly surprised to see that every 
inch of him is completely covered with dirty black cloth, even his hands 
and face. The only openings in his shroud are two eye slits. If he 
had a sickle I'd swear he was the grim reaper.

	I'm about to move down a couple of seats to escape the stench 
when the "Reaper" croaks in a voice from beyond the grave, "The key. 
Give it to me", and grabs my wrist holding the box with its treasure. 
I try to snatch my hand back, but his grip is like a steel vice. I 
think I hear a slight cracking noise emitting from my wrist and the 
shooting pain confirms my first impression. Trying to not let on 
that he's starting to hurt me, I boldly state, "Get your own key, 
Elephant Man".

	"It is my key", rasps the "Reaper", and snatches the box out 
of my hand before I can even react. Once he has the box, he's up and 
heading for the door. God, this guy moves like greased lightning! 
Before I'm even off my stool, he's out the door.

	I crash through the coffee shop door and just catch a glimpse 
of a black shroud rounding the corner into the alleyway next to Joe's. 
I sprint around the corner and almost run headlong into the "Reaper". 
He's bent over the box, staring into its interior which is glowing an 
other-worldly green. I try to sieze the box back, but the "Reaper" 
backhands me across the face sending me flying into a pile of trash 
bags. Damn, that hurt! I jump up and leap at big n' ugly. I mean 
to slug the guy in the kisser, but end up missing when he ducks. 
My errant fist catches on some of the fabric of his hood and yanks 
it from his head. The "Reaper" looks up at me with eyes smouldering 
rage. I'm totally stunned and stammer, "You! It can't be you. Not 
you...."

*********************************************************************
Fade Away - Part VII (By Bobby Duncanson, Designer)

	The "Reaper" looks up at me with eyes smouldering 
rage. I'm totally stunned and stammer, "You! It can't be you. Not 
you...."


	It was her! But why I kept asking myself over and over 
again.  Then her eyes turned emerald green. The same as the box.
I tried to get back up onto my feet, but she had me in some kind
of spell...... like I was hypnotized.  I couldn't move anything.
I tried to yell for help, but nothing was coming out. Everything 
seemed to be in sort of a slow-motion.  I couldn't look away. I 
was totally immersed.  I thought to myself.....I knew I should have
ordered decafe.  Then suddenly she looked away.....obviously 
something caught her attention.  I could hear what sounded like 
a car traveling at a high rate of speed down the alleyway. As I 
attempted to stand the car came to a screeching halt.  I couldn't 
believe my eyes. It was the red Mustang with Julie at the helm. 
"That is not possible!" I yelled out. "What's not possible?" she 
replied as she got out the car.  I turned and looked back to where 
she once was and she was gone!  Obviously I thought to myself, 
because she is standing right in front of me.  But how? This doen't 
make any sense.  None at all.  I tried to explain to her what in 
hell just happened to me in the coffee shop just around the corner. 
"Coffee shop?" she says....."that place has been closed for years.  
A lady named Trixie used to own it." "Use to own it?" I asked 
confused as ever.  "Time is running out so we better get the hell 
out of here while we still have time!" she said.  

	Both of us scurried into the Mustang.  She slammed the tranny 
into reverse leaving the alleyway like a backwards calvary.  I prayed 
there would be no crossing traffic as we exited.  She turned the 
wheel right and slammed on the brakes as the front end came swoosing 
out onto the road.  It seemed like we were in a Starsky and Hutch 
movie with a minor switch in characters.  She then straightened
the wheel and floored it. The tires churned out what seemed to 
be a fog of rubber smoke and a smell that only a mechanic could 
love.  Then the tires finally caught the pavement and we were off.
I noticed she was right about the coffee shop.  It was all boarded
up along with every shop on the street.  I also noticed something 
else......her purse was right by my feet.  The exit out of the 
alleyway must have jarred it loose from under the seat.  But 
wait a minute.......I never gave her her purse. I noticed a green 
glow emulating from it.  As I reached down to grab it..........

*********************************************************************
ade Away - Part VIII (By Bob Love,  Programmer)

As I reached down to grab it Julie latched on to my arm with a grip 
of terror. "Don't touch it, please."

"How did it get here?  I left it back in the coffee shop." I 
stopped, confused. "Or at least it used to be a coffee shop. Now 
it's all boarded up and I'm getting confused.  And I don't like 
being confused..."

"Ian," she moaned to no one in particular, "will this never end?"

I grabbed the steering wheel and pulled hard to the side.  Julie 
was forced to slam on the brakes and stop at the road side.

I could feel the anger that had been brewing in me break loose. 
"That does it! I want some answers and I want them now." I turned 
off the car and grabbed the keys. "Now you start talking or I'm 
out of here."

She was startled by my outburst but I had to hand it to her, she 
composed herself very quickly. "Very well, you've got a right to 
know.  The trouble started with my brother, Ian Malcom."

"Never heard of him..."

"He's a mathematician of some fame. Or as Ian liked to say, he was 
a chaostatitian. He worked in an area of mathematics dealing 
with when complex systems break down."

I nodded for her to continue even though I was starting to feel 
like a dog whose owner was trying to explain to it how to set 
the time on a VCR.

"His latest project was dealing with time/space physics and how 
it could be thrown into a state or chaos - warped if you will.  
Warped to produce things not known to this universe."

"So you're saying he was studying magic?" I laughed.

She seemed lost for a moment.  Looking down at the car floor 
she mumbled, "There are more things between heaven and earth..."

Then her head snapped up and those green eyes of hers glowed. 
She held up her right index finger, a small yellow flame dancing 
from the tip. "That's exactly what I'm saying." 

I tried to look unimpressed."Nice trick. I saw David Copperfield 
do the same thing on TV not too long ago." 

She grabbed my hand and placed it over the flame that danced on 
her finger. I felt no heat from it.  That just wasn't possible.

"Okay, so maybe you're telling the truth."

She smiled and continued on as if
