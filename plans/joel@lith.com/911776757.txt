I just have to give a little love to the fine folks on the Shogo team.  I have been playing a spot of Shogo multiplayer on the net and it is definitely all that and a big old bag of Taco Bell flavored Doritos.  Congrats peeps...you own.

Monolith has a wild year ahead of us in terms of supporting our titles from this year (Shogo, Blood 2, Rage of Mages, and Get Medieval) and making sure everyone gets everything they need to keep enjoying these awesome games. Of course we'll also be launching some sweet new titles which have yet to be announced (look for press releases over the next couple of weeks).

As always we want to keep you the gamers happy so keep giving us the great feedback you always do through our forums, our support site at http://support.lith.com, and e-mail (especially when you want to say something nice :-))
