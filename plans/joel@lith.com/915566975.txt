1/5/99

I'm back!  Ok...so you never knew I was gone.  Well, I had a wonderful two week vacation showing off my baby to my family back in good old Massachussetts.  It's a new year so get ready for great things from this wild and wooly game company known as Monolith.

On the work front I'm going to be finalizing all our print ad and online ad campaigns for the spring.  We've got a new production manager named Kris Walker who I know will be improving all of our marketing and packaging pieces...welcome Kris!

On the gaming front I am anxiously awaiting my copy of Baldur's Gate and hitting myself over the head repeatedly for not pre-ordering.

That's all for this weeks .plan.
