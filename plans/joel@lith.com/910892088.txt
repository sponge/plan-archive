Ahh...sometimes its good just to laugh.  Mosey on over to PlanetShogo (after you finish reading my plan file of course) and take a gander at this very funny pic:

Shogo is out.  What more do I need to say. You want this game, you need this game, you are getting very sleepy...

So, what pray tell is going on in ye olde marketing department you ask?  Its contest time!  Just because you are all diligent and die-hard Monolith fans who quickly run to the store to purchase every game we release (you do don't you?), doesn't mean that there aren't plenty of folks out there who are unaware of the incredible gaming experiences they are missing.  To help get the word out we are running, or will be running, quite a few nifty contests and promotions over the next few weeks.  There are some very cool prizes that you will have a stab at winning (can you say Shogo standee boys and girls).

I won't list them all in my plan file (for now head over to contests.ign.com) but I would suggest you sign up for the Monolith Newsletter so you don't miss out.

Other than that its time to gear up for the next round of marketing madness as we gather steam for the 1st and 2nd Quarter of '99.
