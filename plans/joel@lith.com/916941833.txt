Ok.  So I just finished reading through all the responses to the recent PlanetShogo (http:\www.planetshogo.com) query about the lack of multiplayer servers for Shogo.  My first comment is to thank everyone who wrote in for taking the time to make your voice heard on a subject that you obviously care about.  We are paying attention and we do value your input.  

Although I can't respond to every comment and concern in my plan file I can promise that I will be working with others here at Monolith to address these issues in terms of finding solutions were applicable and making every effort to ensure Shogo's continued viability as, IMHO, one of the best multiplayer titles for FPS fans.

One exciting piece of news related to this issue...a new dedicated server was put up last night called "Play against the Monolith Developers!!!" and you should be seeing some of us folks on there as time permits. (Thanks Chris Hewett)

What are you waiting for...go play!
