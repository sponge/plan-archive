3/21:

What I'm reading at the moment:

- Leo Tolstoy, A Confession

This totally rocks. It's written in a very relaxed way, and is extremely interesting. Highly reccommended.

"No DIVX Day?" Come on already! 

For those people out there who just don't seem to get it:

Why DIVX will never work:

1) It changes the way people look at "ownership".  When you buy a DIVX disc, you don't really own it, since you can only actually view it for 48 hours.  Theoretically, a lazy person (like...me) could have a closet filled with useless discs.

2) (here's a big one): All titles are pan & scan. That's right, all titles are pan & scan.  They decided that since they were aiming for the renter's market, letterboxing would be a mistake.  Funny, when you consider that Paramount has confirmed they are doing a Titanic DIVX disc (although a DVD version has been shown, it has no release planned atm). Who's going to buy a pan & scan version of that?

3) Fox isn't officially involved. Fox's deal hinges on whether or not DIVX can claim at least 25% of the rental market in their test areas. This will never happen.

4) DVD is already a success.  DVD-ROMS are everywhere, and DVDs sold three times more players in their first 12 months than CDs, and already there is a 1/5th as many DVD players out there (in 14 months) as LaserDiscs, which have been around for 15 years.

5) DIVX has none of the "flash" that DVD has. No menus (they're all pre-configured), no extras, no squat.

6) DIVX is too much of an obvious marketing ploy. When you buy a DIVX player, you create a DIVX account.  Meaning they can track every disc you buy, and sell that info to marketing companies as they like.

7) To educators, DIVX is useless. It's pointless for a school district to invest in players, when they offer little, if any advantage over VHS, and LD and DVD players are much more ideally suited.

8) This one comes from Roger Ebert: there are two markets that keep video stores alive. Children, and buyers of porno movies.  Neither of which is going to be too likely to start a DIVX account.

9) And most importantly, NOBODY WILL CARRY IT. Period. I live next to J&R Music World, one of the largest DVD retailers in the US, and they are flat out refusing to carry DIVX, as is just about EVERY major electronics company except for Best Buy.


So give up the damn "No DIVX day".  All you're doing is giving it more exposure than it needs. 

BTW: If anyone out there is having a hard time finding the L.A. Confidential: SE disc that shipped in limited supplies today, J&R got 'em in en masse. 

Quotes for the heck of it:
