Okay...so i'm bandwagon hopping. Sue me. 

I just read this GameCenter article and here's my rundown of reactions.

Let's start with the basics here. Direct3D underrated? Yeah, there's something that we haven't had shoved down our throats for the last few years.  Simple rule: anything from Microsoft can not, by definition, be underrated. 

Quake II. Was I disappointed? Not really.  I got what I expected.  Do I agree with whatever that magazine was that said "the greatest game ever"?  No, of course not, you morons. 

Dolby: overrated. Uh huh.  "3D positional audio simply needs more than two speakers".  In a word...bullshit.  Positional audio (A3D) was created to simulate multiple channels across two speakers.  That's what it does, and does well.  Is it the same as having a 9 channel cinema DSP system?  Hell no...but for the average joe, it's a hell of a lot better than that lame-o AWE64.

AGP.  Can someone out there who owns an AGP card honestly tell me that it's a disappointment? Please?  I'm sorry, but AGP isn't supposed to part the waters, or anything...it's just a major improvement over PCI.

Analog Controls: underrated.  MY ASS. This has gotten more press than AGP, Dolby, and certainly lame Star Trek games combined.  The N64 ships with analog, the new PSX packages do as well, and the DreamCast has one built in. 

Considering that of all the online gaming sites, GameCenter is the most shameless when it comes to senseless hype, this whole thing seemed like a desperate plea for attention.  Sorry guys, but when you do what, three, four, separate previews of Daikatana in a year, don't turn around and say the thing is overhyped.  That's just plain sad.
