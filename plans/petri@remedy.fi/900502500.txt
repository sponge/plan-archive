Plan:
Yes, it's true.

We are looking for a highly talented, skilled, motivated, 
experienced level designer to join us in our effort of
making Max Payne a game that will rock the world.

Note: This opening is not for novices, if you don't have
experience in level design, you'd better wait. Later on 
there will be employment opportunities for newbies as well.

Anyways, if you think that you are capable of creating
the most photo-realistic environments ever, have an
utmost grasp of killer gameplay and know what is the
'magic' that draws the player back to the game again
and if you like to work hard to achieve the perfection
in both gameplay and visual areas, we would love to 
welcome you to our team.

If you think you have what it takes and are willing to 
relocate to Finland, send CV and work samples (preferably 
QII or Unreal levels) straight to petri@remedy.fi. Please 
enter "Level Designer" as the subject of the message.
