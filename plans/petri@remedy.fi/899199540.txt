Plan:
Just saw someone doubting that Max Payne E3 showing was more 
'smoke and mirrors' than actual game development. The funny 
thing is that the remark came from a person who hadn't even
seen the game running real time ;) 

This is something I'd like to set straight: when preparing for E3
we chose to do a video of Max to show on the main floor and
show the actual development in the backroom demo. This approach
was chosen specifically to avoid any 'E3 Demo syndrome' from 
happening (it seems to be common practice to spend even months
polishing up a demo for the show, which essentially is away 
from the normal development). So all in all, we ended up
working 3 days to get the video done in time, and avoided 
quick & dirty hacks. The stuff that was shown in the backroom 
was an actual snapshot of the development phase we were during E3.

To sum it up, the technology that was shown at E3 is solid
(as I think anyone who saw briefly the tools we've developed
for the game will confirm) and we've invested immense amounts 
of time and effort to really create an environment that allows 
for flexible and strong game-development. If this also happens 
to look visually good enough the get the CEOs of other companies 
nervous I would figure we're on the right track here :-)
