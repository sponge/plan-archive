Mika Tammenkoski has finally joined Maxteam. Mika is a programmer
whom we've worked with before and he's a really valued addition to 
the team. Mika's first task is to write KF2.0 Plugin to replace
our old and dated scripting system. The new Plugin allows
us to assign all the texture mapping, and materials etc. for 
actors right within 3D Studio Max, and then export those as
run-time data. It's a really nifty tool and gives us great 
flexibility in regard to actor data.

Mika's personal bio will be updated to www.maxpayne.com devteam 
section shortly.

We've also decided on the Level Designer (we're currently in the 
process of relocating him to Finland), more info on that later though. 
Huge thanks to all of the applicants. Your submissions we're all 
carefully previewed (and we had real fun playing through your levels :). 
It now seems clear that there's some serious talent out there crunching
away during night hours designing levels with QuakeII and other 
platforms. Keep up the good work guys.
