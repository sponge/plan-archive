Just back from an eventful weekend in Dallas. We ended up not
even qualifying in the CPL Counterstike tourney due to a carefully
placed "cheap shot" with a styr scout... shot straight through three
people to win the game! What the luck! If it were not for that one
shot we may have tied and gone on to sudden death. Good game [DL] guys!

Thanks to GOD for the wonderful treat at the level designers
conference. Mustaine and Levelord were about 10 minutes into thier
carefully prepared spiel when in walk two strippers... they came in,
did there thing and took off. Then about 10 minutes later they were
back again and this followed by about 250 people all wanting to
experience what we had just seen not 15 minutes ago. So much for the
level design conference. I am sure there are pictures and even video
of this all over the place, everyone in the joint had a camera.

Despite the odds, I survived my first trip to a rifle range with
Benson, Preston, Tom Mustaine and Joe and Aaron from Rogue. What a
great time... and no injuries or deaths! Tom had a Duke Nukem shotgun
he had never fired and I gave that a whirl. Pretty slick. Joe had
brought along an entire arsonal including a .45 and AR-15. I put quite
a few rounds through each and still no injuries or deaths! All in all
it was a great time... and no injuries or deaths!

Congrats to Rogue for their work on Alice, some of the wickedest
shader/level script effects I have ever seen!
