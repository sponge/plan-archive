Thanks to everyone who enjoyed our E3 demo and nominated us for
awards! I know I am a little late, but we really do appreciate it.
Thanks! =)

Anyone else get a chance to see the State of Emergency game at E3?
What a cool game! I must have gone back to play it 3 or 4 times
before we left. I have not been able to find much info about it on
the web, but being a big fan of hop-in-and-blow-stuff-up style
action games i am looking forward to this ones release.

We just moved. Our new home rocks... I am still trying to adjust.
If i EVER get around to finishing my personal website then i will
post some pictures. Back to work.
