Wow ... this is still here.  Guess I'll take a moment to get this off my chest.

FYI:  I never saw any mention of this from GSI, so I wanted to mention that Spy Software, Inc. sold the rights to GameSpy 3D a couple of years ago to GSI.  We (Spy Software, Inc.) haven't been involved with GameSpy 3D for quite some time now.  We were never involved with the development of GameSpy Arcade.
