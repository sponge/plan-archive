I cook and eat my inner child. The taste of its long-dead flesh stings like venom on my tongue.

"You went to school where you were taught to fear and to obey, be cheerful, fit in, or somebody might think you're weird. Life can be perfect, people can be trusted. Someday, I will finally have a nice quiet home of my very own  free from all pain, happy and having fun, all the time. It never happened, did it?"

  I like monkeys. The pet store was selling them for five cents a piece. I thought that odd since they were normally a couple thousand. I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth. I bought 200. I like monkeys.

I took my 200 monkeys home. I have a big car. 
I let one drive. His name was Sigmund. He was retarded. In fact,none of them were really bright. They kept punching themselves in their genitals. I laughed. Then they punched
my genitals. I stopped laughing.

I herded them into my room. They didn't adapt very well to their new environment. They would screech, hurl themselves off of the couch at high speeds and slam into
the wall. Although humorous at first, the spectacle lost its novelty halfway into its third hour.

Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so inexpensive: they all died. No apparent reason. They all just sorta' dropped dead. Kinda' like when you buy a
goldfish and it dies five hours later. Damn cheap monkeys.

I didn't know what to do. There were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my room, on the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase. It looked like I had 200 throw rugs.

I tried to flush one down the toilet. It didn't work. It got stuck. Then I had one dead, wet monkey and 199 dead,
dry monkeys.

I tried pretending that they were just stuffed animals. That worked for a while, that is until they began to decompose.
It started to smell real bad.

I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in the toilet and I didn't want to call the plumber. I was embarrassed.

I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them. Unfortunately, there was only enough room for two monkeys at a time so I had to change them every 30 seconds. I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so it
didn't all go bad.

I tried burning them. Little did I know my bed was flammable. I had to extinguish the fire.

Then I had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen monkeys in my freezer, and 197 dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my bed. The odor wasn't improving.

I became agitated at my inability to dispose of my monkeys and to use the bathroom. I severely beat one of my monkeys. I felt better.

I tried throwing them away but the garbage man said that the city was not allowed to dispose of charred primates. I told him that I had a wet one. He couldn't take that one
either. I didn't bother asking about the frozen ones.

I finally arrived at a solution. I gave them out as Christmas gifts. My friends didn't know quite what to say. They pretended that they like them, but I could tell they were
lying. Ingrates. So I punched them in the genitals.

I like monkeys. 

 From The Technology Impaired Department:

  While working at Radio Shack about ten years ago this lady came in and was hopping mad!  She had purchased a telephone 30 days prior and now wanted a refund.  The other sales people could not calm her down enough to make sense of her, so one of them came in the back to get me.
  I came out and asked her what the problem was.  She screamed; "I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!"  I told her that was not a problem and began writing up the refund ticket.  I was curious as to what could prompt this woman to be so mad at her telephone, so I said; "Miss, what happened with this phone to
make you this mad?"  She replied; "I STILL GOT MY PHONE BILL!!!".

 I replied;"...and?"

She replied; "IT'S A CORDLESS PHONE!!!!"

She had been on the phone for a month calling all her long distance friends and talking for hours because she thought it would be free since the phone was cordless.

This actually happened at Radio Shack in Eastridge Mall - Gastonia, North Carolina in 1989.
