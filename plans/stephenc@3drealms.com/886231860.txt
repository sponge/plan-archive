I cook and eat my inner child. The taste of its long-dead flesh stings like venom on my tongue.

"You went to school where you were taught to fear and to obey, be cheerful, fit in, or somebody might think you're weird. Life can be perfect, people can be trusted. Someday, I will finally have a nice quiet home of my very own  free from all pain, happy and having fun, all the time. It never happened, did it?" 
     (Intro to "Government Flu", by the Dead Kennedys on the album "Plastic Surgery Disasters")


Demon Possession Handbook: "I found your article interesting. When the OJ Simpson thing started, I got this gut feeling , , , that the reason for the double murder had to do with demon possession. People would comment on the "look" in OJ's eyes. It just hit me like a ton of bricks that this is what it is. Another story in the news is the Marv Albert trial. The "biting" thing struck me as something straight from Hell -- something demonic. These are the two right off the top of my head but I have had other times when this has come to my mind. Just when you think you have heard the worst story on the news, there's another one -- all, in my opinion, having to do with demon possession. Maybe even the kid from Padukca who killed 3 classmates while they were praying."


  There ya go folks, decapitate your ex and Some Guy you apparently Don't Know and blame it on "Demonic Possession". How fortuitous to have someone who apparently imposes upon us how to live and a method of shirking Responsibilities as well. Watch the funny puppets dance, see how they frisk and caper! 

 Sleep.
