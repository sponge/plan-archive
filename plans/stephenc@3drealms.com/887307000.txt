I cook and eat my inner child. The taste of its long-dead flesh stings like venom on my tongue.

"You went to school where you were taught to fear and to obey, be cheerful, fit in, or somebody might think you're weird. Life can be perfect, people can be trusted. Someday, I will finally have a nice quiet home of my very own  free from all pain, happy and having fun, all the time. It never happened, did it?" 
     (Intro to "Government Flu", by the Dead Kennedys on the album "Plastic Surgery Disasters")

  BattleZone rocks! Well, single player at least, unfortunately multiplayer doesn't seem to be in the demo. I'm hoping this will be addressed in the near future.


  "Blessed are the strong, for they shall possess the Earth.
   Cursed are the weak, for they shall inherit the yoke.

    - Ragnar Redbeard, 1896
