I cook and eat my inner child. The taste of its long-dead flesh stings like venom on my tongue.

"You went to school where you were taught to fear and to obey, be cheerful, fit in, or somebody might think you're weird. Life can be perfect, people can be trusted. Someday, I will finally have a nice quiet home of my very own  free from all pain, happy and having fun, all the time. It never happened, did it?"

New Stuff for Jan 21st:

You are now ordered to go here Now:
http://www.texnet.net/lcota/

This is a Waste of Netspace run by an old friend of mine. I've oft pondered opening my own such page, but have never been afforded the opportunity. Now that I have the means and audience (?) to do so, perhaps I should reconsider. In the meantime, go to his site and read everything that I would have written had I wrote it. Or Something.

New Stuff for Jan 23rd:

 Played Jailbreak Quake 2 MOD tonight to 666 frags. As Cartman would say, "Kick Ass!". Play this mod. Now.

Jan 23rd Part II:

 I just got my painted porcelein Duke Nukem statue and it of course rocks.. I dunno how much they are (spoiled, yep), but they are extremely cool and detailed and I highly recommend if you Have The Means to pick one up. We are currently comparing edition numbers, I got #62 of 5800, I'll look around to see who has the #69 and let ya know.
