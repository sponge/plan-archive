Wow, no update for 3 months.  Shame on me.

DIVX is dead!

I was going to put a picture I found somewhere out on the web (a while ago) on my web page, but since DIVX is dead, my plan file might just have to suffice.

DVD vs. DIVX

Oh, and for those who responded to my previous .plan .. I got real busy.
Don't worry, I'm not ignoring things.  Also, there were no endorsements
implied in the four I listed .. the were just the four domains that hit
our fingerd in the time that it took me to write the update.

I've been thinking about this plan file thing.  The way the data is collected
is remarkably inefficient.  We're getting checked by multiple servers pretty
much continuously .. yet our plan files don't change but once every few days.

So, we're consuming all that bandwidth (with .plan files getting up in size,
like mine was) and all that server time (on both ends) so we can get updates
within 15 minutes.  Seems kinda silly.

Is there a better solution?

Why don't we change the way the system works?  Instead, how about we have our
servers tell the web page servers when we update?  I can write a program
in 5 minutes in perl that scans our .plan files (locally) for any changes
and mails them to a list of targets, should any changes occur.  Hmmm.  This
sounds good .. only use the bandwidth when there's a real change, instead
of continuously banging on our server every 15 minutes.  Sure, our server
will make itself busy for .. gosh .. 15 seconds while it scans the files
(and I'm being generous).

If any of you .plan file server folks are out there and reading this .. let
me know if we can set this up.  You know who you are (stomped, telefragged,
blues, pear, etc.)  It's a win for both sides.  Less work for you, less work
for us.

And no, I'm not going to set it up for just anyone.
