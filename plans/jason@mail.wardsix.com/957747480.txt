Hello, again, world.  :)

For a while Ward Six has been pretty quiet.  We have released part of our free total conversion (look for a review on Telefragged.com this week).  The second part of this release is in the works.

There have been some major upheavals and changes as well.  The best of this is that we're about to unveil our new game engine.  No details yet, but it's going to be impressive!  You'll surely hear from our lead technology programmer soon.

Additionally, we have presentation materials ready for publishers which will accompany our technology demo for Dawn of Darkness: The 7th Seer.  This also foreshadows the opening of a new website dedicated to the project.

Until the next update, come and visit us!
