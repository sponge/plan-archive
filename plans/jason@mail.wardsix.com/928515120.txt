Plan:
Testing 1,2,3..  still having trouble updating these plans!

One tiny infobit:  The Dawn of Darkness beta demo is on the July issue of PC Gamer UK, for those who might want to check it out without having to download 11+ megs.

We'll also be in the next issue of PC Accelerator (in the US), so watch out for more info on that.

Until next update,
