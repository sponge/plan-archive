Amidst all the chaos of E3 and the great (and deserved) reaction 
that Mike and the Unreal 2 team are getting, my game design book 
finally appeared on store shelves.

It's called "Game Design:  The Art and Business of Creating Games"
and  it's now also available on Amazon.com and 
Barnes&Noble.com, whose editors gave it a very kind review.
