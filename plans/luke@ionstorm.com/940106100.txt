The following are my own twisted views.
Oh.. My spelling and grammer blows.


=========== October 16, 1999 ================

Well hardcore crunch mode has set in, as things move towards the Christmas release
date... Must... work....

Fight Club: See it.. Thats all I can say.

On the level design side of things i've just finished up e3m6 and tweeked e4m5 a bit more
to be sent to QA. Past that I'm cleaning up e3m1, and e3m2. Things are proceding at 
blistering pace :)

=========== September 6, 1999 ================

Hmm, Labor Day... That means I'm supposed to be working right?

As John mentioned on irc most of our time is currently going towards wrapping up 
the press demo. I ended up not having much work to do towards cleaning up
e1m3, so i'm currently starting work on e4m6. All the rest of my maps are in
QA's hands, awaiting bug fixes. Things be looking good!
