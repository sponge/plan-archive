What is Scott's Fun Information Finger?
The thing you're reading, stupid!
What is in Scott's Fun Information Finger?
Lots of useless stuff that makes me giggle.
Why should I care about Scott's Fun Information Finger?
Hell if I know.  Go read someone else's finger!


WORD OF THE DAY:
Gib.let (jib'lit) n. [ME gibelet]
1. Any various editable parts of a foul, as the heart neck or gizzard, that are cooked separately or are used in making gravy.
2. Any chunk of bloody body tissue resulting from a frag; esp. vital organs or bone fragments emanating from a exploding body.  Made popular from comments in the source code of DOOM.
[See also gib, frag, telefrag, dirt-nap, hanging with Elvis, bullet kissing, sudden deceleration trauma, buckshot enema]


USELESS FACT OF THE DAY:
A group of goldfish is collectively called a "troubling".
I don't know why this is, but have you ever seen a tank full of goldfish? Ever notice how they stare back at you?  As if they are daring you to start something?  Like they're saying, "You and me, punk!  Lets go!"
Maybe it's just me.


RANT OF THE DAY:
Does anybody actually read manuals?  I believe they are only good for two things: weighing down the box so the buyer thinks they are getting more for their money, and for the customer support numbers to tell them where to get the inevitable game patch.
Do I sound bitter?
That's only because I'm writing our manual now.
I promise to make it REALLY thick and have lots of ways to contact customer support.


THOUGHT OF THE DAY:
Legos are cool.  (And they retain their shape when placed in the microwave)
