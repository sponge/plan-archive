You are but feeble minded servants, and I will now prove my power over you!
To demonstrate my ability, answer the following questions, slowly scrolling
downward, one at a time.  DO NOT skip ahead.  I will reveal my knowledge and
power at the very end!  You have been warned...

1)  Pick a integer number from 1-9, you idiot... HA HA HA








2)  Subtract 5 from that number (if the resulting answer is negative, make it
positive by dropping the negative sign--don't be a bonehead, either)








3)  Multiply by 3, you fool!








4)  Square the number, and don't be a square yourself!  (Multiply your number
by your number, i.e. for the brain dead:  9 times 9)








5)  Quit annoying me and add the separate digits together until you get only
one digit (i.e.  64=6+4=10 then 10=1+0=1)








6)  If the number is less than 5, add five.  Otherwise subtract 4.  If this
step is too hard, you're too stupid for me to control your feeble mind.








7)  Multiply by 2.  You can do that, right?








8)  Subtract 6 you nimrod.  Not 5, not 7, just 6!








9)  Okay, it's about to get tough:  Map the digit to a letter in the alphabet
1=A, 2=B, 3=C, 4=D, 5=E, etc...








10) Pick a name of a country that begins with that letter.  (You don't need
a stinking globe do you, moron!?)








11) Take the second letter in the country name and think of a mammal that
begins with that letter.  Duhhh, like a Rhino or a Zebra...  A mammal ain't
no fish, or bird, you jerk!








12) Think of the color of that mammal.  And there ain't no pink mammals, you freak!












You were too easy....  Do not scroll any further until you've answer the above
test.  Below lies your feeble fate!















Okay, I'm telling you that your nothing but a feeble-minded, predictable, government programmed
automaton without self-actualized thought processes of your own.  You have
been manipulated throughout your entire life in such a way that your
self-realized, wantonly phallic, ego-driven consciousness has been
played the fool in thinking you actually make your own choices, guide your own
destiny, when in fact you have been given no choice in your feeble pre-determined,
fateless life!  And that's why I know You Have A Grey Elephant From Denmark.

Now bow to me, you pitiful servant!

Halloween Day

Having our 3rd annual Halloween party today with a catered lunch (Italian food).

The Sega port of Duke Nukem 3D scored a 5/5 in one of England's top game mags.
The N64 version has already landed three covers.  Then you have the PlayStation
version coming in about a month and it has received exceptional previews, too.
Looks like Duke is dressing up as Santa this Xmas.  Ho ho ho.  :)

This week's UPDATED puzzle:  You are blindfolded.  You throw two dimes in the air and they
both land, bounce around, and come to rest flat.  A second person, an observer, tells you
that one of the dimes is heads-up (but doesn't tell you which dime).  What are the odds
that the other dime is also heads-up?  (And just to make sure you don't dismiss this
puzzle quickly, the answer is *not* 50%.)  Bonus:  What are the odds that the hidden dime
is tails-up?  (Note:  Thanks to everyone who pointed out my error in wording this puzzle
is a confusing and misleading way, which I've now corrected.)

Answers can typically be found at http://www.3dportal.com within a day or two.

Finally got a working copy of Fallout (had to take back a bad CD).  The cinematic
intro is one of the best I've seen, having a unique style, and a part that actually
gave me chills as the camera pulled back to show the "big picture" (I won't spoil it
for anyone).

However, at the same time, I hope one part of this intro is not a sign of things
to come.  Right before the intro starts, in big letters it says on the screen:
"Brian Fargo Presents".  (Brian Fargo is the head of Interplay.)  This has got to
be one of the most egotistical things in gaming, especially when you're not listed
among one of the game's five key designers.

This is Big Head syndrome combined with We-Want-To-Be-Hollywood syndrome at its
worst.  Please oh please don't let this catch on.  Games are team efforts (at
least around here), and there's no need for any single team member (or company
owner) to get their name listed "above the title," or separated from where the
other team members are listed.

For this same reason I've always been annoyed with rock bands that are named after
the lead singer, because it doesn't promote equality in the group, and that one
person typically gets too much of the credit.

Okay, some steam is released... back to the game.  ;)

Like Shadow Warrior or not, I recommend you spend a few minutes reading the first
chapter of the first Shadow Warrior novel, which is online at www.3drealms.com,
visit "Latest Apogee/3D Realms News!", then click on the book cover.  This chapter
is totally cool and hilarious--you will not be disappointed.

Bought Fallout, Lands of Lore and Ultima Online yesterday.  I rarely have time to
finish games I start, but I like to at least check them out to see if there are
any good ideas to use for inspiration (or to steal :).  Total Annihilation
continues to be a total blast.

Can't give any specifics, but there are several prominent developers interested
in licensing our Prey Technology.  We're going to restrict the number of licenses,
plus we're only going to license to companies who are doing games significantly
different to other licensees.  We're not interested in seeing a bunch of Prey clones.

Why the NFL rules over other spectator sports:  Each game actually means something.

Finally, answers to last weeks puzzles can be found at 3D Portal (http://www.3dportal.com/),
under the "October 20th, 1997" news heading.

This week's puzzle is a bit tougher, and one of my favorites:

There's a narrow railroad bridge crossing a deep chasm.  You're walking along it
having made it seven tenths of way so far, when suddenly you hear a train coming.
You know that this train always travels 50 mph, but because the area is mountainous
you're not sure which way the train is coming from.  Instantaneously reacting, you
randomly pick a direction to run and just dive off the bridge as the train roars by
you, almost killing you.  How fast (average speed) where you running to escape death?

Once again, please do not send me your answers or requests for the solution.
3D Portal typically has the solution online within a day or two.

Just got the Nov. issue of PC Gamer (448-packed pages!), which has Duke Nukem on
the cover and a 10-page info-packed spread on Duke Nukem Forever, along with several
sidebars on Prey, Max Payne and other subjects.  Jason Bates wrote this terrific
exclusive.  Folks, this article is all you're going to see about this game for many,
many months, except for maybe a rare screen shot here and there.  I highly recommend
that anyone at all remotely interested in Duke buy this issue.

The article was written before we made the decision to go with 16-bit source art,
which means these screen shots do not look nearly as good as the game currently
looks.  Also, there are a ton of break though ideas we're not mentioning publicly
until the game's release.  Our goal is not to over-expose and over-hype this game.

The article ends with this sentence:  "We're not fortune tellers, but we have every
confidence that Duke Nukem Forever will be the biggest--and perhaps the best--titles
of 1998."  That confidence is *not* misplaced.  ;)

New puzzle:

Let's play Let's Make A Deal!  Monty Hall asks you to pick one of three curtains.
Behind one curtain is a car, behind another is a sofa, and behind another is a goat.
Obviously, all you care about is getting the car.  Let's say you picked curtain #1.
Monty, who knows what's behind each curtain, opens up curtain #2 and reveals the sofa.
Then he turns to you and says, "Tell ya what... I'll let you stay with curtain #1, or
switch to curtain #3."  The question is:  Is it beneficial to switch?

Bonus puzzle:

A car goes one lap around a mile long oval track at 30 mph.  How fast does the car
need to go on a second lap to average 60 mph for both laps?

Once again, please do not send me your answers or requests for answers.  I'm too
busy to respond to everyone.  The answers will be posted here next Friday.  Good luck.  :)

Been watching people around the office play Jedi Knight.  Looks like a fun game
(great sound effects), though I wish the levels had better shadowing effects--the
lack of contrast gives the game a dated look.  However, LucasArts has a giant
advantage in having the Star Wars universe to base games on.  This advantage pretty
much insures that anything they do associated with Star Wars will be a big hit.
Must be nice.  ;)

Also, I'm looking forward to Activision's Battlezone.  The was an arcade favorite
of mine (I could play indefinitely on one quarter, and often played for hours at a
time hunting down those saucers).  The only problem I foresee is in recreating the
original Battlezone controls.  That's the problem with porting arcade hits like
Robotron, Missile Command and Tempest to the PC--without the original custom controls
those games are not nearly as fun to play.

We've got a lot of good feedback on the Shadow Warrior novels.  Unlike the DOOM novels,
which were widely panned, the Shadow Warrior novels encompass an entirely original story,
with ties back to the game.  We'll have the first chapter available on our web site very
soon.  If you liked the Destroyer series, you'll like the Shadow Warrior novels, too.

In stores soon with be the Duke Nukem Kill-o-Ton Collection, which puts in one oversized
box everything ever released relating to Duke Nukem, Duke Nukem 2, and Duke Nukem 3D.
This will be Duke's second Xmas--the game came out early in '96 and is still selling
better than most games recently released.  On CGW's "Playing Lately" list Duke 3D is at
position #6, and has been on the list 19 months straight, longer than any other game.
In Europe it's been #1 or #2 on the Budget Top Ten for six months straight.  In the
history of games, there's been maybe a handful that have sold more on a PC.  The N64
version already has store pre-orders over 300,000 in the USA alone.  The PSX version has
incredible pre-order numbers, too.  Things are looking good for Duke.  :)  Then there's
the collectors statue, action figures, novels, secret PSX project, Sega Duke, Tiger
Electronic's two Duke games, Genesis Duke, the movie, the Duke table in Balls of Steel,
and Duke Nukem Forever.  Maybe one day Duke will be bigger than Star Wars!  (Okay, you
can lock me up and throw away the key now.  )

An observation:  In the last two days I've read through the new Computer Gaming
World, Next Generation and PC Games magazines.  It occurred to me reading through
all the game previews that it's amazing how much attention games get before they're
even released.  It used to not be this way.

During the 80's and even early 90's most games were first mentioned in the reviews
section, after they were released.  Rarely were games previewed, or talked about
before their release.  One reason is because games mostly took 6 - 9 months to make,
so there was no reason to talk about a game before it was done.  Of course, now games
take about two years, so there's much more time to talk about them before they're
released.  Also, there wasn't the online game community like there is now, which
excites players into wanting to know more and more about games on the horizon.

Next Generation gives each previewed game at least a full page article, while their
reviews area rarely gives a game a full page, usually about a half-page.  Something
seems screwed up here, but I'm sure they know best what their readers want.  And what
we want is to quench our insatiable thirst to know what's ahead, and is it any better?

Let's hope so.

*  Soon after Duke 3D's release we were asked to do a PC game version of Men in Black,
which we turned down (games based on movies rarely do well, unless it's a Star Wars game).
Last week a major studio contacted us about doing a game based on a sure-hit futuristic
movie coming next summer (can't say the name, under NDA).  The problem is that we're
knee-deep in Prey and Duke 4, so these are not projects we can realistically get involved
with, but it's still fun to get the offers.
