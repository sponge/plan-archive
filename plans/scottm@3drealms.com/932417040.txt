This quote, from the Lead Programmer at UK game developer Elixir Studios
(www.elixir-studios.co.uk), needs a broader audience:

Describing players of first-person action games like Quake in the July 1, '99 issue of 
GameWEEK (page 8), Demis Hassabis said:  "[They are] geeky bedroom teenage boys who 
want a sense of power and who need to feel above the law."

FYI, Elixir Studios has partnered with Eidos for their first three games, the first coming in 
2000.  I for one am looking forward to playing their games as a diversion from my geeky 
teenage above-the-law power trip.

Thanks to video games, I'm an expert at many cool things!

I'm an expert marksman (thanks to first person shooters), I can also fly the space shuttle 
(thanks to Asteroids, Lunar Lander, Stargunner, Raptor, Terminal Velocity, many others), I 
can fly any aircraft (various flight simulators), run a small or large city (various Sim City 
games and sequels), beat up anyone in a one-on-one fight (Mortal Kombat, Virtua Fighter, 
Street Fighter, Tekken), manage an army in a war (various war games and real-time strategy 
games), lay bricks in any pattern as good as the best brick layers in the world (Tetris) and 
even play any major league sport alongside any of the pros! 

I owe it all to video & computer games!

One of the best game violence articles I've read:

www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/06/21/game_violence/index.html

========================================
The Day After:

Absolutely loved The Phantom Menace, EXCEPT for that entirely annoying Jar Jar character.  
What a complete and utter mistake to have that character in the movie.  Please, Lucas, let 
me review the next movie's script so that I can weed out mistakes like this and save you 
much embarrassment.

All of 3D Realms people who went to see the movie last night wore tee shirts we made that 
said "Jar Jar Must Die" and showed a picture of Jar Jar's head being lopped off with a light 
saber.  Dozens of people at the theater asked us were they could get the shirt.  Pictures of 
us in line wearing these shirts will be on our web site soon.

We're also going to open a movie review site, 3D Realms' style, at www.MovieSuckage.com, 
which will have short articles by 3D Realms people about major movies that unfortunately 
include utterly dumb things.  Message boards will be available for everyone to make their 
comments, too.  Should be fun.

I really hope LucasArts is smart enough to not make any games involving Jar Jar -- he's the 
new metaphor for failure.  Trespasser is now off the hook.

I hope everyone gets a chance to read these, regarding the recent senseless killing in Littleton:

Today I read one of the least intelligent remarks I've ever seen by a game developer, and
shockingly it came from a game designer I and others respect enormously, Shigeru Miyamoto,
most famous for Donkey Kong, the Mario Bros. series, and the Zelda series of games.

In the April 1, 1999 print issue of GamesBusiness (www.gamesbusiness.com) Miyamoto is
asked about the improved 3D graphics abilities of the coming PlayStation 2, and he replies
with a question:  "Will the improvement in hardware quality actually improve the quality of the
gameplay experience?"

Well, duh, yes!

Is Miyamoto really questioning whether advances in graphics open doors to advances in
gameplay?!

His own Mario and Zelda games on the N64 answer that question without any doubt.  Zelda
on the N64 is light years ahead of any previous Zelda, in terms of look and gameplay and total
experience.  Better graphics unquestionably give game developers more gameplay options.
(That's not to say that all developers take advantage of this fact, but that's an entirely
different issue!)

So why would he ask such a question?  Perhaps he's really just taking a dig at the PSX2
incredible specifications.  This is likely, because in that same article he says of those
specifications:  "Never trust what hardware manufacturers say."  Well, if we take his
experienced advice, then we should also be very skeptical of whatever specs Nintendo
releases for their next generation system too!  ; )

Update (4-2-1999):

Okay, most people didn't bite on this, BUT most people (over 100+ emails) thought it would be
a great idea!

April Fools Update:

The Phantom Menace:  Cool news...

One of the producers working on the Duke Nukem movie has seen a pre-screening of the
coming Star Wars epic, and told me about something too cool to not reveal (look the other 
way if you do not want to spoil a big surprise):

Harrison Ford has a cameo, playing none other than Han Solo's father!  We get to see the 
building of the Millenium Falcon, Han's father's ship (who names it during the movie).  I also 
heard that it's planned in the next movie that the ship ends up in Lando's possession, and in 
the third movie it's back in Han's possession.

Too cool!

This part is for real:  I just hope that The Phantom Menace isn't Muppets in Space, like the
previews sadly suggest.  Man, George, just get rid of the silly kid marketing stuff and make a
hard core, kick butt sci-fi movie like the first two Star Wars were.

Got this via email.  If anyone needs game ideas, we now have a source!!!

----------

Hello,

My name is [name withheld] and I own a game ideas development company.  I would like to co-operate
with you.  If you don't understand what we do here, I will explain.  What we do here in Creative Gamers
is create Game Ideas.  We create the game idea and then sell the rights to Game DEVELOPMENT
company's.  We sell 2 things in our company:
1) A game idea with some specific details - Low Price.
2) Create a full draft of a game, charachters, background, story and everything - Price varies according
to length of the game.
We want to work with you.  We produce ANY KIND of game in a very short time, the
longest time it took us to create a full draft for a game was 3 weeks and that was a 2 cd game.

Thank you very much.

P.S.  Please reply if you want more information like full price list or just a specific type of game, or just a
Yes or No.

I was just asked via email by one of the key producers behind the Duke Nukem movie what I
thought of Wing Commander.  Here's the answer I sent to that person:

"I saw it, and it rates as a good Saturday morning kid show script -- except
that it even bored my two kids! The special effects were good enough, but
the story and dialogue was embarrassing. There are so many easily fixable
problems with this movie it's just a real shame. This movie makes the
endless stupidity in Stormship Troopers look good!"

I could elaborate further about the dumbness of this movie, but it's best to forget the nightmare
and focus on the coming space movie that really matters...

Happy New Year to my family (Chana, Shane & Jace) and Everyone Worldwide!

Finished playing Heretic 2 today.  Very highly recommended!

I then tried to play Tomb Raider 3 and there's no way I can do it.  TR3's control method is so
 inferior to that of Heretic 2's (both are 3rd-person games) that I cannot regress that far--TR3 is 
far too frustrating to control.  The camera in TR3 rarely points the direction I want it to (i.e. the 
direction that Lara Croft is facing!!!), looking up and down is a complete chore, and the fact that 
TR3 doesn't support mouse control is an oversight of epic magnitude.  Max Payne's 3rd-person 
control will NOT be as horrible as TR3's, that I can promise!

Bottom line:  This game is more of a control issue than one of enjoying the actual gameplay, and 
for me that's not fun.

And finally, when will the graphics engine in the Tomb Raider series catch up to 1996 standards, 
let alone today's standards!  Sheesh, nothing is worse that looking at headache inducing 
misaligned textures.

Well, now that I'm giving up on TR3, looks like I get to finish Half-Life earlier than planned.  ; )

The above link points to a story about Gathering of Developers on Upside Today, a nice daily news 
site.

The story contains this paragraph:  >>>Ironically, the industry's largest third-party game 
producer, Electronic Arts, started with the same Hollywood studio/independent creator model that 
GOD now preaches. "EA started with the same philosophy as GOD," says legendary developer Sid 
Meier, who runs Hunt Valley, Md.-based Firaxis Inc., which has a deal to make games that EA will 
publish.<<<

I've heard this misconception about Gathering several times.  Here's why it's wrong:  Gathering has 
a board of directors comprised of mostly developers.  The purpose of this developer-oriented board  
is to insure that Gathering does not become a publisher in which developer issues and concerns 
become secondplace priorities.

No other publisher has a board of directors comprised of developers that is setting company policy 
and vision.  Already several times this board has made policies and decisions that are in favor of 
developers, where at other publishers these decisions would have gone in favor other the 
corporation.

EA did not have a developer oriented board of directors to make sure their developer-oriented 
vision stayed in place, and that's why Gathering will succeed as a developer-oriented publisher 
where others have failed.

In the same article, Richard Hilleman, a VP at EA, says, "The more things change, the more they 
stay the same."  Hilleman is of course as wrong as Meier.  A publisher like the Gathering of 
Developers has been never attempted before, with proven developers helping to run the company
and maintain developer priorities.  With the Gathering it's the first time it's not Developers vs Suits, 
because the developers in this case are the suits.

The current PC Gamer and other recent magazine editions have run articles listing the best 50 or 
100 games of all time.  My concern is that these lists often don't include older, groundbreaking 
games.  For example, should not a game like Wolfenstein 3-D be included because it kicked-off the 
3D first-person shooter genre?  Should not Myst be a lock because it's the best selling game of all 
time, and therefore the most popular game in PC history?  And how can any such list omit 
revolutionary and great games like M.U.L.E., and Wing Commander, and Tetris?!

Any Best Games Ever list without these games can't be a Best Games Ever list.

Wolfenstein 3-D is outdated and surpassed by six years of technically better 3D shooters.  Same 
with the other games listed above.  And that's the problem with these lists:  They often don't take 
into account how influential and innovative a game was for its time.  Instead, these lists mostly 
comprise themselves with games released in the past few years.  Do lists of the Best Novels Ever 
or Best Movies Ever only contain recent titles?  Absolutely not.

This is why I prefer Computer Gaming World magazine's Hall of Fame over lists of the Best Games 
Ever.  A Hall of Fame ignores games that are current hits and recognizes games that stand the 
test of time, impact the industry and influence their genre.  Best Games Ever lists contain too 
many games that come and go, but once a game makes the Hall of Fame list, it's there forever, 
and for good reason.

I'm not sure who would manage it, but I'd like to see an industry sanctioned Hall of Fame.  The 
SPA (Software Publishers Association) seems like an obvious choice to handle this, except they've 
shown themselves to be utterly inept with their annual Codie Awards, an industry farce that 
should be put to death like an annoying mosquito.

Unless something more official is formed, the CGW Hall of Fame will likely remain the best listing of 
our industry's best games, especially from a historical perspective.

A few people have reminded me that many months ago I said that I'd write about
the negative effects that realistic and improved graphics have had on the game
industry.  I guess it's time to pontificate.  Who knows, I might even have a
valid point or two--sometimes I get lucky that way.

Let's get this straight:  Everyone loves the improved graphics we're seeing in
today's games.  The key problem is that too often developers focus on graphics
and lose focus gameplay issues.

This is why most FMV (full motion video) games fell flat on their pompous
faces.  This is why the convergence of Hollywood and Silicon Valley won't
revolutionize the game industry.  This is why Rocket Science never had a
chance.

Spin the date dial back to the late 70's and early 80's, when graphics were
1-bit, we're talking black and white, but included masterworks like Asteroids,
Space Invaders, Space War, Battlezone, and Pong.  Other 1-bit games used<
