The people who are college freshmen entering this Millennium ("don't be a math geek" --
Mulder to Scully) were born in or around 1982.  To show how fast things change, ponder 
these...

They have no meaningful recollection of the Reagan Era and probably did not know he had 
ever been shot.

There has been only one Pope.

They were 11 when the Soviet Union broke apart and do not remember the Cold War. They 
have never feared a nuclear war.

They are too young to remember the space shuttle blowing up.

Tianamen Square means nothing to them.

Their lifetime has always included AIDS.

Bottle caps have always been screw off and plastic bottles.  They have no idea that the tabs 
on soda cans used to come off.

Vinyl albums are museum artifacts. The expression you sound like a broken record means 
nothing to them. They have never owned a record player.  They've never heard a stuck song 
on the radio.

The Compact Disc was introduced when they were 1 year old.

Atari predates them.  They have likely never played Pac Man and only know of Pong as some 
old game, but they've never played it.

As far as they know, stamps have always cost about 33 cents.

They have always had an answering machine.  They may ask, Why do we call it a dial tone--
there's no dial?!

Most have never seen a TV set with only 13 channels, nor have they seen a black-and-white 
TV. They have always had cable. There has always been VCRs, but they have no idea what 
BETA is. They cannot fathom not having a remote control.

They were born the year that Walkman were introduced by Sony.

Roller-skating has always meant inline for them.

Jay Leno has always been on the Tonight Show.  They'll never know the superior greatness of 
Johnny Carson.

They have no idea when or why Jordache jeans were cool.

Popcorn has always been cooked in the microwave.

They have never seen Larry Bird play.

They never took a swim and thought about Jaws.

The Vietnam War is as ancient history to them as WWI, WWII and the Civil War.  They were 
prepubescent when the Persian Gulf War was waged.

They have no idea that Americans were ever held hostage in Iran, or that Nightline with Ted 
Copple was originally just a special news show to cover this crisis.

They can't imagine what hard contact lenses are.

They don't know who Mork was or where he was from.  They do not care who shot J.R. and 
have no idea who J.R. is.

The Titanic was found? They thought we always knew where it was.

Michael Jackson has always been white.  Kansas, Chicago, Boston, America, and Alabama are 
places, not musical groups.  Pink Floyd -- isn't he dead?

McDonalds never came in Styrofoam containers.

There has always been MTV.  They've never known a time before rap music.

They don't have a clue how to use a typewriter.

They do not remember a world without affordable home computers.


Now, before anyone gets cocky, remember that for every generation, I know the previous generation can write a similar list.  ;-)  And in 15-20 years, the current college generation will 
have similar amazing things to write about the generation entering college at that time.

Xmas Eve, 1999

Lonely day at the office.  Since when did Christmas Eve become a non-work day? ;-)

I guess most people use today to get those last-second gifts.  This year I got practically all 
my gifts via online stores weeks ago.  For the most part things went well...

Amazon.com is easily the best place to order from online.  They make buying quicker or more
convenient than any other e-store I've used.  All of the Buy.com stores are also 
recommended.  On the other hand, www.Living.com still hasn't sent me all of my order that I 
placed mid-Nov.  Avoid that place at all costs.

www.EddieBauer.com hasn't quite figured out online commerce, either.  I placed an order with 
them and two days later they called me, leaving a voice message for me to return their call 
(without saying why).  Normally, I don't return calls like this, but luckily this time I did.  Turns 
out they were calling me to verify my address, and if I'd not called back they would not have 
shipped my order(!!!), and several of my family would have missed out on their presents.  No 
other site I've used calls back to verify the address!?  What's the point of taking advantage 
of the convenience of online ordering if you're going to be called back?  I ended up having an 
email conversation with the CEO if Eddie Bauer, and it's rather apparent she's old school and 
doesn't get It.

I ordered a few kid's toys from www.ZanyBrainy.com and after waiting two weeks for them to 
arrive, I checked my account and it looks like my order was never processed.  Maybe I should 
have e-shopped at eToys.com instead.

Finally, though not Xmas shopping related, I tried www.NetGrocier.com, ordering about $16 
worth of house supplies, and shipping came to $8!  Not only was that outrageous, but you'd 
think that NetGrocier.com would have cheaper prices (making the shipping easier to swallow)
since they do to not having actual stores, but you'd be thinking wrong.

Finally, a firm we work with sent us some cookies this week, and I've never had better 
cookies that weren't freshly home made.  Check out www.BrentAndSams.com, and specifically 
the Chocolate Chip Pecan and Key Lime/White Chocolate cookies.  You can easily order from 
this site and also send tins of these cookies (and several other varieties) as gifts.

My personal favs for 1999:

Movie:  Being John Malkovich

PC Game:  Unreal Tournament

Non-Fiction Book:  The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding

Music CD:  Jeff Beck's "Who Else!"

TV show:  X-Files.

Anyway, Merry Christmas and a Safe New Years to all, especially Shane and Jace.  (Visit 
www.3drealms.com to see our Xmas card.)

Next year should be quite exciting for 3D Realms...

An article about video game violence that desputes much of the
extreme preaching of Lieutenant Colonel David Grossman, who's
unfortunately become the press' favorite "expert" source.

A few comments on recent releases...

[1]  The new Space Invaders (I played the PlayStation version, but there's also a PC version) 
is the best rebirth of an old arcade game I've played.  This game maintains the simple concept 
of the original, while adding many new features, power-ups and even boss stages.  For any 
and all Space Invader old-timers, this one is worth your time.

[2]  Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation -- One of the most frustrating games I've seen and 
played recently, and I will not play it anymore because of the insane unfairness it throws at 
players.  First, the map designers must think that darkness is a cool way to hide new areas of 
the game, because this game uses dark areas like it's the last revelation of game design.  
Second, there are places in the game where the solution is not indicated in anyway, and 
doesn't even make any sense.  For example, there's a room underwater and the solution is to 
find the small hole in the ceiling quickly, otherwise it's death by drowning.  The catch is that 
the ceiling is entirely covered with a ceiling texture, and it's only by a total fluke that the 
"hole" in the ceiling (you poke your head through the ceiling!!!) is discovered.  Finally, is it 
asking too much to have an optional mode in the game that keeps the camera pointing in the 
direction of the character?!  I find that about 30% of the time the game has the camera 
looking off in some useless direction off to the side of my character.  This is a third-person 
perspective game in which that third-person cameraman isn't doing his job.

Other than these idiotic design flaws, TR4 is a pretty darn good game.  Although, I am willing 
to bet that for the majority of younger players (10 and younger), this game is far, far too 
difficult, mainly because many puzzle solutions are non-logical and rely on dumb luck and 
dedicated perseverance rather than Indiana Jones-type skills.

[3]  Tried playing the Ultima Ascension slide show, too.  Now here's a game that was released 
ahead of it's time.  Hopefully my coming GeForce 3D card will enable my P3-500 to play this 
game in a real-time mode.  ;-)  The review of this game on www.avault.com pretty much 
mirrored my experience.

[4]  Bought a Dreamcast recently and played quite a bit of Sonic Adventure.  One thing's for 
certain, Sonic ain't in the same league as Mario anymore.  This game seems like it was rushed, 
and it changed Sonic's character personality for the worse.  Even though Sonic Adventure 
has better graphics by far, give me N64's Mario 64 or Zelda because gameplay beats flash.

[5]  Unreal Tournament takes the honor of being the first game of the new genre of 3D 
multiplayer bot games and pulls it off to near perfection.  Congrats go to Epic.  Haven't played 
the full version of QA3 yet, still haven't found in it a store.  I've been watching the debates 
regarding QA3's server key validation because Duke Nukem Forever will likely use some form of 
copy protection too.  Software theft (mostly casual theft, such a making a copy for a friend, 
family member, or co-worker) has become such a huge problem that developers and publishers 
can no longer release games without protection of some sort.  Hit games used to sell many 
more copies than they do nowadays, and a good part of the dramatic drop must be due to 
the proliferation of CD-ROM burners.

Oct. 8, 1999

Computer Games Magazine, Nov. 1999 issue, page B26, ("10 Essential First-Person
Shooters" by Steve Bauman, Editor-at-Large).

Duke Nukem 3D is listed among a hall-of-fame list of ten 3D shooters, although I 
would have put Wolfenstein 3-D in this list ahead of Outlaws, but that's not the 
thing that needs correcting, that's just a minor blunder.

Far worse is this statement by Bauman:  "[Duke Nukem 3D's] most unfortunate legacy 
is the wise-cracking lead character (most of which was cribbed verbatim from Army 
of Darkness)..."

Hmmm, most lines taken from Army of Darkness?  Not even close.  Of the 100+ lines 
that Duke speaks in the game, there are only three, maybe four lines from AofD.  
The only three we can think of are "Hail to the king, baby," "Who wants some" and 
"Groovy."  Big whoop.  We borrowed several lines from other movies, too, but the 
vast majority of Duke-isms were created by us.  It looks like Bauman's attempt to 
blast Duke resulted in a self frag.

The above link points to a story about Gathering of Developers on Upside Today, a nice daily news 
site.

The story contains this paragraph:  >>>Ironically, the industry's largest third-party game 
producer, Electronic Arts, started with the same Hollywood studio/independent creator model that 
GOD now preaches. "EA started with the same philosophy as GOD," says legendary developer Sid 
Meier, who runs Hunt Valley, Md.-based Firaxis Inc., which has a deal to make games that EA will 
publish.<<<

I've heard this misconception about Gathering several times.  Here's why it's wrong:  Gathering has 
a board of directors comprised of mostly developers.  The purpose of this developer-oriented board  
is to insure that Gathering does not become a publisher in which developer issues and concerns 
become secondplace priorities.

No other publisher has a board of directors comprised of developers that is setting company policy 
and vision.  Already several times this board has made policies and decisions that are in favor of 
developers, where at other publishers these decisions would have gone in favor other the 
corporation.

EA did not have a developer oriented board of directors to make sure their developer-oriented 
vision stayed in place, and that's why Gathering will succeed as a developer-oriented publisher 
where others have failed.

In the same article, Richard Hilleman, a VP at EA, says, "The more things change, the more they 
stay the same."  Hilleman is of course as wrong as Meier.  A publisher like the Gathering of 
Developers has been never attempted before, with proven developers helping to run the company
and maintain developer priorities.  With the Gathering it's the first time it's not Developers vs Suits, 
because the developers in this case are the suits.

Sept. 18, 1998

The current PC Gamer and other recent magazine editions have run articles listing the best 50 or 
100 games of all time.  My concern is that these lists often don't include older, groundbreaking 
games.  For example, should not a game like Wolfenstein 3-D be included because it kicked-off the 
3D first-person shooter genre?  Should not Myst be a lock because it's the best selling game of all 
time, and therefore the most popular game in PC history?  And how can any such list omit 
revolutionary and great games like M.U.L.E., and Wing Commander, and Tetris?!

Any Best Games Ever list without these games can't be a Best Games Ever list.

Wolfenstein 3-D is outdated and surpassed by six years of technically better 3D shooters.  Same 
with the other games listed above.  And that's the problem with these lists:
