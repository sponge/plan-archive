Final testing on the shareware version of Balls of Steel is happening.  Should be
released within 10 days, maybe 5.

I rate Alien Resurrection a 6 (the first two are 10's and the 3rd rates a solid 2).
After seeing Aliens (the second movie) I thought there were two more movies that
needed to be made (as opposed to the two sequels that have been made):  In the first
they capture a Queen, bring her to Earth for study, and all hell breaks loose (a bit
like Alien 4 in which they study the aliens, but I would have done more research on
them and shown that they were highly intelligent and explained their motives, etc.).
In the second (fourth and final overall) we decide that these aliens are simply too
dangerous for the universe and a galactic-wide hunt for their planet ensues.  We find
other planets totally wiped out by them along the way, and even find the home planet
for the huge ship in the first Alien movie (wouldn't you love to see more explanation
on those aliens?).  The message is that anyone that messes with these aliens perishes.
We do find their home world but nuking it won't work because they live underground almost
like ants.  We have to go to their planet and there we see much more of their history and
why they're so tough and adaptable.  In the end, after a massive but failed battle, we
realize we cannot destroy them nor their planet, so we rule that all space within 10
parsecs is off limits, by penalty of death.  Before the closing credits we see a military
craft entering the alien planet atmosphere and the ship's commander is saying to his
military crew, "We can learn from them, they are the ultimate weapon.  All we need is one
to breed..."  Of course, we never learn.

Duke news:  The N64 version of Duke is out.  The Duke Kill-A-Ton Collection is now
hitting stores.  Nuclear Winter, a Duke 3D level pack, should be hitting stores in
a week, and Life's a Beach, the final Duke 3D level pack, will hit stores early Dec.

Got milestone #7 of Max Payne yesterday, which showed a huge leap in progress.  There's
already 12 characters, and plenty of jaw-dropping special effects I haven't seen in other
games.  Remedy Entertainment, the developer, is showing off their demo scene roots.

Nick Shaffner, previously with DigiFX, joined the Duke Nukem Forever team last week as a
lead coder, along with Chris Hargrove.  Prey is still looking for a 3D modeler/animator,
but due to some layoffs at Ion Storm, we might be close to filling that position.

Weekly puzzle:

How quickly can you find what is so unusual about this paragraph?  It looks so ordinary
that you might think nothing was wrong with it at all and, in fact, nothing is.  But it
is unusual. Why?  If you study it, and think about it, you may find out, but I am not
going to assist you in any way. . . you must do it without coaching.  No doubt, if you
work on it long it will dawn on you.  Go to work now and try your skill or luck.  Par
is about half an hour.

(Thanks to Chris Lehr for submitting this puzzle.)

Balls of Steel is basically done, and has been done for weeks, except for a driver
problem that affects about 20% of the machines we tested.  Once we get the fix from
Sci-Tech we'll send the gold master to GTIS, and we'll upload the shareware version.
We've spent the extra time polishing the game even further.

Weekly puzzle:  You have two 10-ounce flasks.  One is 80% filled with blue dye and the
other is equally filled with red dye.  You take one fluid ounce from the red dye flask
and put it into the blue dye flask, stirring as little or as much as you want.  You then
take one fluid ounce from the mostly blue dye flask and put it into the red dye flask.
After you've done this, both flasks are once again 80% full.  The questions is this:  Is
there more blue dye in the original red dye flask, or is there more red dye in the mostly
blue dye flask?  (Hint:  This puzzle is a logic puzzle.)

We're very close to having our 3rd Prey level designer, Martinus, join us.  This is
an interesting hire because he's is from Germany, and we've been working with our
immigration attorney for over five months to bring him into our country.  One of
the big problems is that there's not an official job for level designer within the
Immigration Services' national database, so matters were not as clean-cut as they
could have been.

But all the hurdles have finally been jumped, and I just got done signing a dozen
signatures on a multitude of documents, petitions and forms that will finally clear
the way for Martinus to make the move.  Why go through all the trouble and expense to
hire him?  I'll let Paul answer that one...

Got our stand-up Forgotten Worlds arcade machine yesterday, which is *not* Black Tiger,
as reported in someone else's plan several weeks ago.  ;)  It's a lot tougher than I
remember--took me six continues to beat it today.  It's funny that one of the two
characters in that game looks a lot like Duke, even so far as wearing shades.  This
game pre-dates Duke by nearly four years, so maybe we were subliminally influenced.

*  Why is it that nearly every article I read about a coming 3D first-person shooter
mentions that the game will--gasp!--have an integrated story and plot, as if few or
none of the other coming 3D shooters will?  As far as I can tell, *all* coming 3D
shooters will do a much, much better job at integrating a story.  This is not shocking
news.  It's simply a required evolutionary step for these games to make, and all major
players are taking this step.

*  Half-Life, Daikatana and Unreal have all given up on making this Xmas, which I
think each of these games originally intended to make.  This is a testament that 3D games,
with realistic 3D worlds, are *very* tough to make, and this is compounded at companies
that have never made a 3D shooter before and are overcoming unexpected hurdles.  The
stakes and standards in this genre are so high now that no one can afford to make a bomb
or even an okay-seller, and that, too, adds to the development time.  Personally, I enjoy
the supremely high level of competition in this genre, as it keeps us thinking of new
innovations and new ways to out-smart what everyone else is doing.  At least, that's what
we hope we're doing.  ;)

*  A new puzzle to quench your parched-lip thirst:

You have five short bits of chain, each with three rings linked sequentially (e.g.  ooo ).
(In other words, each of the five chains is three links long.)  The goal is to link all
five pieces into one long piece, that's 15 links long (e.g. ooooooooooooooo ).  It takes
five minutes to break open a link, and five minutes to close a link back together around
another link.  What is the least amount of time it'll take to make the long chain from
the five short chains?

The answer usually appears at www.3dportal.com within a day.

Halloween Day

The Sega port of Duke Nukem 3D scored a 5/5 in one of England's top game mags.
The N64 version has already landed three covers.  Then you have the PlayStation
version coming in about a month and it has received exceptional previews, too.
Looks like Duke is dressing up as Santa this Xmas.  Ho ho ho.  :)

This week's UPDATED puzzle:  You are blindfolded.  You throw two dimes in the air and they
both land, bounce around, and come to rest flat.  A second person, an observer, tells you
that one of the dimes is heads-up (but doesn't tell you which dime).  What are the odds
that the other dime is also heads-up?  (And just to make sure you don't dismiss this
puzzle quickly, the answer is *not* 50%.)  Bonus:  What are the odds that the hidden dime
is tails-up?  (Note:  Thanks to everyone who pointed out my error in wording this puzzle
is a confusing and misleading way, which I've now corrected.)

Like Shadow Warrior or not, I recommend you spend a few minutes reading the first
chapter of the first Shadow Warrior novel, which is online at www.3drealms.com,
visit "Latest Apogee/3D Realms News!", then click on the book cover.  This chapter
is totally cool and hilarious--you will not be disappointed.

Bought Fallout, Lands of Lore and Ultima Online yesterday.  I rarely have time to
finish games I start, but I like to at least check them out to see if there are
any good ideas to use for inspiration (or to steal :).  Total Annihilation
continues to be a total blast.

Can't give any specifics, but there are several prominent developers interested
in licensing our Prey Technology.  We're going to restrict the number of licenses,
plus we're only going to license to companies who are doing games significantly
different to other licensees.  We're not interested in seeing a bunch of Prey clones.

Why the NFL rules over other spectator sports:  Each game actually means something.

Finally, answers to last weeks puzzles can be found at 3D Portal (http://www.3dportal.com/),
under the "October 20th, 1997" news heading.

This week's puzzle is a bit tougher, and one of my favorites:

There's a narrow railroad bridge crossing a deep chasm.  You're walking along it
having made it seven tenths of way so far, when suddenly you hear a train coming.
You know that this train always travels 50 mph, but because the area is mountainous
you're not sure which way the train is coming from.  Instantaneously reacting, you
randomly pick a direction to run and just dive off the bridge as the train roars by
you, almost killing you.  How fast (average speed) where you running to escape death?

Once again, please do not send me your answers or requests for the solution.
3D Portal typically has the solution online within a day or two.

Just got the Nov. issue of PC Gamer (448-packed pages!), which has Duke Nukem on
the cover and a 10-page info-packed spread on Duke Nukem Forever, along with several
sidebars on Prey, Max Payne and other subjects.  Jason Bates wrote this terrific
exclusive.  Folks, this article is all you're going to see about this game for many,
many months, except for maybe a rare screen shot here and there.  I highly recommend
that anyone at all remotely interested in Duke buy this issue.

The article was written before we made the decision to go with 16-bit source art,
which means these screen shots do not look nearly as good as the game currently
looks.  Also, there are a ton of break though ideas we're not mentioning publicly
until the game's release.  Our goal is not to over-expose and over-hype this game.

The article ends with this sentence:  "We're not fortune tellers, but we have every
confidence that Duke Nukem Forever will be the biggest--and perhaps the best--titles
of 1998."  That confidence is *not* misplaced.  ;)

New puzzle:

Let's play Let's Make A Deal!  Monty Hall asks you to pick one of three curtains.
Behind one curtain is a car, behind another is a sofa, and behind another is a goat.
Obviously, all you care about is getting the car.  Let's say you picked curtain #1.
Monty, who knows what's behind each curtain, opens up curtain #2 and reveals the sofa.
Then he turns to you and says, "Tell ya what... I'll let you stay with curtain #1, or
switch to curtain #3."  The question is:  Is it beneficial to switch?

Bonus puzzle:

A car goes one lap around a mile long oval track at 30 mph.  How fast does the car
need to go on a second lap to average 60 mph for both laps?

Once again, please do not send me your answers or requests for answers.  I'm too
busy to respond to everyone.  The answers will be posted here next Friday.  Good luck.  :)

Been watching people around the office play Jedi Knight.  Looks like a fun game
(great sound effects), though I wish the levels had better shadowing effects--the
lack of contrast gives the game a dated look.  However, LucasArts has a giant
advantage in having the Star Wars universe to base games on.  This advantage pretty
much insures that anything they do associated with Star Wars will be a big hit.
Must be nice.  ;)

Also, I'm looking forward to Activision's Battlezone.  The was an arcade favorite
of mine (I could play indefinitely on one quarter, and often played for hours at a
time hunting down those saucers).  The only problem I foresee is in recreating the
original Battlezone controls.  That's the problem with porting arcade hits like
Robotron, Missile Command and Tempest to the PC--without the original custom controls
those games are not nearly as fun to play.

We've got a lot of good feedback on the Shadow Warrior novels.  Unlike the DOOM novels,
which were widely panned, the Shadow Warrior novels encompass an entirely original story,
with ties back to the game.  We'll have the first chapter available on our web site very
soon.  If you liked the Destroyer series, you'll like the Shadow Warrior novels, too.

In stores soon with be the Duke Nukem Kill-
