In the new March issue of Computer Gaming World, columnist Jeff Green (page 235) states his opinion that the Professional Gamers' League (PGL) "is one huge case of wishful thinking," and "The [PGL] is not for you.  Get it out of your head."

Up front, I'll make sure all reading this know I'm a board member for the PGL, but I'm far removed from the daily operation of this organization, and I think I can claim a reasonably unbiased viewpoint.

I hope and believe the PGL will succeed, and if it doesn't I hope something similar succeeds in its place.  I think this industry needs recognized game champions, as it helps to promote the entire industry, it creates more jobs for people wanting in the industry, and it rewards players who excel, as they are rewarded in other sports and skills.

Is game playing a sport?  I can put forth a strong argument that it's as much a sport as billiards, and requires as much intelligence as games like chess and bridge, all three of which have organized national tournaments and sponsors and world champions.

The only difference I can see is that computer games rarely have a life over a year (due to advancing technology), and therefore players must constantly learn new skills, for new games, in order to stay competitive.  This fact alone makes it extremely tough for one player to remain a world champion for more than a few years, and anyone who does remain a top player for longer than a few years has truly proved their talent and versatility.

Why is Jeff Green not a believer in the PGL?  Most likely because it's new and not completely proven, yet.  When things are new, there are always critics and pessimists who don't see a big future.  The CEO of IBM, shortly after IBM's first mainframe was created, said that he saw at most a need for five mainframes worldwide.  Even Bill Gates is known to have said that we'd never need more than 640k of RAM, back when the IBM PC first appeared, about 18 years ago.

I have an optimistic view of the PGL.  I think computer gaming is here to stay, and there needs to be a league for the industry's best players.  More power, money and Ferrari's to them.  :)

Immaturity is its own best punishment.  Enough said about that.

Weekly puzzle:  In Duke Nukem's Las Vegas Casino there's a glass container
with 488,000 dollar bills on display.  This was a fund raiser where for a $5
ticket a person could guess how many dollars the glass box contained, with
the ticket money going to anti-alien concerns.  After the fund raiser, when the
seal was broken and the bills tallied, they counted only $438,000, with
$50,000 missing!  Ms. Croft was in charge of the glass box and originally
enclosing the money.  When Duke questioned her, she said she personally
counted each bill by hand twice, during the three days before the box was
sealed.  Duke then blew her away with his RPG, knowing that she was the box
raider.  How did he know she was the thief?

Although not the right answer, this is surely the funniest
I got so far:  

Having spent plenty of time in Las Vegas, and establishing
a lot of connections, Duke knew [Ms. Croft] took the $50,000 when
he took a look at her new redesigned, resurfaced and apparently
now round mammaries.  Figuring it cost her that much to fix those
pointy dominatrix things she had going on in her last adventure,
Duke put the poor little vain thing out of her misery with one RPG
on her breastplate of righteousness.  The next Duke level was then
called "Silicon Meltdown". -- from MoonDragon

A local developer who previously worked here (and is now at another
job) had this to say in a recent interview on a fan web site:

"[A]s many development teams are figuring out, there's really
no need for a middle man like 3D Realms anymore.  It's the
publisher that's doing the marketing and distribution and the
talent that's making the game.  3D Realms supplies office space
and computers and some small benefits at a cost of more than
half of the royalties from the game, but that stuff isn't so
expensive as to make independent development prohibitive."

What a dumbass thing to say!

Does this mean that any developer with more than one team is
a so-called "middle man"?  Does this mean that ION Storm,
Ensemble Studios, Epic MegaGames, Terminal Reality, Parallax
Software, Ritual Entertainment, Firaxis, Digital Anvil,
Lionhead, Raven and a dozen other development companies with more
than one internal team are middle men?!

Get a friggin' clue!  3D Realms *is* a developer.  Duhhh!  And
in fact, we do more than most developers because we also have a
significant direct order business (a business we pioneered), via
shareware marketing, that most other developers do not have--and
this business generates even more royalties for developers that
work here that otherwise would not be had by them.

It's been a while since I needed to rant, but this remark was
simply too ignorant to let pass.

We got in 50 Duke porcelain statues yesterday for the crew.
Only 8500 of these are being made, all numbered, and Moore
Creations expects them to sell out.  This is the kind of
collector's item that in 25+ years will likely be very
valuable as Duke's popularity continues to grow.  And with
the movie deal making big strides (we've signed a big-name
producer) there's a good chance that this statue could be
sold out quickly and worth substantially more than the selling
price within a few years.  Don't you wish you would have
bought the original Star Trek or Star Wars collectors items?  ;)
Now's your chance to get in while the gettin' in is still cheap.
You can reach Moore Creations at (817) 568-2620.

Now using the cordless (radio frequency) Logitech mouse.  The
shape takes a bit of getting used to, but once that hurdle is
jumped it's much easier to use than a wired mouse.  It's just
as responsive, but the lack of cord gives it a big edge.  It has
a side button for the thumb that can be programmed to any of 20+
functions, such as auto-double-clicking.  I use it to control the
up/down scroll bar, which makes it more convenient than the wheel
on the new Microsoft mouse.

With all the news surrounding Clinton and his affairs, his
nickname, Slick Willy, takes on a new meaning.

Not a difficult puzzle, but a good starter after the long break:
What is at the beginning of eternity, the end of time, the
beginning of every end, and the end of every place?

Finally got the new finger system in place.  Puzzles will resume this Friday.

www.GameSpot.com has been running a reader's most anticipated game poll,
pitting the following games against each other:  Diakatana, Unreal, SiN,
Half-Life, Prey and Duke Nukem Forever.  The latter three games won their
rounds against the former three, and are now facing off against each other.
Last I checked, with over 175,000 votes in, Prey was winning with 82%, Duke
second with 17%, and Half-Life had the final 1%.  I think Duke is so low
because we haven't promoted it much, yet.  After E3, that will change.

We're putting together the "bible" for Duke Nukem now, also known as a style
guide.  This document reveals everything there is to know about the Duke
character, his background, defining traits, pictures and poses, things he'd
say and not say, other key characters in his universe, like Bombshell and
Proton, and anything else pertinent.  This will be used for the upcoming novels,
comics and potential movie.

We have specific intentions with the Duke movie, and our plan is to make sure
it's cool.  For example, we will make sure Duke doesn't
