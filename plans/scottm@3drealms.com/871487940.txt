I am stunned!

I've never seen so much positive response of an issue--over 1000 messages,
all supportive except for one.  For those who don't know what's going on,
visit www.3drealms.com and read the top news item, regarding the patent
issue.

The full patent and letter that Apogee received has been scanned in and can
be viewed at:  http://www.nconnect.net/~tookycat/apogee/ 

If you care to voice your opinion to this attorney, Ernest Kettelson's law
office numbers are:

Phone:  815-467-1400
Fax:  815-467-1461

Obviously, this patent was one that should not have been granted because
it's so obvious in nature, and too broad.  The Software Publishers
Association (SPA) has been following this patent and has a report on
their site, at:

http://www.spa.org/gvmnt/wash1_8.htm#anchor1744787

I've heard from a dozen patent attorneys who've stated that it's their
opinion that this patent cannot hold up in court.  Here's the message from
one such attorney:

----- message begins -----

Saw your plan update.  BTW, I'm the author of the Quake editor BSP, so I
follow this community.  I'm also a patent attorney, so I was interested
in what Kettelson's client was trying to do.  I don't think I met with
you at e3, though I did meet a bunch of people in the community.

Anyway, I looked at the patent ('635) in question.  The claims (all 2
(not impressive) of them) look narrow in scope.  Don't believe the hype
in the letter.  Have your patent attorney pull the file history on this
patent and see what concessions the inventor had to make to get the
patent and what prior art was cited to the office.  The inventor may
have shot himself in the foot.  Has '635 been asserted against others? 
Any successes (previous litigation of the patent will show up in the
patent's file history, too).  Has the patent ever been reexamined?

To infringe, you would have to be doing each and every thing in one of
_the claims_.  Their spin on the claims is not relevant.  I would doubt
that you are doing _every_ thing in those claims.  If you are not doing
even a single "element" or "limitation" of the claim in question, you do
not infringe.  Those claims have a _lot_ of words (i.e., probably a
narrow patent).

Anyway, you probably knew that.  I think you guys will get past this one
pretty readily.

Between you and me, and I certainly haven't done any research and don't
know the facts, the patent seems bogus and its assertion makes us patent
attorneys look pretty low.  I can understand why the gaming community is
somewhat anti-patent... when this kind of stuff occurs.

----- message ends -----

The press has jumped on this story and nearly every major web site has
covered it, with more to come, including print magazines.  I'm hoping the
the patent owner (Craig Enokian of Illinois) and his attorney, feel the
heat from both the press and game players, and back off this scam.  I'll
post more news as I get it.

Next Generation magazine (August issue, page 95) has a preview of Ritual's
SiN in which is stated:  "Hipnotic...employees include Duke Nukem 3D's head
level designer..." (referring to Richard "Levelord" Grey, a previous
developer at 3D Realms now at Ritual--formally Hipnotic).

A small correction needs to be made:  Richard Grey, as fine a mapper as
there is, was never the "head level designer" on Duke Nukem 3D.  Allen Blum,
who was a level designer on the first two Duke Nukem games, was the *head
mapper* on Duke Nukem 3D (and is the head mapper and asst. producer on Duke
Nukem Forever, too).  Richard was brought in halfway through Duke 3D's
development to assist Allen and get the game done faster.

Richard himself said, in a level design article for PC Games (Sept. 1996
issue, pg. 50), "A special thanks to Allen Blum for letting me do my thing
in his sandbox; he is a god among us lowly lords."

Next Generation's SiN article continues, referring to Ritual's Quake
Mission Pack No. 1 as "Hipnotic's first post-Duke effort."  How can
anything they do be considered a "post-Duke effort" if none of them but
one (Richard) was a core member of the Duke 3D team?

Looks like Next Generation did a sinful job on getting their facts straight
on this story.  ;)

I'm trying to avoid hyping Prey too much in my plan, but
PC Gamer (US version) just arrived and said many glowing
things about Prey that I want to repeat.

Jason Bates, news editor for PC Gamer, who said in his
column several issues ago that Prey was greatly hurt by
certain developer departures, had this to say in the
current issue after seeing the game at E3:  "Prey...was
a huge surprise, catching me completely off guard...anyone
who saw the portal technology and the rest of the engine
in action could make the case that this was the show
stealer."

Elsewhere in the issue:  "Easily one of the top three games
at E3, it would be a shoe-in for game of the show if the
gameplay was actually in place."

Lastly, in a separate large feature on Prey, PC Gamer wrote:
"After a stellar performance at E3, Prey--once considered a
big question mark on the 3D Realms product schedule--has
become not only 3D Realms' star attraction but a signpost
for 3D games in 1998.  Prey is a technological tour de force,
beyond both Quake and Unreal; in plain English, this game
rocks."

Max Payne, first unveiled at E3, also had strong praise:
"Another impressive title is Max Payne...it looks like this
game will be one of the top tier in terms of technology in
the upcoming year."

PC Gamer mentioned that there was no sign of
Duke Nukem Forever ("...not even a screen shot...") at
E3.  That's because it's our intention to keep news on this
game at a minimum until it's much, much closer to release.
However, the November issue of PC Gamer will have
a nice cover story on Duke 4, and this will likely be
the only significant Duke 4 press coverage until
several months into 1998.

In other news, Johnny Wilson, top dog Editor-in-Chief of
Computer Gaming World, will be here in just a few minutes
to have a look at Prey.  He's heard so many great things
about it (he missed it at E3) that he is flying down for a
personal gander and a lunch stop at On the Border.

It's almost unavoidable that when a large publicly traded corporation
buys a small, focused company that the small company loses its identity,
passion, and many of their key people who don't want to work under the new
rules, system, culture or bureaucracy.

It's worth noting that there are few independent development houses left
that can truly guide their own destiny and create games without corporate
pressures and budgets.  The following list of once independent development
groups is now under a corporate umbrella that in part or in whole dictates
budgets, release dates and game content:

Core Design -- Eidos
Dynamix -- Sierra
Papyrus -- Sierra
Bullfrog -- EA
Origin -- EA
Maxis -- EA
Shiny -- Interplay
Blizzard -- CUC
Raven -- Activision
...and many, many others.

Apogee has been courted by several much bigger publishers (including
Sierra), but we're turned down all offers, and we have no intention on
losing the total freedom we now have.

I hope that the few independent developers that are left plan to stay that
way.  I know we will.

Hey, Epic and id are both stealing their character ideas from
Rise of the Triad damn it!  We had male and female characters way
back in 1994.  ;)  :)

The fact is that *all* developers copy good ideas from other games,
both intentionally and unintentionally.  If you're a developer that
talks about your game's key ideas on the net, then you'd better expect
that other developers will see these ideas and consider using the
good ones--we certainly do (see good ideas and use them, if appropriate).

It's unfortunate for Epic and the Unreal team that their game has taken
so long to come out.  This has dwindled it's technology advantage, and is
obviously causing some misplaced ill-feelings toward competing developers.

It's also an unfortunate coincidence that Quake 2 has similar characters
to those in Unreal.  I'm sure id didn't do this on purpose and probably
had no idea that Unreal had the very same characters (bald male and
female with ponytail).

In any case, to whoever gets their game out first will go the spoils.
That's survival of the fittest, and the way it should be.

What's wrong with AOL?  Here's one big problem:  They're running off
their top content providers in the gaming industry.  We're the latest to
receive a "Termination of Interactive Services Agreement" letter.  They're
closing down our AOL forum August 1st.  Sure, they'll let us keep it running,
but only if we agree to pay them $55,000 a year!  Yes, we get to pay AOL to
provide them content and make their service more valuable to their customers.
That's clever of them.  The result is that we're outta there, along with
several other top content providers, developers and publishers in our industry.
AOL is outsmarting themselves into oblivion.  The web is going to kill AOL
soon enough, but I guess they prefer to put a gun to their own head and get
it over with sooner rather than later.

(Note:  The following was edited due to it being perceived as too
inflammatory, which was not the intention.)

Just read on GameSpot (www.gamespot.com/previews/quake2/index.html) a
Quake 2 preview that contains scathing comments against John Romero by
members of id Software.  Id claims to be much, much better off with all
of their departures, saying they have a lean, more dedicated, better
focused team.  (Id's CEO also speaks on this subject on Inside Games at
http://www.actionworld.com/insidegames/.)

We've had a lot of turnover lately, too, and this has allowed us to
significantly improve the talent level within our company by hiring better
new people.  New people tend to be much more passionate and dedicated, plus
our ability to hire cream-of-the-crop talent continually improves, as well
as the talent level of developers who apply for positions here (thanks to
our continually improving reputation in the industry).

So I can see why id makes the comments they do about people leaving their
company, and their company being better off because of it.  We've
experienced the same phenomenon.

* I just want to reinforce what Jay "Shade" Wilson has written in his plan file
about the fact that Blood is not a 3D Realms game (which has been incorrectly
reported by a few press sources, such as CGW).  Blood was originally going to
be released by 3D Realms as shareware, with FormGen (remember them!) having
the retail rights.  At the time of the deal's inception, in 1994, Blood was being
developed by Q Studios, headed by Nick Newhard.

Over the course of the game's development, GT Interactive bought FormGen,
thus acquiring the game's retail distribution rights (actually, it wasn't this
straight forward, but the end result is the same), and Q Studios was acquired
by Monolith Productions.  3D Realms (knee deep in Duke ports, Shadow Warrior
development and Prey development) and Monolith both agreed it'd be better for
Blood's success to change the deal and remove 3D Realms out of the creative
loop.  This allowed them to focus totally on Blood, and allowed us to focus more
on the stuff we had going.  Basically, the deal became a simple Build engine
licensing deal for Monolith.  (This is much like what happened with Ruins,
another Build engine game, by Lobotomy Software, which became strictly a
Lobotomy game and a Build engine license arrangement.)

We've learned here that you shouldn't try to be involved with too many games at
a time because you'll lose focus and end up not doing anything really well.  That's
a big reason why we separated from both the Ruins and the Blood projects, and in
the end Blood was a better game because it allowed both companies to really
focus without distractions from the other company.

* Prey got a full paragraph in the New York Times today, along with
about 10 other games (from the 1500 at E3).  Just more praise heaped
onto the project and its next-generation Portal Technology.  Also,
The Adrenaline Vault has given me a preview of their coming Prey
write up, which I won't spoil for anyone, but it's basically
saying that Prey will redefine the 3D shooter market when it arrives.

* Looks like a Duke toy action figure is coming out for Xmas.
We're meeting with the manufacturer next week to review what
they've done so far (which is very cool--their whole positioning
is based on *quality*, and they did the Lost World action line).
We're also going to have them help us design some very unusual
characters for Duke Nukem Forever, both for the game and more
action figure toys.

* PC Magazine has a list of the top 100 influential computer
companies of all time.  I wrote to them stating that it wa
