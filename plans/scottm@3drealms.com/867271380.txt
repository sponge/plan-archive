Note:  I corrected a mistake below.  The great preview on Max
Payne, or newly revealed story-based 3rd-person 3D action game,
is on www.gameslice.com in their E3 coverage section.

* Another cool Prey preview just appeared on Online Gaming
Review.  Check it out at www.ogr.com/previews/prey.shtml.  Looks
like they awarded Prey "Best of E3 Show."  Cool.

* Also, we just posted a Prey update on our web page.  Go to our
games section and you'll be able to track it down from there.
Two new screen shots have been posted, too.  The full color
spectrum shot does not use MMX, nor is it a feature of the 3Dfx
card--it's made possible through our own code and our radiosity
engine.

* A long list of major magazines are doing big articles on Prey
and even talking several covers.  We're stoked.

* Today heard that one of our recent x-developers told one of our
current developers at E3 that "Prey looks like a turd."  I think
that comment speaks for itself.

* About to go play disc golf and a big storm is moving in. Bummer.

All-time Stupid Game Ad Award:  In Edge magazine (July), a
game titled Detonator Orgun (in big type at the top of the ad)
has a picture of a space warrior guy standing in the middle
portion of the ad, and at the bottom in large print says:
"The Battle for Earth is About to Begin..."

Wow.  Now there's a concept we haven't seen before!  If this
is the best selling point for this game it's a sure loser.

The game is by Manga Video.

June 23, 1997 -- E3 Wrap-up

* First, flying is hell.  The flight to E3 was delayed two
hours.  That sucked.  But it was nothing like the flight back
in which we were stranded in the plane on the taxi way for
nearly two hours in the heat of day while a huge storm
closed down our destination airport in Dallas.  Everyone
on the plane was soaked in sweat--it was at least 95 degrees
in that oven--including this poor family with a baby who
spent half its time crying.  After two hours of baking
(and nothing to drink!) the pilot tells us that it's going
to be at least another hour before take-off and that we're
going back to the gate and connect up to an off-plane air
conditioning unit.  Thank God, I thought, there is hope I
might live through this.  Another hour later--still nothing
to drink!--and we finally get the go-ahead and move into
the 40 minute long line of planes waiting to take-off, time
spent without the benefit of cool air.  Why don't these planes
have air conditioning when they're on the ground!?  There should
should be a law against this.  (BTW, all the while the folks in
first class *were* getting drinks.  Grrrrr.)

Okay, we're finally in the air and everything seems cool
(literally).  We've spent well over three hours on the ground
for a flight that's only suppose to take two hours!  But NO,
it's not over.  The weather god has one last screw to twist into
us:  As we near Dallas the pilot says the weather has gone bad
again and we go into a holding pattern for an hour before we
finally get to land.  In total we spend seven hours on the plane
(half of the time without air conditioning) for a two
hour flight, getting one coke and two bags of pretzels.  Joy.

Okay, on to the good stuff...

* I love E3.  It again ended a day or two too soon for me.  I
didn't get to see the entire floor and there were many games I
missed altogether, or didn't get to spend enough time reviewing.
I also didn't get enough time to visit with as many developer
friends as I usually do.  I did, though, meet quite a few of
the new breed of Internet personalities, such as Lithium, OneThumb,
Redwood, sCary, RonSolo, and so on.  I love what these guys are
doing and appreciate fully their high value to the game industry.
In fact, these guys are probably more important than the press
in some ways because of the we're-part-of-the-public everyman
status they have, making their views seem less biased.

* As I said in my last plan, www.e3news.com had perhaps the best
on-line coverage (ZD-NET came close).  Check it out and do a
search for Prey to read two good articles on the subject.

* Prey.  The response to this game was far beyond anything we
could have predicted.  Every reporter to a man (and a few women)
said it was the most amazing technology at the show.  GameCenter
wrote "Prey blew our minds...it would seem 3D Realms currently
has the advantage."  And Gamespot wrote "The graphics are so
convincing and so fluid that they don't beg comparison to existing
games like Quake, but instead to reality itself.  We realize that
may sound ridiculous, but it's true."  Across the board, the press
were all dramatically floored by our behind-closed-doors
presentation, where we showed all the good stuff we kept from the
on-the-floor, non-interactive demo.  It was funny to see at least
four other development companies video taping the floor demo, with
some of them trying to hide their badges so as not to be recognized.

* The news is out about Max Payne, being developed by Remedy
Entertainment (based in Finland--the team who created Death Rally).
Visit www.gameslice.com for a long preview of this game, including
screen shots.  We have set our sights sky high with this project
and expect it to be a genre creator.  This game is not signed with
a publisher yet, so until that happens we're not going to be saying
too much about it.

* Duke Nukem Forever didn't make a showing.  First, it's still at
a stage where a lot of critical decisions are being made about it,
and second we didn't want to let the competition see many of the
incredible new innovations we already have in place.  With Duke,
we don't need to build up the hype--it's already there.  So we can
afford to keep the game in our back pocket during this stage of
its development.  I expect by Xmas we'll crank the Duke hype into
high gear, but until that time news will be slow.  Above all we don't
want Duke to be grouped into the current confusion of Quake-engine
games, so we'll let these other games battle it out for several
more months.

* Cool E3 stuff:

o Metal Gear Solid (PSX) -- Stupid name.  The best looking 3D,
third-person action game I saw.  Man I can't wait to play this
game (and learn from it).

o Dungeon Keeper -- Yikes, this looks good!  Peter Molyneux is
one of the industries' stars, perhaps the best pure game
designer in the business.  Unlike some other stars, he's expertly
designed games in multiple genres, and invented multiple genres.
It's doesn't get any more impressive than that.  I love what he
said in a recent Edge interview when asked about the secret to
game design:  "I'm not clever, I'm not brilliant--I'm boring,
actually...All I do is take an idea and just play it a million,
million times...you just play it and if at the end of it you're not
bored with the game, then you know it's right."  Amen.  This is what
we believe here, too, and it's the reason why we never know when our
games will be done until they're done.  Any game with a solid release
date that's more than four months away is a game being designed by
someone with a different philosophy, and that's not a good thing.

o The GT Interactive booth was cool, with huge statues of Duke,
Lo Wang, and an Unreal creature.  Also, GT put together a demo tape
continuously running on monitors and one segment had the song Shaft
with Duke lyrics.  Very funny.  We'll try to make this publicly
available.  Also, the free food (cookies galore, sandwiches, sodas)
at the GT booth was great.

o It was cool to see that Scavenger was gone for good.  Everything
I've heard about the way they mistreated developers is shocking.
Two of the Into the Shadows programmers, btw, are on the Max Payne
projects.  :)

* Uncool E3 stuff:  LucasArts' invitation-only booth.

* The 3D gaming scene is definitely improving.  The current round
of 3D shooters is far more promising than we've seen in the past.
It looks like most of these games are trying to copy the
interactivity of Duke 3D and Shadow Warrior, which is good.  Also,
puzzles are getting better and better, avoiding the tired key/door
method.

* I don't see how it's possible for Daikatana nor Unreal to make
this year, which they're both promising.

* Back-scratching:  A new game magazine was debuted at the show,
Computer Game Entertainment, that looks pretty good.  My main reason
for mentioning it is because they gave Duke 3D their "Best Action
Game of 1996" award, beating runner-ups Quake and Tomb Raider.
(BTW, Diablo got their "Game of the Year" award.)

Well, got real work to do.  I'll have more E3 thoughts next time...

========================================
June 17, 1997

Late at night, getting ready to go to E3 tomorrow...

This is easily my favorite trip of the year, more exciting
than even a snow skiing vacation.

* This year will be the first year without the stunning and
stunningly expensive Scavenger booth.  Too bad this flash in
the pan didn't spend as much money on "its" games.  ;)
* Last year there were at least a dozen highly hyped 3D FP
shooters, and all looked pretty good.  I expect to see the
same thing this year.  And next year, and the year after...
* I've read there are going to be over 50 real-time strategy
games on display.  I predict only these two (other than those
released by Westwood and Blizzard) will be successful:  Dark
Riegn and Total Annihilation.  The rest will be also-rans that
don't offer anything new enough to be a hit.
* I predict there will not be a surprise game this year that
catches everyone by surprise by its freshness and innovation.
Although I hope I'm wrong.
* I'm really looking forward to meeting many of my developer
friends.  This is such a competitive, keeps-us-all-busy
industry (rarely working less than a 70 hour week) that social
events are few are far between.
* Strangely for me, I'm looking forward to checking out Sierra's
Mask of Eternity.  Sierra hasn't done anything for me since
Space Quest III, but I think this game shows break-thru promise.
* Finally, I predict Prey will be one of the top 5 hits of the show.  :)
If you're gonna be there, check out the GT Interactive booth.

========================================
June 16, 1997

* www.e3news.com looks to be one of the best web sites for
monitoring the happenings at E3.  This is a Gamespot/ZD-Net
run site with 40+ writers at the show.  A few of the editors
visited us last week for preview info on Prey, which should
be posted within a day or two.

* Balls of Steel, our coming pinball game (under our
Pinball Wizards label), is coming along rapidly now that
the conversion to Win95 is complete.  A big hurdle that
had to be overcome by the developers (Wildfire Studios,
in Australia) was that DirectsuX doesn't support hardware
scrolling, which is essential in this game for 70FPS
smoothness of the 800x600 scrolling table.  We had to turn
to SciTech's UniVBe Ultra linkable drivers, which added
about $8000 more to the project's cost.  (That's about 1000
more games we need to sell before we start making a profit.)

* Noticed in the just-out issue of PC Games magazine that
they're holding a "Duke Nukem Forever Storyline" contest.
They write:  "If you consider yourself an imaginative
individual, go on and tap into that creative energy and
submit your version of the plotline of Duke Forever."
They're offering an autographed copy of Duke 3D to the
best submission.

My first reaction to this is that PC Games is assuming our
story will be as lame as previous 3D action games.  The fact
is, though, is that most of the future 3D action games will
be much better thought-out, and with a much better integrated
story.  This is the natural evolution for these games now
that we're past the initial boom period for this genre.

Also, many people do not give enough credit to the story
in Duke 3D.  This was the first of these games that had
a decent integrated story, a developed character (rather
than a faceless, who cares character) and levels that for
the most part linked in a logical progression.  Sure, the
save Earth and its chicks story isn't going to win awards,
but it fit the comic book style world in which Duke lives.
It was meant to be campy.

* Romy and Michelle's Highschool Reunion:  Damn funny.

========================================
June 13, 1997 (my birthday!)

* Go get 'em guys.  Loved the Open Letter to Microsloth,
stating that MS needs to further support OpenGL for game
developers as well as they support DirectsuX.  (Golly, can
I be any more mean to MS?  I shouldn't be--they're really
good guys, just misdirected sometimes.)  The signatures on
this letter read like a Who's Who of the members of GameTech,
so these are truly the best people to get MS to change their
ways.

The only problem with this letter is that it should have
listed company names, too, because most people have never
heard of these developers (or at least most of them).  This
letter would have had much better impact with companies
like 3D Realms, Raven, id, Epic, Parallax, LucasArts, etc.
behind it and listed on it.

* Yesterday Apogee was part of a star-studded group of
initial inductees in the newly established Shareware Hall of
Fame, foun
