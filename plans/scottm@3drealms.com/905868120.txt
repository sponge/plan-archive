Last week I went to ECTS in London, and then to Finland for a few days to visit Remedy 
(developers of Max Payne).

ECTS is a mini-E3, catering to the European game industry.  It's a worthwhile show because many 
of the attendees don't make the long trip to E3 and this is their chance to see all the coming 
games, hardware and meet people face-to-face.

Max Payne was the only game 3D Realms was showing at the show (no Duke or Prey), which was 
being demo'ed in the Take 2 booth, in a backroom area reserved for Gathering of Developer games.  
(Take 2 is the exclusive distributor of Gathering games in Europe.)  Remedy's Petri Jarvilehto 
(project leader) and Sam Lake (lead designer, story architect) showed the game for three solid 
days to impressed crowds.  I've heard through solid sources that Max earned at least two Game of 
Show honors from major industry publications (yet to be publicly announced).

The other three Gathering games on display (TRI's Nocturne and FLY!, Pop Top's Railroad Tycoon 
2) also made strong showings.  Other mighty impressive games I saw at the show were 
Anachronox, Outcast, King Pin, Super Bikes and Zelda.

Went to see a very cool movie in London one night, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels," (a 
low-budget English film that's as good as Pulp Fiction) and who's buying a ticket right beside me!?  
Bond... James Bond, a.k.a Sean Connery.  And he's seeing the same movie!  Too cool!  The movie 
mentions "James Bond" and I turned around to see Sean chuckling with his female friend (maybe 
his wife, don't know).  And no, none of us seeing the movie rudely asked for his autograph.

After ECTS I flew to Finland with the Remedy crew, staying in Helsinki.  I can't do justice to 
Finland's beauty, which I've heard it's comparable to northern Canada.  There are hundreds of 
lakes all surrounded by green forest on rolling hills of rosy granite.  Most family's in Finland have a 
computer, and *everyone* carries a cell phone--A Nokia phone, of course, since Nokia is a Finnish 
company.  Unlike the USA, which is just now going digital, Finland went digital half a decade ago.  
The just-out new Nokia phone is ultra small, all chrome, and doesn't have an antenna (its case it 
the antenna).  I tried to buy one but unfortunately it won't work in the States.  Damn.  I did buy a 
bulging sack of Finnish candy, though.  : )

We spent two days of solid meetings on every facet of Max Payne.  These discussions were so 
productive I'm returning in February to do it again.  Also did the Finnish sauna routine, 20 minutes 
of 216 degree skin melting torture followed by a dive into icy cold lake water, the latter which I 
refused to do!

Finally, I got to meet Peter Molyneux (founder of Bullfrog), the PC game designer I respect most, 
and spent copious time with Mark Rein of Epic Megagames, who is still full of ideas designed to rule 
the gaming world.  Also got to hang out with several other designers I respect, like Justin Chin and 
Dave Jones (head of DMA Design).  Overall, a terrific trip.

*  The premier issue of PC Accelerator says that Duke Nukem 3D is the greatest manly game of 
all-time.  Wait until they see Duke Nukem Forever!

*  I'm currently helping an author of one of the top gaming web sites write an article on 
shareware, how it started, who the early players were, and where it's going.  Part of this will 
include several tidbits about Apogee's early relationship with id, including the letter I original wrote 
to John Romero (in 1990) in which he thought I was some psycho fan.  Luckily, I kept good 
records from the "old days" and can quote directly from his letter.

*  Most people know about the Duke Nukem movie we're involved with.  As Obi Wan said, "There is 
another..."  Can't go into details yet.  This is why we make character-based games.  I wonder why 
most other developers don't do the same.

*  Duke Nukem movie made a big leap yesterday.  The most recent story draft is finally something 
that represents what we've been looking for.  We (Threshold and 3D Realms) have been molding 
and rewriting this thing for six months, but now we have a concept that excites us, and therefore 
we think will excite Duke fans.  Can't talk about details this early--sorry for the tease.  ; )

*  In the Sept. issue of Game Developer magazine (www.gdmag.com) Warren Spector writes a 
guest column ("Soapbox") that's hits on about a dozen design points that every game developer 
should know before heading into the dangerous world of game design.  For example, a big game 
world is not necessarily an interesting game world.  And conversational branching into a deep tree 
is rarely fun (most game players end up trying every single branch anyway, just to make sure they 
haven't missed anything, and this ends up being very tedious).  After reading this piece, I have 
heightened enthusiasm for Warren's coming game, Dues Ex.  I recommend all developers give this a 
read.

Sequels:  The Lame Name Game

Advice to publishers and developers of sequels:  Stop using the ultimate lame
name device:  sequel numbers.

3D Realms will never have a game title like Duke Nukem 4, Max Payne 2 or Prey
2.  We think those "sequel numbers" that follow a game's title are both
uncreative and lame.  Many movie sequels have equally lame titles, like the
Lethal Weapon sequels, the Godfather sequels and the Rocky sequels.

As an alternative, look at movie sequels that avoid using the lameness of
sequel numbers.  The Star Wars sequels, thank George, are not named Star Wars 2
and Star Wars 3.  Same with the Indiana Jones sequels, each having its own
original name, making each movie seem more like an episode in a TV series. 
George Lucas has figured out the sequel name game.

The Batman sequels, the Alien sequels, and the James Bond series also rely on
each movie having its own unique name, rather than simply attaching a lame
sequel number.  But some sequels try to have it both ways, going with a sequel
number and a new subtitle, like Speed 2:  Cruise Control, but this doesn't
work--the lameness of the sequel number is still there, plus the name is way
too long.  Why not just name the movie Cruise Control and lose the Speed
reference?   (E.g.  The sequel to Jurassic Park wasn't Jurassic Park 2: The
Lost World, it was simply The Lost World.  Lameness avoided!)

From a marketing standpoint, sequel numbers seem like a good idea, because they
build upon the awareness and equity built into the original title, but in the
long run they are detrimental because they look like rehashes of the original
product, rather than stand alone original works on their own.

Tomb Raider 2 and Tomb Raider 3 are both extremely lame titles.  If Eidos had
as much guts as their star character they'd have instead followed the Indiana
Jones model for their game titles:  Raiders of the Lost Ark is equivalent to
the first Tomb Raider title, in that in neither one is the starring character's
name used.  But in the next two movies Lucas wisely emphasized Harrison Ford's
character in the titles (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana
Jones and the Final Crusade).  The second and third Lara Croft games should
have followed this same model, with names like Lara Croft and the Lost City (or
whatever is appropriate to the each game's story).

The continued use of the Tomb Raider name in the sequels is lame in another
respect, too, because it forces each game to take place in a tomb location
every game, otherwise the title doesn't make sense.  Eidos is really missing
the boat by not emphasizing the Lara Croft character in their game titles, and
freeing up the versatility of the game's locations.

At 3D Realms, we don't even view games as sequels, we think of them as new
episodes in an on-going TV series.  Who thinks of each TV episode as a sequel
to the previous episode?  No one.  We apply the same thinking to our games and
our game titles, and so you'll never see a game named Duke Nukem 4, just like
an episode of X-Files isn't titled X-Files 117.

Here are more lame examples of sequel numbered games:

Warlords III:  Darklords Rising -- Why not simply Darklords Rising?

Blood 2:  The Chosen -- Why not just The Chosen?  Is connecting this game to
Blood really that beneficial!?  Look at DreamWorks' game, Trespasser, which
thankfully avoided the lame alternative, The Lost World: Trespasser--someone
had the smarts to realize they didn't need to blatantly attach "The Lost World"
brand to this game's title.

Might and Magic VI:  The Mandate of Heaven -- Why not just The Mandate of
Heaven and somewhere on the box have a Might and Magic logo, like James Bond
has the 007 logo?

Jazz Jackrabbit 2 -- I would have gone with the title Jazz and Spaz instead,
since both characters are emphasized heavily in this game and on the box front.

KKND2:  Krossfire -- Why not just Krossfire?  And if that's trademarked
already, then think of something else as klever.

Need for Speed III:  Hot Pursuit -- Should just be Hot Pursuit with a Need for
Speed logo somewhere on the box front.

Descent:  Freespace:  The Great War -- No sequel number, but this name is just
out of control!  And why it's attached to the Descent series I can't figure
out, what are we descending into?

To be fair, Apogee has had one lame sequel name, Duke Nukem 2 in 1993, but
since that time we got a clue.  Better late than never.

A few people have reminded me that many months ago I said that I'd write about
the negative effects that realistic and improved graphics have had on the game
industry.  I guess it's time to pontificate.  Who knows, I might even have a
valid point or two--sometimes I get lucky that way.

Let's get this straight:  Everyone loves the improved graphics we're seeing in
today's games.  The key problem is that too often developers focus on graphics
and lose focus gameplay issues.

This is why most FMV (full motion video) games fell flat on their pompous
faces.  This is why the convergence of Hollywood and Silicon Valley won't
revolutionize the game industry.  This is why Rocket Science never had a
chance.

Spin the date dial back to the late 70's and early 80's, when graphics were
1-bit, we're talking black and white, but included masterworks like Asteroids,
Space Invaders, Space War, Battlezone, and Pong.  Other 1-bit games used
colored plastic overlays on the monitor itself, like Star Castle, Armor
Attack, and Warlords, and on some machines those overlays even lined up
correctly.

But you know what, as unrealistic as those graphics were, those games were
addictively fun.  Later games like Pac Man, Galaxian, Missile Command,
Tempest, Defender, and Centipede graduated to 2-bit (4 color), and even 4-bit
(16 color) graphics.  But still, the graphics weren't the selling point--it
was still the balanced, polished gameplay.  Designers back then for the most
part designed their games with gameplay in mind first, and the graphics were
simply a medium to bring their game to life.  Look how these older games have
been fondly remembered over the years.  There's a single, solid reason for
that:  Gameplay.

Nowadays, with graphics standards escalating on nearly a monthly basis, it's
tough for developers to focus long and hard on the juicy meat of game design. 
Imagine what the game chess might be like if the game designers had focused
too much attention on the quality of the wooden or stone pieces, and the
detail and shape of the pieces (polygon count?).  I can't imagine that these
were important considerations when the game of chess evolved, meaning chess'
gameplay (game rules and the interaction of the pieces) mattered most and
could be polished without competing distractions.

However, game players like to see something that looks better than they've
seen before.  That's what puts the pressure on developers to focus on better
graphics, and that deducts time from gameplay balance and polishing.

Perhaps the real enemy of gameplay is advancing technology, such as faster
CPUs and new 3D accelerated cards.  If we could freeze hardware technology for
five years, then all developers could stop competing so hard on the graphics
front and once again give due attention to gameplay concerns.  We might even
have more time to think of a few more original games, since we wouldn't have
the crutch of just doing what's been done before but with a better graphics
engine.

I think gameplay is the victim of advancing technology, which favors
advancements in graphics over advancements in game design.  It's a rare
development team that can overcome the seduction of advancing technology and
give gameplay issues proper focus.  Every developers' first step in this
direction is to be aware of the problem...

Geoff Keighley, editor of GameSlice, wrote an interesting article on shareware
games today:

http://www.gameslice.com/editorial/0622share.shtml

In it, he asks  "Why arent there any new shareware companies or any exciting
new shareware games being released?"

Having been involved in the shareware industry since 1986, often in key ways,
I think I can answer this question.

Nowadays, it more often than not takes 10 to 20 person teams to make
competit
