========================================
May 2, 1997

Yesterday everyone from Rogue Entertainment dropped by
to chat, which was a nice surprise.  Rogue, as many of
you know, came in to being after Scott Host left the
team.  When Scott Host was there they called themselves
Cygnus Studios, and were responsible for the popular
scrolling shooter, Raptor.

Rogue went on to make Strife, using the DOOM engine,
and they released released The Quake Mission #2
through Activision.  Now they're working on a full
blown Quake engine game.

George and I spoke with them on Quake stuff for a
while then we showed them a Prey demo and a few of
the levels from Shadow Warrior.

We'll probably make a visit to Rogue soon after
Shadow Warrior is wrapped up.

I want to thank Rogue for bringing us a copy of
their Quake pack and an oversized and very cool
version of the box.  Maybe we can get GTIS to
make something this cool for our future games.

I wish Rogue the best of luck and success.  They're
great guys and deserve it.

Just wrote another press release that's being posted
today on our web site, about Duke 3D winning a bunch
of awards at the Computer Game Developers Convention,
including Best Action Game (for the second year in
a row).

And so it begins, my first finger update...

Today is a Big News day, with the announcement that
Duke Nukem Forever will use id Software's Quake
technology.  This news leaked a few days ago and the
big question posed so far online is why aren't we
using our Prey technology.  We answered this with
a press release on www.3drealms.com, currently News
item #2.

The short answer is that if we had used the Prey
engine we would have to delay Duke 4's release
because the Prey engine is still a work-in-progress.
Inevitably, both Duke 4 and Prey would end up
coming out very close to each other and that's not a
good thing for the best success of each of those
games.

Plus, we want Prey to be the flagship game to use our
Prey technology--makes sense I hope.

We carefully reviewed the Unreal engine, too, which
is a stunning engine, but the decision for us came
down to the fact that the Quake technology was done
and user tested, allowing us to get Duke 4 out much
sooner than if we had gone with the Unreal engine.
And now that Quake will support colored lighting, the
gap between these two engines has closed
significantly.

I want to thank Tim Sweeney, Mark Rein and Jay
Wilbur for visiting us at a moment's notice and
presenting us a deal that was very hard to pass up.
Players have a lot to look forward to with Unreal.

With Prey and Duke 4 heavily in development, we've
got a lot to be excited about around here.  But the
game of the moment for us is Shadow Warrior, which I
believe is really going to surprise people in a few
weeks when the shareware version is expected to hit
the digital streets.

A recent preview in GameSlice Weekly said that
"Shadow Warrior cremates the competition..." and while
that might be a bit too bold I think that players are
going to be mostly happy by what they get in this
game, especially if they are fans of Duke Nukem 3D.

Finally, I've been interviewed several times by the
press lately and a common question is, "Why are there
so many development groups in the Dallas, Texas area?"
The truth is that most of the big names (Id, Ion,
Hipnotic) are here because Apogee was here first.  Id
moved to this area to be near Apogee (we were their
shareware publisher at the time, and when they moved
here Wolfenstein 3D was just beginning).

The rest of the groups eventually branched off from
Apogee and id, or a combination of the two (as in Ion's
case).  (A few others, such as 7th Level and Terminal
Reality are not here in connection with Apogee--though
3D Realms did release Terminal Reality's first game,
Terminal Velocity.)

Dallas is a great area for game development because
it's basically a high tech city, there's not a lot
of distractions, like the beach or snow skiing, and
the cost of living is relatively low, especially
compared to the Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and
California in general.  There's not a state tax,
either.
