========================================
April 30, 1997

Just wrote another press release that's being posted
today on our web site, about Duke 3D winning a bunch
of awards at the Computer Game Developers Convention,
including Best Action Game (for the second year in
a row).

Also just read Mike Hadwin's (of Hipnotic) attempt at
trying to be clever on his finger.  It's too bad people
can't stay busy making games rather than posting
messages designed to be attacks on the competition.
It must really irk him that we're one of the world's
most respected and profitable developers, in spite of
his feeling that we're just copycats to id.  Gee, I
guess Hipnotic *isn't* making another Quake/Duke-clone
and is going to do something original. 

Mike, ask Romero what he thought of our Prey demo?
I heard from our friends at CDGC that the Prey demo
was one of the big buzz topics.  Despite your contention
that Prey is dead or going nowhere, it's in fact
mostly done (engine-wise), and we're well into making
the game itself.  Who knows, Hipnotic might want to
license it someday.  ;)

Lastly, and another thing to be filed under "Aren't We
Immature":  We discovered yesterday, thanks to a user
who sent us a screen shot, that in Hipnotic's Quake
Mission Pack there's a room with three headstones with
the initials "SM", "GB" and "SB".  These are for
Scott Miller (me), George Broussard (my partner) and
Steven Blackburn (third in command here) respectively.
Now wasn't that clever of them?  :)

Hopefully, future finger updates won't have to sink
this low.  I apologize for having to bring this
public.

========================================
April 28, 1997

And so it begins, my first finger update...

Today is a Big News day, with the announcement that
Duke Nukem Forever will use id Software's Quake
technology.  This news leaked a few days ago and the
big question posed so far online is why aren't we
using our Prey technology.  We answered this with
a press release on www.3drealms.com, currently News
item #2.

The short answer is that if we had used the Prey
engine we would have to delay Duke 4's release
because the Prey engine is still a work-in-progress.
Inevitably, both Duke 4 and Prey would end up
coming out very close to each other and that's not a
good thing for the best success of each of those
games.

Plus, we want Prey to be the flagship game to use our
Prey technology--makes sense I hope.

We carefully reviewed the Unreal engine, too, which
is a stunning engine, but the decision for us came
down to the fact that the Quake technology was done
and user tested, allowing us to get Duke 4 out much
sooner than if we had gone with the Unreal engine.
And now that Quake will support colored lighting, the
gap between these two engines has closed
significantly.

I want to thank Tim Sweeney, Mark Rein and Jay
Wilbur for visiting us at a moment's notice and
presenting us a deal that was very hard to pass up.
Players have a lot to look forward to with Unreal.

With Prey and Duke 4 heavily in development, we've
got a lot to be excited about around here.  But the
game of the moment for us is Shadow Warrior, which I
believe is really going to surprise people in a few
weeks when the shareware version is expected to hit
the digital streets.

A recent preview in GameSlice Weekly said that
"Shadow Warrior cremates the competition..." and while
that might be a bit too bold I think that players are
going to be mostly happy by what they get in this
game, especially if they are fans of Duke Nukem 3D.

Finally, I've been interviewed several times by the
press lately and a common question is, "Why are there
so many development groups in the Dallas, Texas area?"
The truth is that most of the big names (Id, Ion,
Hipnotic) are here because Apogee was here first.  Id
moved to this area to be near Apogee (we were their
shareware publisher at the time, and when they moved
here Wolfenstein 3D was just beginning).

The rest of the groups eventually branched off from
Apogee and id, or a combination of the two (as in Ion's
case).  (A few others, such as 7th Level and Terminal
Reality are not here in connection with Apogee--though
3D Realms did release Terminal Reality's first game,
Terminal Velocity.)

Dallas is a great area for game development because
it's basically a high tech city, there's not a lot
of distractions, like the beach or snow skiing, and
the cost of living is relatively low, especially
compared to the Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and
California in general.  There's not a state tax,
either.
