Just got the Nov. issue of PC Gamer (448-packed pages!), which has Duke Nukem on
the cover and a 10-page info-packed spread on Duke Nukem Forever, along with several
sidebars on Prey, Max Payne and other subjects.  Jason Bates wrote this terrific
exclusive.  Folks, this article is all you're going to see about this game for many,
many months, except for maybe a rare screen shot here and there.  I highly recommend
that anyone at all remotely interested in Duke buy this issue.

The article was written before we made the decision to go with 16-bit source art,
which means these screen shots do not look nearly as good as the game currently
looks.  Also, there are a ton of break though ideas we're not mentioning publicly
until the game's release.  Our goal is not to over-expose and over-hype this game.

The article ends with this sentence:  "We're not fortune tellers, but we have every
confidence that Duke Nukem Forever will be the biggest--and perhaps the best--titles
of 1998."  That confidence is *not* misplaced.  ;)

BTW, the Quake 2 demo is pretty darn awesome.  Total Annihilation is awesome, too--the
best C&C game I've played.  The true 3D terrain (as opposed to faked attempts, e.g.
Dark Reign) and true 3D vehicles is the future of this genre, and TA is the pioneer.

Answer to last week's puzzle (which dozens of people have been asking for):

Man #1 and #2 cross first (2 minutes)
#1 returns (3 min. total)
#3 and #4 cross (13)
#2 returns (15)
#1 and #2 cross (17 total)

New puzzle:

Let's play Let's Make A Deal!  Monty Hall asks you to pick one of three curtains.
Behind one curtain is a car, behind another is a sofa, and behind another is a goat.
Obviously, all you care about is getting the car.  Let's say you picked curtain #1.
Monty, who knows what's behind each curtain, opens up curtain #2 and reveals the sofa.
Then he turns to you and says, "Tell ya what... I'll let you stay with curtain #1, or
switch to curtain #3."  The question is:  Is it beneficial to switch?

Bonus puzzle:

A car goes one lap around a mile long oval track at 30 mph.  How fast does the car
need to go on a second lap to average 60 mph for both laps?

Once again, please do not send me your answers or requests for answers.  I'm too
busy to respond to everyone.  The answers will be posted here next Friday.  Good luck.  :)

Non-game related pet peeves:

[1]  Saw Star Trek:  Voyager last week, the one in which Seven of Nine starts
turning back into a Borg, hijacks a shuttle and heads toward what she believes
is a Borg beacon.  My problem with this episode, and it's happened many times
before in the Star Trek universe, is that Seven was able to access a common
control panel in a corridor and basically take over the ship from there, shutting
out control from the bridge!  The bridge controls should be able to override
anything done anywhere else on the ship, but it seems like the bridge controls
always have the lowest priority on the ship.  This just drives me crazy.

[2]  Saw Voyager last night, too, which was a rerun (first time I'd seen it, though).
In the show, Q mentions that raising kids or something is not his *forte* (pronounced
by him as "for-tay").  I can't believe a TV show would allow this word to be
pronounced wrong.  In fact, I heard it pronounced this same way on ER recently, too.
I realize that most of the English-speaking world pronounces this word wrong (should be
pronounced as "fort" when meaning expertise, while the "for-tay" pronunciation has to
do with music), but for a TV show to make this blunder is just insane.  I don't even
use this word anymore because if I pronounce it correctly (as "fort") then people think
*I* don't know how to pronounce it, and if I pronounce it it as "for-tay" then I
perpetuate the madness.  ;)  What's interesting, though, is that because most people
pronounce this word "for-tay" the new editions of some dictionaries have succumb and are
allowing this as proper pronunciation.  So I guess it's all a moot point now.  :)

Other:

Finally, played disc golf yesterday and shattered my previous best score (59) by getting
a 56.  (Beating a personal best by three points is very rare when you've been playing for
two years already.)  For disc golf fans, this is the toughest course in the Dallas area
(tons of trees and dog leg holes) and it's 6800 feet long.  One of my playing partners
also got a personal best score (61), yet I still won $75 from him  ;)

If you love instrumental music with great guitars and inventive drumming, rush to buy
Black Light Syndrome, with Terry Bozzio (one of the world's best drummers--if I could only
play one tenth as well as him I'd die happy), Steve Stevens and Tony Levin.  Each of the 8
songs was recorded in one or two takes, and were "spontaneously composed."  This is CD of
the Year for me so far.

I love puzzles, and I'm always ambushing friends and co-workers with them.  Here's a
good one that recently came my way (it took me about three minutes to solve).  Don't
send me your answer or request the answer.  I will post the answer here soon enough.

The puzzle:  It's midnight.  There's a narrow bridge over a deep chasm.  There's one
flashlight that has just enough power to stay lit another 17 minutes.  There are four
men that need to cross the bridge.  Only one or two men can cross at a time, and the
flashlight is always needed to cross.

Man #1 can cross in 1 minute.
Man #2 in 2 minutes.
Man #3 in 5 minutes.
Man #4 in 10 minutes.

When two men cross at the same time they go at the speed of the slowest man.
(Example:  #1 and #3 cross, it takes five minutes, then #1 comes back alone with
the light, and that's six minutes total.)  There's nothing silly such as tossing
the flashlight.  Can you get all four men across before the flashlight runs out?

If anyone has a really good puzzle, feel free to send it to me, and send the answer
in a separate email with the exact same message heading.  Have fun...

Cowboys will get scalped by the 'Skins, 30 - 20.  Cowboys are looking sad.  I predict
maybe five more wins.  :(

Been watching people around the office play Jedi Knight.  Looks like a fun game
(great sound effects), though I wish the levels had better shadowing effects--the
lack of contrast gives the game a dated look.  However, LucasArts has a giant
advantage in having the Star Wars universe to base games on.  This advantage pretty
much insures that anything they do associated with Star Wars will be a big hit.
Must be nice.  ;)

Also, I'm looking forward to Activision's Battlezone.  The was an arcade favorite
of mine (I could play indefinitely on one quarter, and often played for hours at a
time hunting down those saucers).  The only problem I foresee is in recreating the
original Battlezone controls.  That's the problem with porting arcade hits like
Robotron, Missile Command and Tempest to the PC--without the original custom controls
those games are not nearly as fun to play.

We've got a lot of good feedback on the Shadow Warrior novels.  Unlike the DOOM novels,
which were widely panned, the Shadow Warrior novels encompass an entirely original story,
with ties back to the game.  We'll have the first chapter available on our web site very
soon.  If you liked the Destroyer series, you'll like the Shadow Warrior novels, too.

In stores soon with be the Duke Nukem Kill-o-Ton Collection, which puts in one oversized
box everything ever released relating to Duke Nukem, Duke Nukem 2, and Duke Nukem 3D.
This will be Duke's second Xmas--the game came out early in '96 and is still selling
better than most games recently released.  On CGW's "Playing Lately" list Duke 3D is at
position #6, and has been on the list 19 months straight, longer than any other game.
In Europe it's been #1 or #2 on the Budget Top Ten for six months straight.  In the
history of games, there's been maybe a handful that have sold more on a PC.  The N64
version already has store pre-orders over 300,000 in the USA alone.  The PSX version has
incredible pre-order numbers, too.  Things are looking good for Duke.  :)  Then there's
the collectors statue, action figures, novels, secret PSX project, Sega Duke, Tiger
Electronic's two Duke games, Genesis Duke, the movie, the Duke table in Balls of Steel,
and Duke Nukem Forever.  Maybe one day Duke will be bigger than Star Wars!  (Okay, you
can lock me up and throw away the key now.  )

Finally, Cowboys chop Giants down to size, 27 - 17.  It might be another sloppy win, but
we'll take it.  :)

An observation:  In the last two days I've read through the new Computer Gaming
World, Next Generation and PC Games magazines.  It occurred to me reading through
all the game previews that it's amazing how much attention games get before they're
even released.  It used to not be this way.

During the 80's and even early 90's most games were first mentioned in the reviews
section, after they were released.  Rarely were games previewed, or talked about
before their release.  One reason is because games mostly took 6 - 9 months to make,
so there was no reason to talk about a game before it was done.  Of course, now games
take about two years, so there's much more time to talk about them before they're
released.  Also, there wasn't the online game community like there is now, which
excites players into wanting to know more and more about games on the horizon.

Next Generation gives each previewed game at least a full page article, while their
reviews area rarely gives a game a full page, usually about a half-page.  Something
seems screwed up here, but I'm sure they know best what their readers want.  And what
we want is to quench our insatiable thirst to know what's ahead, and is it any better?

Let's hope so.


BTW, thanks for correcting your mistake, Brian.

*  Soon after Duke 3D's release we were asked to do a PC game version of Men in Black,
which we turned down (games based on movies rarely do well, unless it's a Star Wars game).
Last week a major studio contacted us about doing a game based on a sure-hit futuristic
movie coming next summer (can't say the name, under NDA).  The problem is that we're
knee-deep in Prey and Duke 4, so these are not projects we can realistically get involved
with, but it's still fun to get the offers.

*  The just out issue of Boot Magazine (w/ Alex St. John on the cover) has a
column titled "Game Theory" by T. Liam McDonald, that talks about the controversy
surrounding our just-released Shadow Warrior.  Part of what he says:  "3D Realms
has an uncanny knack for pissing people off about the content of its games...But
to some, they stepped over the line with Shadow Warrior...Is it offensive?  Sure.
Is it funny?  It's freakin' hysterical.  Should we be upset that it's offensive?
Hardly."  McDonald makes several strong points in his column, and I highly
recommend reading it.

*  18 months after Duke Nukem 3D's release and it's still getting covers on
magazines!  This time the Sept/Oct issue of Music & Computers
(www.music-and-computers.com), which has a great feature story about sound
artist Bobby Prince, who got his start through Apogee in 1991 (I found him in
a music forum on Prodigy ).  Bobby has since done work on these games:
Commander Keen, Duke Nukem 2 and 3D, Wolfenstein 3-D, Bio Menace, Realms of
Chaos, Rise of the Triad, Xenophage, Blake Stone, id's DOOM 1 and 2 and many
with other developers.  Truly one of the industry's top talents and
nice guys.  Visit his site at www.bpmusic.com.

*  Okay, still licking my wounds from last weeks Cowboys' crashing, but the
lowly Eagles are soaring into town for Dallas' first home game, and even
though they're green with envy over the Cowboys' three Superbowl wins in five
years, they're going to be leaving Texas feeling blue--Cowboys blue, that is:  23 - 17.

June 5, 1997

Digging through my library of computer books I've kept for
the past 20 years, I came across Dvorak's Guide to PC
Telecommunications, released in 1990 (over 1050 pages long).
There's a chapter on shareware, which contains this text:
"Shareware is not a good plan for all programs...As a rule,
the following genres of shareware programs haven't been
clearly successful:  Games, Utilities & Vertical programs."

For games specifically, Dvorak comments:  "Game players
tire of the game and decide not to register.  Some see
games as trivial--something to play with, but certainly
not to pay for.  Younger game users just don't have the
money to pay for games."

A visionary Dvorak was not!  ;)

However, in all fairness, games did do poorly when
released as shareware up until Apogee showed the world
how to do it properly with our breakthrough technique
of rele
