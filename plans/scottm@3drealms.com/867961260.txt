* Prey got a full paragraph in the New York Times today, along with
about 10 other games (from the 1500 at E3).  Just more praise heaped
onto the project and its next-generation Portal Technology.  Also,
The Adrenaline Vault has given me a preview of their coming Prey
write up, which I won't spoil for anyone, but it's basically
saying that Prey will redefine the 3D shooter market when it arrives.

* John Galt, the voice of Lo Wang, visited our offices and we
recording a lot of stuff pertaining to Elliott Chin's CGW missive
to us about racism in Shadow Warrior.  We'll be posting this
stuff on our web site within a week or so, and it should be
funny stuff.

* Looks like a Duke toy action figure is coming out for Xmas.
We're meeting with the manufacturer next week to review what
they've done so far (which is very cool--their whole positioning
is based on *quality*, and they did the Lost World action line).
We're also going to have them help us design some very unusual
characters for Duke Nukem Forever, both for the game and more
action figure toys.

* PC Magazine has a list of the top 100 influential computer
companies of all time.  I wrote to them stating that it was a
major goof to leave Apogee off the list, especially given some
of the companies that made the list which definitely had far
less of an impact than Apogee has had.  Id Software (at #30)
is incorrectly given credit for inventing shareware marketing
for games, which is a fairly common mistake among the press, who
I've found are quite ignorant on the whole subject of shareware.
Hopefully, my letter to them will get printed in a coming issue
and set the record straight.

* Men in Black is the best action event movie of the year but
that's not saying a lot considering what's come out.  It's
Ghostbusters meets Independence Day, but not nearly as incredibly
stupid as ID4.  Saw trailers for Spawn and The Peacemaker that
look very promising.

An open letter to Elliott Chin, "Action" columnist of Computer Gaming
World:


Dear Elliott Chin:

In the just-out August 1997 issue of Computer Gaming World magazine,
in your "Action" column, you attack 3D Realms, writing that "Shadow
Warrior's ignorant stereotypes are too offensive to stomach," and
"Shadow Warrior is a perfect example of a game that is patently
offensive in its racial humor and...shows great ignorance about its
very own subject matter."

You continue berating us, stating, "3D Realms didn't even try to
create an authentic or accurate Japanese, or East Asian, atmosphere.
Ninjas are Japanese, so why would the ninja hero be called Lo Wang,
which at best could be considered a dirty joke on a Chinese-sounding
name?  And why would Lo Wang pick up fortune cookies to gain health?"

Our reply to all of your criticisms is simple: We designed the game
this way on purpose.  In fact, we thought that our mixing of Asian
cultures was so outright obvious that no one could possibly
mistakenly think it was done from ignorance.  As another reviewer of
the game wrote: "It's a slam-bang tribute to the chop-socky movies we
all grew up with."  (From the Adrenaline Vault web site.)

I think you simply missed our point with this game.  We are having
fun with the whole Asian culture, and we blatantly mixed up all the
elements and cultures to make a fun game.  We're not trying to be
National Geographic here.  It's not our goal to make an educational
game, nor a game that's necessarily accurate to our world's
conditions--certainly Duke Nukem 3D is not a realistic game!

In fact, we try to be controversial with our games, which is why we
put the mating rabbits in the game.  It's why we use R-rated
language.  It's why we had Lo Wang speak in dubbed-movie-like
English.  (He can speak his native tongue, as well as three other
Asian languages, very fluently, as we discover in the soon-to-come
novels.  It's just his English that is not so good.)

As for his name, how do you know that Lo Wang's character is not
Chinese?  You wrongly assumed Lo Wang's character is Japanese simply
because the game takes place in our fictitious version of Japan.  You
should not judge a person by his name alone.  We would certainly not
have made any similar bold assumptions based on your name, and Lo
Wang, if real, would have expected the same from you.

We thoroughly disagree that we're being racist.  That's stretching
this way too far.  We're being stereotypical by design, but not
racist.  Big difference.  Does Redneck Rampage bother you, I wonder?
Surely it's just as stereotyped as Shadow Warrior.  The same issue of
CGW wrote about Redneck Rampage: "With more gut-quivering belches and
cheek-slapping butt whistles than a good ol' boy bloated on chicken
fried steak..."  What about the Superfly Johnson character from Ion
Storm's coming Daikatana?  Talk about a stereotypical name for an
African-American!  How about Tomb Raider's impossibly proportioned
Lara Croft?  Where are your criticisms for these games?

Next time I recommend you take the time to give us a call and see
what our side of the story might be?  A little fact checking and
background research never hurt anyone.  (By the way, 3D Realms has a
space in it, and Blood is not a 3D Realms game as wrongly stated in
CGW
