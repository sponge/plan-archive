A few concerns about Microsoft's coming X-Box console:

[1]  A big knock against all next-gen consoles, now that they have the graphics horse power 
to matter, is that TV screens are relatively low-resolution monitors that cannot deliver the 
clean, detailed images of a PC monitor.  Until HDTV is wide spread, this gives a BIG advantage 
to PCs.

[2]  Typically, in a given major market, only the top two brands will be highly successful, and 
I think everyone has good reason to believe Sony is a lock as one of those two.  Nintendo or 
Sega both have a very strong chance at being the other one, since both of those companies 
are solely focused on the gaming market and that gives them many business and marketing 
advantages.  Nintendo, ESPECIALLY, seems like a sure-thing because of their very strong 
gaming brands, like Zelda, Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, and PokÙ‰mon.  And even the PC itself 
must be considered a formidable game platform.

[3]  It's just not convenient or easy to use a mouse in front of a TV, so that's a big-time PC, 
and an advantage that makes games that are best played on PCs (FPS and RTS games, 
among others), often too hard to play on the X-Box as with the other consoles.

[4]  If Microsoft believes that anyone will want to use the Internet and do their email, etc. on 
a TV-based console system, they will been proven wrong.  I just don't see people putting up 
with that kind of hassle, and reading text on fuzzy TVs, and doing anything on the X-Box that 
is far better suited to a PC.  Maybe when a desk in front of TV screens become standard 
equipment, then consoles will have a prayer at becoming more than just a game machine.

[5]  I foresee that the majority of X-Box games will be enhanced ports of PC games.  This will 
be a serious problem for the X-Box's identity, because I don't see many developers making 
original content and brands for it--the majority of developers will still make games for the PC 
and then choose to port them to the X-Box.  I predict most developers who develop games 
for the PC will simply say, "Hey, let's do an X-Box version, too!"

[6]  It's hard to imagine that any hardcore PC game players will buy the X-Box.  People with 
PCs will stick with PCs because PCs are by far the better game playing machine (assuming the 
PC has a generally equal CPU and 3D graphics card, and PCs for sale when the X-Box comes 
out should easily exceed the X-Box's CPU power, and be close to equal with the 3D graphics 
card), because they easily support the mouse (you're setting at a desk!), and the monitor is 
capable of displaying text that's readable in something wider than a 50 column mode!  Also, 
the PC has many other applications, and it has a keyboard (imagine trying to play a FPS 
without a mouse and a keyboard--and think about all those keyboard shortcut keys for so 
many other games), making it the best all-in-one solution for most people.  Quite simply, few 
people with a PC, I think, will switch to the X-Box to play games when it's easier to stay put 
on the PC.  Sure, some people with older PCs may buy an X-Box to play high-end PC games, 
but I think that's a small percentage of us.  Overall, stripped down PCs that are reduced to 
game machines doesn't seem like a winning idea, because a PC is so much better, and PC 
prices are becoming much less a barrier for people who might otherwise buy a console 
machine.

In addition to these six points, I'll address a few comments I've seen in the press.  David 
Cage, CEO of Quantic Dream, is quoted as saying in the current issue of NextGen:  "[The] PC 
is probably condemned to disappear [as a game machine]...The reason is simple, you need to 
pay about five to ten times more to have a good PC than a console."  The fallacy with this 
comment is that people buy PCs to do more than play games, and they buy them for the 
complete package of things that can be done with them.  Quite simply, PCs will never be 
replaced by consoles as the preferred device to use the Internet and run other non-game 
applications--and even many game genres are better suited to PCs than consoles.

Rob Dyer, a V.P. with Eidos, says in the same article:  "I'm going way out on a limb, but I 
think the PC is going to cease to be any kind of viable platform within the next 18 to 24 
months.  It's going to be completely supplanted by Microsoft's X-Box or whatever else."  You 
have to admire a bold claim like this, but it just isn't going to happen.  PCs, due to their wide 
utility, will always be around, and always be a solid platform for game developers.  The X-Box 
will not replace the PC as a game platform, no way.

The X-Box will have near impossible time competing against the PC, PS2 and Dolphin.  And all 
four cannot succeed, the market cannot support this many successful game platforms.  
Microsoft of course has big money, so many people think that's an automatic win, but big 
money doesn't mean success, otherwise companies like Gateway, Dell and Compaq would 
have never had incredible success against IBM in the PC market. Influence and positioning are 
more important than money, and Sony and Nintendo both have far better positioning 
(Microsoft really isn't known as a game company by the general public), and both Sony and 
Nintendo have strong influence, too, probably better than Microsoft in the game channels.

The things that the X-Box will have in its favor, such as being a fixed and stable hardware 
platform, and a low price compared to PCs, may not be enough to overtake the other top 
consoles and the PC itself.  Strange as it may seem, the X-Box might have a better chance of 
being successful, IF it was not so much like the PC, inviting mostly PC ports rather than 
entirely original projects and brands.

Anyway, to paraphrase Dennis Miller, I may be proven wrong.  But I doubt it.

Just saw this:

"COMPUTER games do not prompt players to morph into anti-social, aggressive couch-
potatoes, a four-year Government-sponsored report has found...The nationwide report was 
commissioned by Federal and State Ministers with responsibility for censorship to investigate 
the extent of violence in computer and arcade games and the effect on players.  The majority 
of players feel happy, exhilarated, relaxed or challenged when playing, according to 
researchers, who witnessed 'very little overt aggression' in video arcades."

Xmas Eve, 1999

Lonely day at the office.  Since when did Christmas Eve become a non-work day? ;-)

I guess most people use today to get those last-second gifts.  This year I got practically all 
my gifts via online stores weeks ago.  For the most part things went well...

Amazon.com is easily the best place to order from online.  They make buying quicker or more
convenient than any other e-store I've used.  All of the Buy.com stores are also 
recommended.  On the other hand, www.Living.com still hasn't sent me all of my order that I 
placed mid-Nov.  Avoid that place at all costs.

www.EddieBauer.com hasn't quite figured out online commerce, either.  I placed an order with 
them and two days later they called me, leaving a voice message for me to return their call 
(without saying why).  Normally, I don't return calls like this, but luckily this time I did.  Turns 
out they were calling me to verify my address, and if I'd not called back they would not have 
shipped my order(!!!), and several of my family would have missed out on their presents.  No 
other site I've used calls back to verify the address!?  What's the point of taking advantage 
of the convenience of online ordering if you're going to be called back?  I ended up having an 
email conversation with the CEO if Eddie Bauer, and it's rather apparent she's old school and 
doesn't get It.

I ordered a few kid's toys from www.ZanyBrainy.com and after waiting two weeks for them to 
arrive, I checked my account and it looks like my order was never processed.  Maybe I should 
have e-shopped at eToys.com instead.

Finally, though ~ot Xmas shopping related, I tried www.NetGrocier.com, ordering about $16 
worth of house supplies, and shipping came to $8!  Not only was that outrageous, but you'd 
think that NetGrocier.com would have cheaper prices (making the shipping easier to swallow)
since they do to ~ot having actual stores, but you'd be thinking wrong.

Finally, a firm we work with sent us some cookies this week, and I've never had better 
cookies that weren't freshly home made.  Check out www.BrentAndSams.com, and specifically 
the Chocolate Chip Pecan and Key Lime/White Chocolate cookies.  You can easily order from 
this site and also send tins of these cookies (and several other varieties) as gifts.

My personal favs for 1999:

Movie:  Being John Malkovich

PC Game:  Unreal Tournament

Non-Fiction Book:  The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding

Music CD:  Jeff Beck's "Who Else!"

TV show:  X-Files.

An article about video game violence that desputes much of the
extreme preaching of Lieutenant Colonel David Grossman, who's
unfortunately become the press' favorite "expert" source.

Computer Games Magazine, Nov. 1999 issue, page B26, ("10 Essential First-Person
Shooters" by Steve Bauman, Editor-at-Large).

Duke Nukem 3D is listed among a hall-of-fame list of ten 3D shooters, although I 
would have put Wolfenstein 3-D in this list ahead of Outlaws, but that's ~ot the 
thing that needs correcting, that's just a minor blunder.

Far worse is this statement by Bauman:  "[Duke Nukem 3D's] most unfortunate legacy 
is the wise-cracking lead character (most of which was cribbed verbatim from Army 
of Darkness)..."

Hmmm, most lines taken from Army of Darkness?  Not even close.  Of the 100+ lines 
that Duke speaks in the game, there are only three, maybe four lines from AofD.  
The only three we can think of are "Hail to the king, baby," "Who wants some" and 
"Groovy."  Big whoop.  We borrowed several lines from other movies, too, but the 
vast majority of Duke-isms were created by us.  It looks like Bauman's attempt to 
blast Duke resulted in a self frag.

The above link points to a story about Gathering of Developers on Upside Today, a nice daily news 
site.

The story contains this paragraph:  >>>Ironically, the industry's largest third-party game 
producer, Electronic Arts, started with the same Hollywood studio/independent creator model that 
GOD ~ow preaches. "EA started with the same philosophy as GOD," says legendary developer Sid 
Meier, who runs Hunt Valley, Md.-based Firaxis Inc., which has a deal to make games that EA will 
publish.<<<

I've heard this misconception about Gathering several times.  Here's why it's wrong:  Gathering has 
a board of directors comprised of mostly developers.  The purpose of this developer-oriented board  
is to insure that Gathering does ~ot become a publisher in which developer issues and concerns 
become secondplace priorities.

No other publisher has a board of directors comprised of developers that is setting company policy 
and vision.  Already several times this board has made policies and decisions that are in favor of 
developers, where at other publishers these decisions would have gone in favor other the 
corporation.

EA did ~ot have a developer oriented board of directors to make sure their developer-oriented 
vision stayed in place, and that's why Gathering will succeed as a developer-oriented publisher 
where others have failed.

In the same article, Richard Hilleman, a VP at EA, says, "The more things change, the more they 
stay the same."  Hilleman is of course as wrong as Meier.  A publisher like the Gathering of 
Developers has been never attempted before, with proven developers helping to run the company
and maintain developer priorities.  With the Gathering it's the first time it's not Developers vs Suits, 
because the developers in this case are the suits.

The current PC Gamer and other recent magazine editions have run articles listing the best 50 or 
100 games of all time.  My concern is that these lists often don't include older, groundbreaking 
games.  For example, should not a game like Wolfenstein 3-D be included because it kicked-off the 
3D first-person shooter genre?  Should not Myst be a lock because it's the best selling game of all 
time, and therefore the most popular game in PC history?  And how can any such list omit 
revolutionary and great games like M.U.L.E., and Wing Commander, and Tetris?!

Any Best Games Ever list without these games can't be a Best Games Ever list.

Wolfenstein 3-D is outdated and surpassed by six years of technically better 3D shooters.  Same 
with the other games listed above.  And that's the problem with these lists:  They often don't take 
into account how influential and innovative a game was for its time.  Instead, these lists mostly 
comprise themselves with games released in the past few years.  Do lists of the Best Novels Ever 
or Best Movies Ever only contain recent titles?  Absolutely not.

This is why I prefer Computer Gaming World magazine
