What's wrong with AOL?  Here's one big problem:  They're running off
their top content providers in the gaming industry.  We're the latest to
receive a "Termination of Interactive Services Agreement" letter.  They're
closing down our AOL forum August 1st.  Sure, they'll let us keep it running,
but only if we agree to pay them $55,000 a year!  Yes, we get to pay AOL to
provide them content and make their service more valuable to their customers.
That's clever of them.  The result is that we're outta there, along with
several other top content providers, developers and publishers in our industry.
AOL is outsmarting themselves into oblivion.  The web is going to kill AOL
soon enough, but I guess they prefer to put a gun to their own head and get
it over with sooner rather than later.

(Note:  The following was edited due to it being perceived as too
inflammatory, which was not the intention.)

Just read on GameSpot (www.gamespot.com/previews/quake2/index.html) a
Quake 2 preview that contains scathing comments against John Romero by
members of id Software.  Id claims to be much, much better off with all
of their departures, saying they have a lean, more dedicated, better
focused team.  (Id's CEO also speaks on this subject on Inside Games at
http://www.actionworld.com/insidegames/.)

We've had a lot of turnover lately, too, and this has allowed us to
significantly improve the talent level within our company by hiring better
new people.  New people tend to be much more passionate and dedicated, plus
our ability to hire cream-of-the-crop talent continually improves, as well
as the talent level of developers who apply for positions here (thanks to
our continually improving reputation in the industry).

So I can see why id makes the comments they do about people leaving their
company, and their company being better off because of it.  We've
experienced the same phenomenon.

* I just want to reinforce what Jay "Shade" Wilson has written in his plan file
about the fact that Blood is not a 3D Realms game (which has been incorrectly
reported by a few press sources, such as CGW).  Blood was originally going to
be released by 3D Realms as shareware, with FormGen (remember them!) having
the retail rights.  At the time of the deal's inception, in 1994, Blood was being
developed by Q Studios, headed by Nick Newhard.

Over the course of the game's development, GT Interactive bought FormGen,
thus acquiring the game's retail distribution rights (actually, it wasn't this
straight forward, but the end result is the same), and Q Studios was acquired
by Monolith Productions.  3D Realms (knee deep in Duke ports, Shadow Warrior
development and Prey development) and Monolith both agreed it'd be better for
Blood's success to change the deal and remove 3D Realms out of the creative
loop.  This allowed them to focus totally on Blood, and allowed us to focus more
on the stuff we had going.  Basically, the deal became a simple Build engine
licensing deal for Monolith.  (This is much like what happened with Ruins,
another Build engine game, by Lobotomy Software, which became strictly a
Lobotomy game and a Build engine license arrangement.)

We've learned here that you shouldn't try to be involved with too many games at
a time because you'll lose focus and end up not doing anything really well.  That's
a big reason why we separated from both the Ruins and the Blood projects, and in
the end Blood was a better game because it allowed both companies to really
focus without distractions from the other company.

We've received literally hundreds of pro-3D Realms replies regarding
Elliott Chin's anti-Shadow Warrior article.  Everyone seems to agree
that Elliott got on the wrong high horse and missed the point that
the game is funny on purpose without being demeaning to Asians.

Here's one particularly well considered message I got last night,
and have gotten permission to post publicly (name withheld):

To 3D Realms:

I have not been a regular reader of Computer Gaming World, but when a copy
showed up in the waiting room of the company I work for, I figured I would
have a read  (Usually we only have computer trade mags).   Now I see what
I've been missing.  Since I don't like to make judgments based off of
isolated incidents I have to ask...Does Elliott Chin bash on every game that
has ethnic symbols, or is he a white bashing racist?

With my inflammatory remark out of the way, let me ask some questions and
point out some of the fallacies in Elliott Chins "review???" of 3D Realms'
Shadow Warrior.

1.  Elliott Chin claims to get offended when stereotypes are "slapped onto
retail products for consumers".  Is this the case or is it only when Asian
stereo types are used.  Did Chin write a full page article condemning
Vikings for their insulting and inaccurate portrayal of the Norse.  How
about Ultima for their use of medieval English stereo types.  What about
Redneck Rampage.  The list could go on to ask about thousands of games
since the dawn of video gaming.  (Lets just hope for Chins honor that we
are the only life in the universe, with all the alien stereotypes he
doesn't complain about.)

2.  Chin says that Shadow Warrior "shows great ignorance about it's very
own subject matter: East Asia and ninjas."  Duh!!  Is Chin offended that
the makers of Doom didn't take a course on demonology???  I will skip
exhaustive list of games that did not accurately portray their subject
matter.  That is what differentiates a simulation from a game.  I highly
doubt that 3D Realms was attempting to create a simulation.

3.  Chin got "increasingly offended" each time he heard a "white actor"
spouting fortune-cookie wisdom.  This is a direct racist statement.  No one
can see the actor, so his race is entirely irrelevant.  Being bad voice
actor may not be good for a persons career, but it certainly doesn't make
him a racist.  The situation more likely falls into the realm of the voice
actor was the developer with the funniest voice.  Would Chin have been
offended with a game that had a stereo typical "up-tight white voice"  or
how about "white trailer trash" voices (if Redneck Rampage as any voice in
it I assume it is trailer trash).  Using Chin's standards, the world would
have missed out on James Earl Jones doing the voice of Darth Vader since
the character was a white guy.  I for one am glad Chin wasn't involved in
that decision.

4.  Again Chin becomes offended because the authors got mixed up between
Chinese and Japanese.  I am sure that Chin would put as much effort into
bashing on a game company that had a Scottish character named O'hara that
was battling leprechauns.  You would do that wouldn't you Chin?.....Chin???

5.  Are we really to believe that having a game with an Asian theme using
fortune cookies as health power ups is racist?

It is obvious that Elliot Chin is so wrapped up in the color of his skin
that he has become a confused racist.

PS.  To all of the game developers...Remember...to gain Elliot Chin's seal
of approval, only stereo type white people.

* Prey got a full paragraph in the New York Times today, along with
about 10 other games (from the 1500 at E3).  Just more praise heaped
onto the project and its next-generation Portal Technology.  Also,
The Adrenaline Vault has given me a preview of their coming Prey
write up, which I won't spoil for anyone, but it's basically
saying that Prey will redefine the 3D shooter market when it arrives.

* John Galt, the voice of Lo Wang, visited our offices and we
recording a lot of stuff pertaining to Elliott Chin's CGW missive
to us about racism in Shadow Warrior.  We'll be posting this
stuff on our web site within a week or so, and it should be
funny stuff.

* Looks like a Duke toy action figure is coming out for Xmas.
We're meeting with the manufacturer next week to review what
they've done so far (which is very cool--their whole positioning
is based on *quality*, and they did the Lost World action line).
We're also going to have them help us design some very unusual
characters for Duke Nukem Forever, both for the game and more
action figure toys.

* PC Magazine has a list of the top 100 influential computer
companies of all time.  I wrote to them stating that it was a
major goof to leave Apogee off the list, especially given some
of the companies that made the list which definitely had far
less of an impact than Apogee has had.  Id Software (at #30)
is incorrectly given credit for inventing shareware marketing
for games, which is a fairly common mistake among the press, who
I've found are quite ignorant on the whole subject of shareware.
Hopefully, my letter to them will get printed in a coming issue
and set the record straight.

An open letter to Elliott Chin, "Action" columnist of Computer Gaming
World:


Dear Elliott Chin:

In the just-out August 1997 issue of Computer Gaming World magazine,
in your "Action" column, you attack 3D Realms, writing that "Shadow
Warrior's ignorant stereotypes are too offensive to stomach," and
"Shadow Warrior is a perfect example of a game that is patently
offensive in its racial humor and...shows great ignorance about its
very own subject matter."

You continue berating us, stating, "3D Realms didn't even try to
create an authentic or accurate Japanese, or East Asian, atmosphere.
Ninjas are Japanese, so why would the ninja hero be called Lo Wang,
which at best could be considered a dirty joke on a Chinese-sounding
name?  And why would Lo Wang pick up fortune cookies to gain health?"

Our reply to all of your criticisms is simple: We designed the game
this way on purpose.  In fact, we thought that our mixing of Asian
cultures was so outright obvious that no one could possibly
mistakenly think it was done from ignorance.  As another reviewer of
the game wrote: "It's a slam-bang tribute to the chop-socky movies we
all grew up with."  (From the Adrenaline Vault web site.)

I think you simply missed our point with this game.  We are having
fun with the whole Asian culture, and we blatantly mixed up all the
elements and cultures to make a fun game.  We're not trying to be
National Geographic here.  It's not our goal to make an educational
game, nor a game that's necessarily accurate to our world's
conditions--certainly Duke Nukem 3D is not a realistic game!

In fact, we try to be controversial with our games, which is why we
put the mating rabbits in the game.  It's why we use R-rated
language.  It's why we had Lo Wang speak in dubbed-movie-like
English.  (He can speak his native tongue, as well as three other
Asian languages, very fluently, as we discover in the soon-to-come
novels.  It's just his English that is not so good.)

As for his name, how do you know that Lo Wang's character is not
Chinese?  You wrongly assumed Lo Wang's character is Japanese simply
because the game takes place in our fictitious version of Japan.  You
should not judge a person by his name alone.  We would certainly not
have made any similar bold assumptions based on your name, and Lo
Wang, if real, would have expected the same from you.

We thoroughly disagree that we're being racist.  That's stretching
this way too far.  We're being stereotypical by design, but not
racist.  Big difference.  Does Redneck Rampage bother you, I wonder?
Surely it's just as stereotyped as Shadow Warrior.  The same issue of
CGW wrote about Redneck Rampage: "With more gut-quivering belches and
cheek-slapping butt whistles than a good ol' boy bloated on chicken
fried steak..."  What about the Superfly Johnson character from Ion
Storm's coming Daikatana?  Talk about a stereotypical name for an
African-American!  How about Tomb Raider's impossibly proportioned
Lara Croft?  Where are your criticisms for these games?

Next time I recommend you take the time to give us a call and see
what our side of the story might be?  A little fact checking and
background research never hurt anyone.  (By the way, 3D Realms has a
space in it, and Blood is not a 3D Realms game as wrongly stated in
CGW
