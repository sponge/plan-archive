Balls of Steel (shareware) will be released tomorrow.  The retail version will be in
stores next week.  I've played all other pinball games released in the past two years,
studied them, enjoyed a few of them (like Full Tilt 2), but in my trying-to-be-unbiased
opinion, Balls is the best.  This game was developed by a small team in Australia,
Wildfire Studios.  It shows what a small, focused, talented team can do.

A very cool feature of this game is that it allows you to post your high scores on a web
site (www.worldscores.com) to compare with other players, but only if you're playing the
game in Tournament Mode, which happens to be the mode that's available in the shareware
version.

Our publisher, GTIS, said that Duke for the PlayStation and N64 are exceeding sales
expectations, and re-orders are already in progress.  I think part of the success is
that these are much more than straight ports because levels were redesigned, new levels
and weapons added, secrets rearranged, and new Duke one-liners added.

Started playing Uprising, just got through the training missions so far.  Seems like a
fun game, but I can't see that it supports 3Dfx, which would greatly increase my enjoyment.
It's hard to play games now that are software-only -- kind of like watching b/w TV after
seeing what color TV looks like.

Duke Nukem 64 (N64) and Duke Nukem Total Meltdown (PlayStation) are both getting
rave reviews from the press, with almost all scores in the 90's (out of 100).
Total PlayStation magazine gave Duke a 95% rating, one of the highest ever by its
standards.

There are several significant publishers who are showing a deep interest in
licensing Prey's engine and tools.  No one who has seen Prey has said they've seen
anything else that can compare to it, technology-wise, including the CPU makers such
as Cyrix, who've visited many times recently.  We're not looking to close any tech
licensing deals until next year, at which time we'll leave it to the licensee to
first announce.

The Puzzle:  You have 12 balls.  All weigh the same except one, which is either
heavier or lighter (you don't know which) than the other 11.  You have a balance
scale (the kind with two hanging platters), and you have three turns to use it to find
the odd ball.  Can you do it?  (Thanks to Dirk Stevens for submitting this puzzle.)

Final testing on the shareware version of Balls of Steel is happening.  Should be
released within 10 days, maybe 5.

I rate Alien Resurrection a 6 (the first two are 10's and the 3rd rates a solid 2).
After seeing Aliens (the second movie) I thought there were two more movies that
needed to be made (as opposed to the two sequels that have been made):  In the first
they capture a Queen, bring her to Earth for study, and all hell breaks loose (a bit
like Alien 4 in which they study the aliens, but I would have done more research on
them and shown that they were highly intelligent and explained their motives, etc.).
In the second (fourth and final overall) we decide that these aliens are simply too
dangerous for the universe and a galactic-wide hunt for their planet ensues.  We find
other planets totally wiped out by them along the way, and even find the home planet
for the huge ship in the first Alien movie (wouldn't you love to see more explanation
on those aliens?).  The message is that anyone that messes with these aliens perishes.
We do find their home world but nuking it won't work because they live underground almost
like ants.  We have to go to their planet and there we see much more of their history and
why they're so tough and adaptable.  In the end, after a massive but failed battle, we
realize we cannot destroy them nor their planet, so we rule that all space within 10
parsecs is off limits, by penalty of death.  Before the closing credits we see a military
craft entering the alien planet atmosphere and the ship's commander is saying to his
military crew, "We can learn from them, they are the ultimate weapon.  All we need is one
to breed..."  Of course, we never learn.

Duke news:  The N64 version of Duke is out.  The Duke Kill-A-Ton Collection is now
hitting stores.  Nuclear Winter, a Duke 3D level pack, should be hitting stores in
a week, and Life's a Beach, the final Duke 3D level pack, will hit stores early Dec.

Got milestone #7 of Max Payne yesterday, which showed a huge leap in progress.  There's
already 12 characters, and plenty of jaw-dropping special effects I haven't seen in other
games.  Remedy Entertainment, the developer, is showing off their demo scene roots.

Weekly puzzle:

How quickly can you find what is so unusual about this paragraph?  It looks so ordinary
that you might think nothing was wrong with it at all and, in fact, nothing is.  But it
is unusual. Why?  If you study it, and think about it, you may find out, but I am not
going to assist you in any way. . . you must do it without coaching.  No doubt, if you
work on it long it will dawn on you.  Go to work now and try your skill or luck.  Par
is about half an hour.

We're very close to having our 3rd Prey level designer, Martinus, join us.  This is
an interesting hire because he's is from Germany, and we've been working with our
immigration attorney for over five months to bring him into our country.  One of
the big problems is that there's not an official job for level designer within the
Immigration Services' national database, so matters were not as clean-cut as they
could have been.

But all the hurdles have finally been jumped, and I just got done signing a dozen
signatures on a multitude of documents, petitions and forms that will finally clear
the way for Martinus to make the move.  Why go through all the trouble and expense to
hire him?  I'll let Paul answer that one...

Got our stand-up Forgotten Worlds arcade machine yesterday, which is *not* Black Tiger,
as reported in someone else's plan several weeks ago.  ;)  It's a lot tougher than I
remember--took me six continues to beat it today.  It's funny that one of the two
characters in that game looks a lot like Duke, even so far as wearing shades.  This
game pre-dates Duke by nearly four years, so maybe we were subliminally influenced.

*  Why is it that nearly every article I read about a coming 3D first-person shooter
mentions that the game will--gasp!--have an integrated story and plot, as if few or
none of the other coming 3D shooters will?  As far as I can tell, *all* coming 3D
shooters will do a much, much better job at integrating a story.  This is not shocking
news.  It's simply a required evolutionary step for these games to make, and all major
players are taking this step.

*  Half-Life, Daikatana and Unreal have all given up on making this Xmas, which I
think each of these games originally intended to make.  This is a testament that 3D games,
with realistic 3D worlds, are *very* tough to make, and this is compounded at companies
that have never made a 3D shooter before and are overcoming unexpected hurdles.  The
stakes and standards in this genre are so high now that no one can afford to make a bomb
or even an okay-seller, and that, too, adds to the development time.  Personally, I enjoy
the supremely high level of competition in this genre, as it keeps us thinking of new
innovations and new ways to out-smart what everyone else is doing.  At least, that's what
we hope we're doing.  ;)

Halloween Day

The Sega port of Duke Nukem 3D scored a 5/5 in one of England's top game mags.
The N64 version has already landed three covers.  Then you have the PlayStation
version coming in about a month and it has received exceptional previews, too.
Looks like Duke is dressing up as Santa this Xmas.  Ho ho ho.  :)

Like Shadow Warrior or not, I recommend you spend a few minutes reading the first
chapter of the first Shadow Warrior novel, which is online at www.3drealms.com,
visit "Latest Apogee/3D Realms News!", then click on the book cover.  This chapter
is totally cool and hilarious--you will not be disappointed.

Bought Fallout, Lands of Lore and Ultima Online yesterday.  I rarely have time to
finish games I start, but I like to at least check them out to see if there are
any good ideas to use for inspiration (or to steal :).  Total Annihilation
continues to be a total blast.

This week's puzzle is a bit tougher, and one of my favorites:

There's a narrow railroad bridge crossing a deep chasm.  You're walking along it
having made it seven tenths of way so far, when suddenly you hear a train coming.
You know that this train always travels 50 mph, but because the area is mountainous
you're not sure which way the train is coming from.  Instantaneously reacting, you
randomly pick a direction to run and just dive off the bridge as the train roars by
you, almost killing you.  How fast (average speed) where you running to escape death?

Once again, please do not send me your answers or requests for the solution.
3D Portal typically has the solution online within a day or two.

Just got the Nov. issue of PC Gamer (448-packed pages!), which has Duke Nukem on
the cover and a 10-page info-packed spread on Duke Nukem Forever, along with several
sidebars on Prey, Max Payne and other subjects.  Jason Bates wrote this terrific
exclusive.  Folks, this article is all you're going to see about this game for many,
many months, except for maybe a rare screen shot here and there.  I highly recommend
that anyone at all remotely interested in Duke buy this issue.

The article was written before we made the decision to go with 16-bit source art,
which means these screen shots do not look nearly as good as the game currently
looks.  Also, there are a ton of break though ideas we're not mentioning publicly
until the game's release.  Our goal is not to over-expose and over-hype this game.

The article ends with this sentence:  "We're not fortune tellers, but we have every
confidence that Duke Nukem Forever will be the biggest--and perhaps the best--titles
of 1998."  That confidence is *not* misplaced.  ;)

Been watching people around the office play Jedi Knight.  Looks like a fun game
(great sound effects), though I wish the levels had better shadowing effects--the
lack of contrast gives the game a dated look.  However, LucasArts has a giant
advantage in having the Star Wars universe to base games on.  This advantage pretty
much insures that anything they do associated with Star Wars will be a big hit.
Must be nice.  ;)

Also, I'm looking forward to Activision's Battlezone.  The was an arcade favorite
of mine (I could play indefinitely on one quarter, and often played for hours at a
time hunting down those saucers).  The only problem I foresee is in recreating the
original Battlezone controls.  That's the problem with porting arcade hits like
Robotron, Missile Command and Tempest to the PC--without the original custom controls
those games are not nearly as fun to play.

We've got a lot of good feedback on the Shadow Warrior novels.  Unlike the DOOM novels,
which were widely panned, the Shadow Warrior novels encompass an entirely original story,
with ties back to the game.  We'll have the first chapter available on our web site very
soon.  If you liked the Destroyer series, you'll like the Shadow Warrior novels, too.

Sept. 30, 1997

An observation:  In the last two days I've read through the new Computer Gaming
World, Next Generation and PC Games magazines.  It occurred to me reading through
all the game previews that it's amazing how much attention games get before they're
even released.  It used to not be this way.

During the 80's and even early 90's most games were first mentioned in the reviews
section, after they were released.  Rarely were games previewed, or talked about
before their release.  One reason is because games mostly took 6 - 9 months to make,
so there was no reason to talk about a game before it was done.  Of course, now games
take about two years, so there's much more time to talk about them before they're
released.  Also, there wasn't the online game community like there is now, which
excites players into wanting to know more and more about games on the horizon.

Next Generation gives each previewed game at least a full page article, while their
reviews area rarely gives a game a full page, usually about a half-page.  Something
seems screwed up here, but I'm sure they know best what their readers want.  And what
we want is to quench our insatiable thirst to know what's ahead, and is it any better?

Let's hope so.

*  Soon after Duke 3D's release we were asked to do a PC game version of Men in Black,
which we turned down (games based on movies rarely do well, unless it's a Star Wars game).
