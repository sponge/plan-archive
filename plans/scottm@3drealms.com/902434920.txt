Finally got a new system:  P2-400 with Voodoo2, 128k RAM and 11gig drive.  I can finally play Sin and Unreal in realtime.  (Not a dig against these fine games, but the fact is that my old system 
couldn't handle these games without lots of hitching.)  Anyway, it's nice to be back on the leading 
edge again, even if it'll probably only last for a few months!

Wowzer!  Another uncreative developer just copying the genius that is LucasArts:

BitchX finally publicly revealed.  She's someone we used to work with and had a great business 
relationship with.  I hope this isn't the end to her game gossip site.

Why is there more actual lemon in most Lemon-scented dishwater soaps than in Country Time 
Lemonade?

Video Game Patent Fight News:  Still ongoing and still costing us 10's of $1000's to fight.  It's clear 
that we're not violating it, but the Bad Guys (patent holders) don't know when they're beat, and 
won't give up.  Sheesh.  It's too bad the SPA doesn't have the balls to help us out.

Max Payne milestone #10 came in this week.  Much cool stuff.  Things are reaching a "game" stage, 
and fast progress should ensue.

Puzzle:  You're in a car in the northern part of the Artic, with the car pointing due north on an 
ordinary but straight paved road.  You drive for exactly one mile, without turning, and end up one 
mile south of where you started.  How?

Sequels:  The Lame Name Game

Advice to publishers and developers of sequels:  Stop using the ultimate lame
name device:  sequel numbers.

3D Realms will never have a game title like Duke Nukem 4, Max Payne 2 or Prey
2.  We think those "sequel numbers" that follow a game's title are both
uncreative and lame.  Many movie sequels have equally lame titles, like the
Lethal Weapon sequels, the Godfather sequels and the Rocky sequels.

As an alternative, look at movie sequels that avoid using the lameness of
sequel numbers.  The Star Wars sequels, thank George, are not named Star Wars 2
and Star Wars 3.  Same with the Indiana Jones sequels, each having its own
original name, making each movie seem more like an episode in a TV series. 
George Lucas has figured out the sequel name game.

The Batman sequels, the Alien sequels, and the James Bond series also rely on
each movie having its own unique name, rather than simply attaching a lame
sequel number.  But some sequels try to have it both ways, going with a sequel
number and a new subtitle, like Speed 2:  Cruise Control, but this doesn't
work--the lameness of the sequel number is still there, plus the name is way
too long.  Why not just name the movie Cruise Control and lose the Speed
reference?   (E.g.  The sequel to Jurassic Park wasn't Jurassic Park 2: The
Lost World, it was simply The Lost World.  Lameness avoided!)

From a marketing standpoint, sequel numbers seem like a good idea, because they
build upon the awareness and equity built into the original title, but in the
long run they are detrimental because they look like rehashes of the original
product, rather than stand alone original works on their own.

Tomb Raider 2 and Tomb Raider 3 are both extremely lame titles.  If Eidos had
as much guts as their star character they'd have instead followed the Indiana
Jones model for their game titles:  Raiders of the Lost Ark is equivalent to
the first Tomb Raider title, in that in neither one is the starring character's
name used.  But in the next two movies Lucas wisely emphasized Harrison Ford's
character in the titles (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana
Jones and the Final Crusade).  The second and third Lara Croft games should
have followed this same model, with names like Lara Croft and the Lost City (or
whatever is appropriate to the each game's story).

The continued use of the Tomb Raider name in the sequels is lame in another
respect, too, because it forces each game to take place in a tomb location
every game, otherwise the title doesn't make sense.  Eidos is really missing
the boat by not emphasizing the Lara Croft character in their game titles, and
freeing up the versatility of the game's locations.

At 3D Realms, we don't even view games as sequels, we think of them as new
episodes in an on-going TV series.  Who thinks of each TV episode as a sequel
to the previous episode?  No one.  We apply the same thinking to our games and
our game titles, and so you'll never see a game named Duke Nukem 4, just like
an episode of X-Files isn't titled X-Files 117.

Here are more lame examples of sequel numbered games:

Warlords III:  Darklords Rising -- Why not simply Darklords Rising?

Blood 2:  The Chosen -- Why not just The Chosen?  Is connecting this game to
Blood really that beneficial!?  Look at DreamWorks' game, Trespasser, which
thankfully avoided the lame alternative, The Lost World: Trespasser--someone
had the smarts to realize they didn't need to blatantly attach "The Lost World"
brand to this game's title.

Might and Magic VI:  The Mandate of Heaven -- Why not just The Mandate of
Heaven and somewhere on the box have a Might and Magic logo, like James Bond
has the 007 logo?

Jazz Jackrabbit 2 -- I would have gone with the title Jazz and Spaz instead,
since both characters are emphasized heavily in this game and on the box front.

KKND2:  Krossfire -- Why not just Krossfire?  And if that's trademarked
already, then think of something else as klever.

Need for Speed III:  Hot Pursuit -- Should just be Hot Pursuit with a Need for
Speed logo somewhere on the box front.

Descent:  Freespace:  The Great War -- No sequel number, but this name is just
out of control!  And why it's attached to the Descent series I can't figure
out, what are we descending into?

To be fair, Apogee has had one lame sequel name, Duke Nukem 2 in 1993, but
since that time we got a clue.  Better late than never.

Due to semi-popular demand, I'll toss out a few puzzles:

[1]  One of the following words (not the obvious one!) doesn't belong, which
one and why?  (oriole, orange, month, oil)

[2]  Mayor Manley loved women so much he devised a new law that he hoped would
ensure the birth of more females.  The law stated that any couple having
children could only have kids until their first boy, then they could have no
more.  What effect would this law have on the male/female population ratio?

[3]  You have a steel box, a perfect cube shape, with the top off.  The box is
5 inches on each side, making its volume 125 cubic inches.  Inside the box is a
solid steel ball-bearing that is 25 cubic inches in size.  You have a large
container of liquid mercury--how much mercury would you need to pour into the
box to completely submerge the ball bearing?

News Bulletin:  DWANGO Beware!

Oh no!  Will DWANGO be next?!  (http://www.dwango.com/)

Their eyeball logo is surely a rip-off of the LucasArts logo.  And after all,
considering LucasArts' prominence in the computer game industry, it is hard to
believe that the DWANGO logo was not copied from the LucasArts logo!  (At
least, that's what LucasArts' attorney's might believe, like they did with the
Remedy Entertainment logo.)

Who's eyeball will be poked out next by LucasArts?  We may soon see!


News Bulletin:  Melbourne House Beware!

Yikes!, Melbourne House (makers of KKND and KKND2 for EA) also has a logo with
an eyeball:  http://www.melbournehouse.com/.  I can't believe they would so
blatantly copy the LucasArts logo!  Don't they know that the prominence of
LucasArts in the computer industry means that anyone with an eye in their logo
MUST be copying the creative geniuses at LucasArts and their brilliant logo.
Apparently, LucasArts owns the eyeball idea, and they're ready to "socket" to
anyone else who's similarly brilliant.

Watch out guys, expect LucasArts to send Darth Vader your way!

Unfortunately for us developers, the Farce is among us.

News Bulletin:  Developers Beware!

It seems the attorneys at LucasArts think that the Remedy Entertainment
company logo (can be viewed here: http://www.maxpayne.com/) is too similar to
the LucasArts logo.

FYI, Remedy Entertainment is working with 3D Realms to develop the PC game Max
Payne, which recently garnered a great deal of positive feedback from the
recent showing at the Gathering of Developers' E3 booth.

A letter (dated July 9) from LucasArts' attorney, John Sullivan, of Fenwick
and West LLP, claimed:  "The Remedy Entertainment logo so closely resembles
the top portion of the LucasArts logo, which, like the Remedy Entertainment
logo, forms an eye, that, considering LucasArts' prominence in the computer
game industry, it is hard to believe that the Remedy Entertainment logo was
not copied from the LucasArts logo."

It's true that both logos have an eye, but beyond that aspect they are
entirely different.  I can assure all that Remedy did not purposely
incorporate an eye in their logo to copy the LucasArts logo--the fine artists
at Remedy are a little more creative than that!  I'd say that the only people
who are confused by these two logos are none other than LucasArts' attorneys. 
I'll bet the rest of the gaming community has no trouble telling them apart.

Mr. Sullivan than asks Remedy to stop using the logo:  "Accordingly, we ask
that you conform no later than July 17, 1998 that plans to use the Remedy
Entertainment logo have been abandoned and that another logo, which does not
resemble the LucasArts logo, will be used instead."

Remedy has decided to change their logo ASAP, but not all due to legal
pressure from LucasArts.  Previous to this legal threat from LucasArts, Remedy
had concluded that their logo looks like utter crap, and they had been working
on a new design that better incorporates their company's name (much like the
Apogee and 3D Realms' logos do), which should be ready in a few weeks.

I'm quite bothered by this tough stance taken by LucasArts, and I just want to
warn other developers not to include an eye in their logo!  May the Force
leave you alone...  ; )

July 8, 1998

A few people have reminded me that many months ago I said that I'd write about
the negative effects that realistic and improved graphics have had on the game
industry.  I guess it's time to pontificate.  Who knows, I might even have a
valid point or two--sometimes I get lucky that way.

Let's get this straight:  Everyone loves the improved graphics we're seeing in
today's games.  The key problem is that too often developers focus on graphics
and lose focus gameplay issues.

This is why most FMV (full motion video) games fell flat on their pompous
faces.  This is why the convergence of Hollywood and Silicon Valley won't
revolutionize the game industry.  This is why Rocket Science never had a
chance.

Spin the date dial back to the late 70's and early 80's, when graphics were
1-bit, we're talking black and white, but included masterworks like Asteroids,
Space Invaders, Space War, Battlezone, and Pong.  Other 1-bit games used
colored plastic overlays on the monitor itself, like Star Castle, Armor
Attack, and Warlords, and on some machines those overlays even lined up
correctly.

But you know what, as unrealistic as those graphics were, those games were
addictively fun.  Later games like Pac Man, Galaxian, Missile Command,
Tempest, Defender, and Centipede graduated to 2-bit (4 color), and even 4-bit
(16 color) graphics.  But still, the graphics weren't the selling point--it
was still the balanced, polished gameplay.  Designers back then for the most
part designed their games with gameplay in mind first, and the graphics were
simply a medium to bring their game to life.  Look how these older games have
been fondly remembered over the years.  There's a single, solid reason for
that:  Gameplay.

Nowadays, with graphics standards escalating on nearly a monthly basis, it's
tough for developers to focus long and hard on the juicy meat of game design. 
Imagine what the game chess might be like if the game designers had focused
too much attention on the quality of the wooden or stone pieces, and the
detail and shape of the pieces (polygon count?).  I can't imagine that these
were important considerations when the game of chess evolved, meaning chess'
gameplay (game rules and the interaction of the pieces) mattered most and
could be polished without competing distractions.

However, game players like to see something that looks better than they've
seen before.  That's what puts the pressure on developers to focus on better
graphics, and that deducts time from gameplay balance and polishing.

Perhaps the real enemy of gameplay is advancing technology, such as faster
CPUs and new 3D accelerated cards.  If we could freeze hardware technology for
five years, then all developers could stop competing so hard on the graphics
front and once again give due attention to gameplay concerns.  We might even
have more time to think of a few more original games, since we wouldn't have
the crutch of just doing what's been done before but with a better grap
