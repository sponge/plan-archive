========================================
June 5, 1997

Digging through my library of computer books I've kept for
the past 20 years, I came across Dvorak's Guide to PC
Telecommunications, released in 1990 (over 1050 pages long).
There's a chapter on shareware, which contains this text:
"Shareware is not a good plan for all programs...As a rule,
the following genres of shareware programs haven't been
clearly successful:  Games, Utilities & Vertical programs."

For games specifically, Dvorak comments:  "Game players
tire of the game and decide not to register.  Some see
games as trivial--something to play with, but certainly
not to pay for.  Younger game users just don't have the
money to pay for games."

A visionary Dvorak was not!  ;)

However, in all fairness, games did do poorly when
released as shareware up until Apogee showed the world
how to do it properly with our breakthrough technique
of releasing a portion of a full games as shareware,
and selling the remaining episodes direct.  Up until
that point all shareware authors made the mistake of
releasing their *entire game* as shareware, which
leaves little to no incentive for players to pay up.

It wasn't until Apogee's Kingdom of Kroz in 1987,
and our later games in 1990 and beyond, that an
effective way for games to make money in shareware was
discovered.  Epic Megagames was the first company to
copy the "Apogee Model" in 1992 with their Jill of the
Jungle game, and id followed suit after departing from
Apogee and releasing DOOM late in 1993.

Before the Apogee Model, authors like Nels Anderson
(Super Fly, EGA Trek, many others) and Mike Denio
(Captain Comic) released their full games as shareware
and made very little money from honest players who
sent in the game's requested registration.

It was the Apogee Model that made shareware games
profitable, and without this model I doubt that
any major game would be released as shareware nowadays.

Movie shorts:

Lost World:  Great eye candy, but just as poorly done
as ID4.  The professor's daughter was only in the movie
to be scared?!  Great role...not.  First 20 minutes a
big bore.  Why was the T-rex in the hold of the ship
when it crashed?!  Lots of other stupid stuff.

Break Down:  The first rule of when you finally have
the bad guys at gun point is to ***shoot them!***
Otherwise they always escape to come back to get you.
Other than this aggravation, a very good movie.

Warriors of Virtue:  (Had to take my son.)  Fell
asleep after finishing my popcorn with oil (I
refuse to call it butter).  Not for adults.

Ransom:  (On video)  Better than I thought.  The
father did all the right things against the FBI's
recommendation.  Good twist near the end.

Just hired another programmer for Prey, who will primarily
handle AI and other general game programming.  We'll have
more details about this person soon.  The Prey team has
nine full-timers now.  We'll be looking for another level
designer to add to the team soon after E3.

Our Portal Technology in Prey is utterly unbelievable to
see.  It is so powerful it can fry your thought process
just looking at it.  This is truly the future of 3D gaming
technology.  Prey can do tricks that defy reality.
(Whoops, maybe I'm hyping a bit too much. )

We're looking for a low-level, hardcore programmer to add
to the Duke Nukem Forever team.  Anyone interested?  ;)

The Shadow Warrior books (a two-book set) are being written
as I type.  I've been told the writers are currently
nominated for Hugo and Nebula awards, so we're expecting
these books to be of very high quality and content.

There'll be 10 of us heading to E3.  Apogee/3D Realms will
have a larger section of GT Interactive's (our retail
publisher) than any other developer GTI works with.  Plus
we'll have a back room invitation-only area for demo'ing
Prey and Duke Forever.

Paul Steed, the newest artist at id, visited us yesterday
and saw a little demo of Prey (not our Portal Technology,
though, which was broke at the time).  He noted that the
screen shots don't do the game justice (they never do).

The Prey project is moving along very swiftly and with
amazing results.  We have an amazingly talented, dedicated
and focused team, and they're all doing above-and-beyond
work.  The UK version of PC Gamer arrived yesterday and
had a major news item on Duke Nukem Forever.  There's a
paragraph about Prey in there, that reads:

"3D Realms are, of course, working on their next
generation Prey engine, but as Prey slips to late 1998, the
need for a stop-gap is obvious.  [Speaking about Duke 4.]
We were granted a furtive glance at Prey on a recent visit
to Texas and it looks so good it should be worshipped as
a god.  it uses coloured [that's how they spell it] lighting
to phenomenal effect and pixellation has been eradicated
almost as effectively as smallpox."

For Duke Nukem Forever, which will use Quake technology,
PC Gamers said:  "This is the news that almost caused us
to put this latest, scoop-packed issue on hold as it
arrived on deadline day...On the one side there is the
innovative interactivity of Duke Nukem, and countering it
are the breathtaking 3D effects only found in Quake.  Those
with vision dream of a time when all these elements can be
united in one fantastic, universal game--A kind of Theory
of Everything for 3D first-person-perspective games.  3D
Realms' licensing of Id's Quake II engine makes this dream
a stark, frothing reality."

I guess the pressure is on us to pull this off.  :)

We recently hired a superior artist, who will soon join the
Duke 4 team.  Ruben should be here the first week of June.
We get an average of 40 artist submissions per month, so we
have the luxury of picking from the best of the best.  Ruben
is truly one of the best.

The current issue of GameFan has both Duke and The Quake Guy,
guns blaring, on their cover.  This cover may become a
collectors item 10 or 20 years in the future, as representing
two of the most successful games in computer history.  We've
bought at least 25 for ourselves.

Shadow Warrior pre-orders are taking off in a huge way.  We
promise that customers pre-ordering will get their game
first.

Finally, we have an unannounced game that has been underway
for some six months now that is looking spectacular.  This
game is being developed by a developer partner in Europe,
and uses a 3D engine that's as good as the best I've seen.
Soon after E3 we'll create a web page for this game and
begin showing screen shots.

Apogee Software is 10 years old.

I started this company in 1987 with the release of two
text adventure games (like the popular Infocom games of
that era), titled Beyond the Titanic and Supernova.  I
released these games as shareware, and they bombed.  These
were two very good games so I knew the problem wasn't with
their lack of quality, so when it came time for me to
release my next game as shareware I took a different
approach.

I had three games, Kingdom of Kroz, Caverns of Kroz and
Dungeons of Kroz, all of which had previously been seen
on I.B.Magazette and Softdisk (two popular monthly disk
based magazines back then).  The rights came back to me
one year after publication, so I was trying to make more
money with these already written games.  My first foray
into the shareware market proved that players do not pay
for something they already have, so I decided to try a new
approach to shareware marketing.

I released just one Kroz game (Kingdom) and that episode
in the series advertised and promoted the other two, which
I did not release as shareware.

Bingo!  Players who liked Kingdom and wanted more had to pay,
and they did.  For almost two years those Kroz games pulled
in over $1000 a week, often up to $2000 a week.

I had invented the multi-episode method of selling games
via shareware.  Before this time, many industry pundits,
such as John Dvorak and many top figures in the shareware
industry, claimed that it wasn't possible for games to make
money in shareware, and that you needed a serious program
like a word processor or a spread sheet to be successful.
(I still have the magazine articles in which their quotes
appear.)

Nowadays, games dominate shareware, and the ones that do so
all use the marketing method Apogee pioneered 10 years ago.

If it weren't for this multi-episode method of marketing
shareware games (called the "Apogee model" by those in the
shareware industry), we might not have seen many of the
games that now appear on top ten lists.

In 1995, Apogee won an "Special Recognition Award," given
by the Shareware Industry Foundation, for pioneering this
and several other marketing methods that have aided the
industry's success over the years.

Soon I'll tell the story of how Apogee was responsible
for getting id Software involved with shareware, and how
at first they were not at all convinced that releasing a
game as shareware could make significant money.  ;)

Cool news:  Pocket Books has agreed to write and publish
four books, two based on Lo Wang, star of Shadow Warrior,
and two based on Duke Nukem.  The Shadow Warrior books
are being written first.  The Duke books will be written
and released hopefully timed with the release of Duke
Nukem Forever.

These books will *NOT* be rehashes of the stories and
events taking place in our games--they will be all-new
stories that continue the adventures of these two
characters.

Prey News:  The June issue of Computer Gaming World has
an article on Prey (pg. 78) with two older screen shots
(remember, mags have a 6-8 week lead time) that are not
nearly as nice as our newer stuff, which can be seen on
our web site now.

Today Matt Wood started work on Prey as a mapper (level
designer), and is Prey's first full timer in this
position, so hopefully we'll start to see some decent
levels soon (sorry Paul ).

Ecco Pro is awesome for managing project and task
lists.  I just wish it had a speel checkar.

Shadow Warrior's Rabbit-Sim is one of the funniest things
in gaming history.  Can't say no more.  :)

Yesterday everyone from Rogue Entertainment dropped by
to chat, which was a nice surprise.  Rogue, as many of
you know, came in to being after Scott Host left the
team.  When Scott Host was there they called themselves
Cygnus Studios, and were responsible for the popular
scrolling shooter, Raptor.

Rogue went on to make Strife, using the DOOM engine,
and they released released The Quake Mission #2
through Activision.  Now they're working on a full
blown Quake engine game.

George and I spoke with them on Quake stuff for a
while then we showed them a Prey demo and a few of
the levels from Shadow Warrior.

We'll probably make a visit to Rogue soon after
Shadow Warrior is wrapped up.

I want to thank Rogue for bringing us a copy of
their Quake pack and an oversized and very cool
version of the box.  Maybe we can get GTIS to
make something this cool for our future games.

I wish Rogue the best of luck and success.  They're
great guys and deserve it.

Just wrote another press release that's being posted
today on our web site, about Duke 3D winning a bunch
of awards at the Computer Game Developers Convention,
including Best Action Game (for the second year in
a row).

========================================
April 28, 1997

And so it begins, my first finger update...

Today is a Big News day, with the announcement that
Duke Nukem Forever will use id Software's Quake
technology.  This news leaked a few days ago and the
big question posed so far online is why aren't we
using our Prey technology.  We answered this with
a press release on www.3drealms.com, currently News
item #2.

The short answer is that if we had used the Prey
engine we would have to delay Duke 4's release
because the Prey engine is still a work-in-progress.
Inevitably, both Duke 4 and Prey would end up
coming out very close to each other and that's not a
good thing for the best success of each of those
games.

Plus, we want Prey to be the flagship game to use our
Prey technology--makes sense I hope.

We carefully reviewed the Unreal engine, too, which
is a stunning engine, but the decision for us came
down to the fact that the Quake technology was done
and user tested, allowing us to get Duke 4 out much
sooner than if we had gone with the Unreal engine.
And now that Quake will support colored lighting, the
gap between these two engines has closed
significantly.

I want to thank Tim Sweeney, Mark Rein and Jay
Wilbur for visiting us at a moment's notice and
presenting us a deal that was very hard to pass up.
Players have a lot to look forward to with Unreal.

With Prey and Duke 4 heavily in development, we've
got a lot to be excited about around here.  But the
game of the moment for us is Shadow Warrior, which I
believe is really going to surprise people in a few
we
