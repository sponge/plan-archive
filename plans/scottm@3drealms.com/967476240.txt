Got a fun email this weekend, quoted below, as received, in full:


Unfortunately this is not a Duke fan letter from a young person...am 70
years old,cutting my eye teeth on the big comp with vac tubes back in early
50's in Boston!

now am retired,a hermit,backwoods of Mississippi...with several home-built
comps and a few bucks from beta testing that helps out the lousey Soc Sec
check!

Thanks to Duke,I enjoy the game's high,high quality and detail in the
visuals..and the never-ending array of ideas and secrets that have been
provided!

Once a week I travel north to Memphis,Tn to the VA hospital to make sure I
will last another month of two.
Since my hovel in the woods can not get cable or dish tv
(because of the wonderful abundance of trees!) whenever I can watch CNN etc,
I do!

However this morning was a bummer...Cnn showed some Duke clips as a teaser
to an upcoming news item!

Natch,I waited for more..only to find the Great Guy was used by CNN as an
example of violence in comp games for kids etc.  What a bunch of CRAP!

I am sorry so many youngsters growing up will now shy away from the Duke's
exploits...damn shame.

Someday I hope to be able to afford ALL the Duke's games as I only have
Duke 1,2 and 3D.  Perhaps even get the Build Engine and learn all about it.

Sincerely I give thanks to the brains and crafts that created DUKE
NUKEM....thanks....M.Oi  moi

Non-gaming info -- Just being a proud Dad!

This school year my 9-yr-old son, Shane, was accepted into Watson Technology Center 
(starting 4th grade after exceling his three previous grade years in another school), a magnet 
elementary school that emphasizes math, science and technology, as well as real world team 
cooperation.  His mom, Chana, and I couldn't be happier or more proud of Shane.

And it gets better because my second boy, Jace, who's starting kindergarten, also gets to go 
to this school, a benefit of having a very smart older brother.  Too good to be true.

Their mom and I are letting them pick where to eat tonight, which I'm sure will involve pizza.  :)

OMG!

My new guitar hero:  Steve Stevens

Just bought his first instrumental CD, "Flamenco.A.Go.Go", easily the most variety packed, 
exceptionally entertaining guitar-based instrument CD I've bought in a few years.  And it's all 
acoustic guitar playing, something I'm not usually as into as much as electric guitars, but this 
work is not ordinary in the least.  Not all the songs are fast paced, some are slow and 
haunting in nature, but they're all refreshingly unique and played by an stunningly masterful 
musician.

If you like guitar-based instrumental music, you will not regret getting this one, in fact it may 
become one of your all-time favorites.

A few concerns about Microsoft's coming X-Box console:

[1]  A big knock against all next-gen consoles, now that they have the graphics horse power 
to matter, is that TV screens are relatively low-resolution monitors that cannot deliver the 
clean, detailed images of a PC monitor.  Until HDTV is wide spread, this gives a BIG advantage 
to PCs.

[2]  Typically, in a given major market, only the top two brands will be highly successful, and 
I think everyone has good reason to believe Sony is a lock as one of those two.  Nintendo or 
Sega both have a very strong chance at being the other one, since both of those companies 
are solely focused on the gaming market and that gives them many business and marketing 
advantages.  Nintendo, ESPECIALLY, seems like a sure-thing because of their very strong 
gaming brands, like Zelda, Mario Bros., Donkey Kong, and PokÙ‰mon.  And even the PC itself 
must be considered a formidable game platform.

[3]  It's just not convenient or easy to use a mouse in front of a TV, so that's a big-time PC, 
and an advantage that makes games that are best played on PCs (FPS and RTS games, 
among others), often too hard to play on the X-Box as with the other consoles.

[4]  If Microsoft believes that anyone will want to use the Internet and do their email, etc. on 
a TV-based console system, they will been proven wrong.  I just don't see people putting up 
with that kind of hassle, and reading text on fuzzy TVs, and doing anything on the X-Box that 
is far better suited to a PC.  Maybe when a desk in front of TV screens become standard 
equipment, then consoles will have a prayer at becoming more than just a game machine.

[5]  I foresee that the majority of X-Box games will be enhanced ports of PC games.  This will 
be a serious problem for the X-Box's identity, because I don't see many developers making 
original content and brands for it--the majority of developers will still make games for the PC 
and then choose to port them to the X-Box.  I predict most developers who develop games 
for the PC will simply say, "Hey, let's do an X-Box version, too!"

[6]  It's hard to imagine that any hardcore PC game players will buy the X-Box.  People with 
PCs will stick with PCs because PCs are by far the better game playing machine (assuming the 
PC has a generally equal CPU and 3D graphics card, and PCs for sale when the X-Box comes 
out should easily exceed the X-Box's CPU power, and be close to equal with the 3D graphics 
card), because they easily support the mouse (you're setting at a desk!), and the monitor is 
capable of displaying text that's readable in something wider than a 50 column mode!  Also, 
the PC has many other applications, and it has a keyboard (imagine trying to play a FPS 
without a mouse and a keyboard--and think about all those keyboard shortcut keys for so 
many other games), making it the best all-in-one solution for most people.  Quite simply, few 
people with a PC, I think, will switch to the X-Box to play games when it's easier to stay put 
on the PC.  Sure, some people with older PCs may buy an X-Box to play high-end PC games, 
but I think that's a small percentage of us.  Overall, stripped down PCs that are reduced to 
game machines doesn't seem like a winning idea, because a PC is so much better, and PC 
prices are becoming much less a barrier for people who might otherwise buy a console 
machine.

In addition to these six points, I'll address a few comments I've seen in the press.  David 
Cage, CEO of Quantic Dream, is quoted as saying in the current issue of NextGen:  "[The] PC 
is probably condemned to disappear [as a game machine]...The reason is simple, you need to 
pay about five to ten times more to have a good PC than a console."  The fallacy with this 
comment is that people buy PCs to do more than play games, and they buy them for the 
complete package of things that can be done with them.  Quite simply, PCs will never be 
replaced by consoles as the preferred device to use the Internet and run other non-game 
applications--and even many game genres are better suited to PCs than consoles.

Rob Dyer, a V.P. with Eidos, says in the same article:  "I'm going way out on a limb, but I 
think the PC is going to cease to be any kind of viable platform within the next 18 to 24 
months.  It's going to be completely supplanted by Microsoft's X-Box or whatever else."  You 
have to admire a bold claim like this, but it just isn't going to happen.  PCs, due to their wide 
utility, will always be around, and always be a solid platform for game developers.  The X-Box 
will not replace the PC as a game platform, no way.

The X-Box will have near impossible time competing against the PC, PS2 and Dolphin.  And all 
four cannot succeed, the market cannot support this many successful game platforms.  
Microsoft of course has big money, so many people think that's an automatic win, but big 
money doesn't mean success, otherwise companies like Gateway, Dell and Compaq would 
have never had incredible success against IBM in the PC market. Influence and positioning are 
more important than money, and Sony and Nintendo both have far better positioning 
(Microsoft really isn't known as a game company by the general public), and both Sony and 
Nintendo have strong influence, too, probably better than Microsoft in the game channels.

The things that the X-Box will have in its favor, such as being a fixed and stable hardware 
platform, and a low price compared to PCs, may not be enough to overtake the other top 
consoles and the PC itself.  Strange as it may seem, the X-Box might have a better chance of 
being successful, IF it was not so much like the PC, inviting mostly PC ports rather than 
entirely original projects and brands.

Anyway, to paraphrase Dennis Miller, I may be proven wrong.  But I doubt it.

Just saw this:

"COMPUTER games do not prompt players to morph into anti-social, aggressive couch-
potatoes, a four-year Government-sponsored report has found...The nationwide report was 
commissioned by Federal and State Ministers with responsibility for censorship to investigate 
the extent of violence in computer and arcade games and the effect on players.  The majority 
of players feel happy, exhilarated, relaxed or challenged when playing, according to 
researchers, who witnessed 'very little overt aggression' in video arcades."

Xmas Eve, 1999

Lonely day at the office.  Since when did Christmas Eve become a non-work day? ;-)

I guess most people use today to get those last-second gifts.  This year I got practically all 
my gifts via online stores weeks ago.  For the most part things went well...

Amazon.com is easily the best place to order from online.  They make buying quicker or more
convenient than any other e-store I've used.  All of the Buy.com stores are also 
recommended.  On the other hand, www.Living.com still hasn't sent me all of my order that I 
placed mid-Nov.  Avoid that place at all costs.

www.EddieBauer.com hasn't quite figured out online commerce, either.  I placed an order with 
them and two days later they called me, leaving a voice message for me to return their call 
(without saying why).  Normally, I don't return calls like this, but luckily this time I did.  Turns 
out they were calling me to verify my address, and if I'd not called back they would not have 
shipped my order(!!!), and several of my family would have missed out on their presents.  No 
other site I've used calls back to verify the address!?  What's the point of taking advantage 
of the convenience of online ordering if you're going to be called back?  I ended up having an 
email conversation with the CEO if Eddie Bauer, and it's rather apparent she's old school and 
doesn't get It.

I ordered a few kid's toys from www.ZanyBrainy.com and after waiting two weeks for them to 
arrive, I checked my account and it looks like my order was never processed.  Maybe I should 
have e-shopped at eToys.com instead.

Finally, though not Xmas shopping related, I tried www.NetGrocier.com, ordering about $16 
worth of house supplies, and shipping came to $8!  Not only was that outrageous, but you'd 
think that NetGrocier.com would have cheaper prices (making the shipping easier to swallow)
since they do to not having actual stores, but you'd be thinking wrong.

Finally, a firm we work with sent us some cookies this week, and I've never had better 
cookies that weren't freshly home made.  Check out www.BrentAndSams.com, and specifically 
the Chocolate Chip Pecan and Key Lime/White Chocolate cookies.  You can easily order from 
this site and also send tins of these cookies (and several other varieties) as gifts.

My personal favs for 1999:

Movie:  Being John Malkovich

PC Game:  Unreal Tournament

Non-Fiction Book:  The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding

Music CD:  Jeff Beck's "Who Else!"

TV show:  X-Files.

An article about video game violence that desputes much of the
extreme preaching of Lieutenant Colonel David Grossman, who's
unfortunately become the press' favorite "expert" source.

Oct. 8, 1999

Computer Games Magazine, Nov. 1999 issue, page B26, ("10 Essential First-Person
Shooters" by Steve Bauman, Editor-at-Large).

Duke Nukem 3D is listed among a hall-of-fame list of ten 3D shooters, although I 
would have put Wolfenstein 3-D in this list ahead of Outlaws, but that's not the 
thing that needs correcting, that's just a minor blunder.

Far worse is this statement by Bauman:  "[Duke Nukem 3D's] most unfortunate legacy 
is the wise-cracking lead character (most of which was cribbed verbatim from Army 
of Darkness)..."

Hmmm, most lines taken from Army of Darkness?  Not even close.  Of the 100+ lines 
that Duke speaks in the game, there are only three, maybe four lines from AofD.  
The only three we can think of are "Hail to the king, baby," "Who wants some" and 
"Groovy."  Big whoop.  We borrowed several lines from other movies, too, but the 
vast majority of Duke-isms were created by us.  It looks like Bauman's attempt to 
blast Duke resulted in a self frag.
