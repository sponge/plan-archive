Which Dallas area development house (with at least one released game) can claim the lowest 
number of developers quitting in the past 18 months?

Answer:  Apogee (a.k.a. 3D Realms).

Which Dallas-area developers have had significant losses over that period?

Answer:  Not Apogee.  ; )

Jeepers!  Got a wildly enthusiastic response to my blathering on time quanta.  Apparently, there 
are large numbers of people interested in this topic.  I've been an avid reader and follower of 
astronomy and nuclear physics (I guess I love the extremes!) since my early teens.  A great primer 
on this topic is of course Stephen Hawkings "A Brief History of Time" (there's now a color 
illustrated version of this book that is much better than the first b/w version).  There are dozens 
of good books out now that cover the oddities of quantum physics, relativity, black holes, time 
travel, etc.  I recently read "A Beginner's Guide to Constructing the Universe:  The Mathematical 
Archetypes of Nature, Art, and Science," which was quite an eye-opener as far as how math and 
geometry are so prevalent in nature and science in ways that are not obvious (e.g. a spiral is the 
most common shape in nature, from embryos, plants, hurricanes to galaxies).  Anyway, a plan file 
is not the place to do much talking about this, but it's nice to see that so many readers of my plan 
are "into" these cool areas of science.

Played late night poker hosted by Gathering of Developers last night.  Kinda cool playing in a 
church.  About 25 local developers there.  Loads of fun, pizza, beer, and not too costly, though at 
one point I was down $200, but somehow climbed out of that hole.  Thanks Mike and crew, let's 
do again soon.  And more pizza!

Anyway...  Last weekend it occurred to me that time could not possibly be a smooth continuum, 
infinitely divisible, and that there must be quantum time.  If particles can have a minimum unit, 
why not time?  This, I argued with friends, would solve several known problems.  By stunning 
coincidence, the current issue of Science News talks about the possibility of time quanta, and it 
may be this smallest unit of time that determines the speed of light (a photon can only jump ahead 
so far given the minimum quanta of time).  If this is the case, we all live a strobed, digital life, 
leaping from one time unit to the next, rather than smoothly gliding through our existence.  For the 
curious, the Science News article estimated a time quantum at 0.3 x 10-43 (-43 power).

If anyone knows of a web site or book that discusses this further, let me know.

*  Duke Nukem movie made a big leap yesterday.  The most recent story draft is finally something 
that represents what we've been looking for.  We (Threshold and 3D Realms) have been molding 
and rewriting this thing for six months, but now we have a concept that excites us, and therefore 
we think will excite Duke fans.  Can't talk about details this early--sorry for the tease.  ; )

*  I'm still getting lots of emails from press, developers and fans talking about the idiotic doings of 
LucasArts, and their insanely petty effort to stop Remedy Entertainment (developer of Max Payne) 
from using Remedy's company logo, which incorporates an eyeball and eyelid, an element in the 
LucasArts company logo.  LucasArts attorneys have the odd opinion that no other company is 
brilliant enough to think of using an eye in their logo, and therefore every other company with an 
eye in their logo MUST be ripping of LucasArts.  (This includes at least five other game developers 
that I've previously mentioned in this space.)  Sigh--is there any wonder why we often view 
attorneys as waste matter.  No one who has written me, and I mean No One, has defended 
LucasArts--it's been 100% anti-LucasArts, and rightfully so in this case.  No one likes an
in-the-wrong big bully.  Well, I see this as a dead issue now, no need to jab a competitor who 
seems to do well jabbing themselves (in their own eye, no less).

*  In the Sept. issue of Game Developer magazine (www.gdmag.com) Warren Spector writes a 
guest column ("Soapbox") that's hits on about a dozen design points that every game developer 
should know before heading into the dangerous world of game design.  For example, a big game 
world is not necessarily an interesting game world.  And conversational branching into a deep tree 
is rarely fun (most game players end up trying every single branch anyway, just to make sure they 
haven't missed anything, and this ends up being very tedious).  After reading this piece, I have 
heightened enthusiasm for Warren's coming game, Dues Ex.  I recommend all developers give this a 
read.

*  Puzzle:  Duke and QuakeGuy were the final two contestants in a match to win Lara's hand for a 
date.  King Eidos, though, didn't like either contestant and so devised a plan:  Duke and QuakeGuy 
would each be assigned a car and enter a mile long car race in which the winner would get Lara, 
but the catch is that the winner is the *car* that comes in *last*!  Duke and QuakeGuy were 
worried that the King had outsmarted them, until Duke came up with an idea that would make the 
race fair and fast.  What was Duke's idea?  (And, btw, Duke won the race.)

From:  http://www.gamespot.co.uk/pc.gamespot/features/gurus/23.html:

Todd Porter (writing about the future of the game industry):  "Storytellers and true game designers will have 
the stage. Technology will be so advanced, that technology leaps will fade to the background. Ion Storm will 
be sued by the government for having made such great titles that other game companies complain they don't 
have a chance."

So far, I don't hear any other game companies complaining.  ; )

updated Aug. 7

Good news, there was a lot of hard disk caching with my 128k RAM, so I went ahead and upgraded 
to 128megs.  Made a big difference.  ; )

Finally got a new system:  P2-400 with Voodoo2, 128k RAM and 11gig drive.  I can finally play Sin and Unreal in realtime.  (Not a dig against these fine games, but the fact is that my old system 
couldn't handle these games without lots of hitching.)  Anyway, it's nice to be back on the leading 
edge again, even if it'll probably only last for a few months!

BitchX finally publicly revealed.  She's someone we used to work with and had a great business 
relationship with.  I hope this isn't the end to her game gossip site.

Video Game Patent Fight News:  Still ongoing and still costing us 10's of $1000's to fight.  It's clear 
that we're not violating it, but the Bad Guys (patent holders) don't know when they're beat, and 
won't give up.  Sheesh.  It's too bad the SPA doesn't have the balls to help us out.

Max Payne milestone #10 came in this week.  Much cool stuff.  Things are reaching a "game" stage, 
and fast progress should ensue.

Puzzle:  You're in a car in the northern part of the Artic, with the car pointing due north on an 
ordinary but straight paved road.  You drive for exactly one mile, without turning, and end up one 
mile south of where you started.  How?

Sequels:  The Lame Name Game

Advice to publishers and developers of sequels:  Stop using the ultimate lame
name device:  sequel numbers.

3D Realms will never have a game title like Duke Nukem 4, Max Payne 2 or Prey
2.  We think those "sequel numbers" that follow a game's title are both
uncreative and lame.  Many movie sequels have equally lame titles, like the
Lethal Weapon sequels, the Godfather sequels and the Rocky sequels.

As an alternative, look at movie sequels that avoid using the lameness of
sequel numbers.  The Star Wars sequels, thank George, are not named Star Wars 2
and Star Wars 3.  Same with the Indiana Jones sequels, each having its own
original name, making each movie seem more like an episode in a TV series. 
George Lucas has figured out the sequel name game.

The Batman sequels, the Alien sequels, and the James Bond series also rely on
each movie having its own unique name, rather than simply attaching a lame
sequel number.  But some sequels try to have it both ways, going with a sequel
number and a new subtitle, like Speed 2:  Cruise Control, but this doesn't
work--the lameness of the sequel number is still there, plus the name is way
too long.  Why not just name the movie Cruise Control and lose the Speed
reference?   (E.g.  The sequel to Jurassic Park wasn't Jurassic Park 2: The
Lost World, it was simply The Lost World.  Lameness avoided!)

From a marketing standpoint, sequel numbers seem like a good idea, because they
build upon the awareness and equity built into the original title, but in the
long run they are detrimental because they look like rehashes of the original
product, rather than stand alone original works on their own.

Tomb Raider 2 and Tomb Raider 3 are both extremely lame titles.  If Eidos had
as much guts as their star character they'd have instead followed the Indiana
Jones model for their game titles:  Raiders of the Lost Ark is equivalent to
the first Tomb Raider title, in that in neither one is the starring character's
name used.  But in the next two movies Lucas wisely emphasized Harrison Ford's
character in the titles (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana
Jones and the Final Crusade).  The second and third Lara Croft games should
have followed this same model, with names like Lara Croft and the Lost City (or
whatever is appropriate to the each game's story).

The continued use of the Tomb Raider name in the sequels is lame in another
respect, too, because it forces each game to take place in a tomb location
every game, otherwise the title doesn't make sense.  Eidos is really missing
the boat by not emphasizing the Lara Croft character in their game titles, and
freeing up the versatility of the game's locations.

At 3D Realms, we don't even view games as sequels, we think of them as new
episodes in an on-going TV series.  Who thinks of each TV episode as a sequel
to the previous episode?  No one.  We apply the same thinking to our games and
our game titles, and so you'll never see a game named Duke Nukem 4, just like
an episode of X-Files isn't titled X-Files 117.

Here are more lame examples of sequel numbered games:

Warlords III:  Darklords Rising -- Why not simply Darklords Rising?

Blood 2:  The Chosen -- Why not just The Chosen?  Is connecting this game to
Blood really that beneficial!?  Look at DreamWorks' game, Trespasser, which
thankfully avoided the lame alternative, The Lost World: Trespasser--someone
had the smarts to realize they didn't need to blatantly attach "The Lost World"
brand to this game's title.

Might and Magic VI:  The Mandate of Heaven -- Why not just The Mandate of
Heaven and somewhere on the box have a Might and Magic logo, like James Bond
has the 007 logo?

Jazz Jackrabbit 2 -- I would have gone with the title Jazz and Spaz instead,
since both characters are emphasized heavily in this game and on the box front.

KKND2:  Krossfire -- Why not just Krossfire?  And if that's trademarked
already, then think of something else as klever.

Need for Speed III:  Hot Pursuit -- Should just be Hot Pursuit with a Need for
Speed logo somewhere on the box front.

Descent:  Freespace:  The Great War -- No sequel number, but this name is just
out of control!  And why it's attached to the Descent series I can't figure
out, what are we descending into?

To be fair, Apogee has had one lame sequel name, Duke Nukem 2 in 1993, but
since that time we got a clue.  Better late than never.

News Bulletin:  Developers Beware!

It seems the attorneys at LucasArts think that the Remedy Entertainment
company logo (can be viewed here: http://www.maxpayne.com/) is too similar to
the LucasArts logo.

FYI, Remedy Entertainment is working with 3D Realms to develop the PC game Max
Payne, which recently garnered a great deal of positive feedback from the
recent showing at the Gathering of Developers' E3 booth.

A letter (dated July 9) from LucasArts' attorney, John Sullivan, of Fenwick
and West LLP, claimed:  "The Remedy Entertainment logo so closely resembles
the top portion of the LucasArts logo, which, like the Remedy Entertainment
logo, forms an eye, that, considering LucasArts' prominence in the computer
game industry, it is hard to believe that the Remedy Entertainment logo was
not copied from the LucasArts logo."

It's true that both logos have an eye, but beyond that aspect they are
entirely different.  I can assure all that Remedy did not purposely
incorporate an eye in their logo to copy the LucasArts logo--the fine artists
at Remedy are a little more creative than that!  I'd say that the only people
who are confused by these two logos are none other than LucasArts' attorneys. 
I'll bet the rest of the gaming community has no trouble telling them apart.

Mr. Sullivan than asks Remedy to stop using the logo:  "Accordingly, we ask
that you conform no later than July 17, 1998 that plans to use the Remedy
Entertainment logo have been abandoned and that another logo, which does not
resemble the LucasArts
