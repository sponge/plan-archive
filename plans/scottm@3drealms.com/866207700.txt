* Go get 'em guys.  Loved the Open Letter to Microsloth,
stating that MS needs to further support OpenGL for game
developers as well as they support DirectsuX.  (Golly, can
I be any more mean to MS?  I shouldn't be--they're really
good guys, just misdirected sometimes.)  The signatures on
this letter read like a Who's Who of the members of GameTech,
so these are truly the best people to get MS to change their
ways.

* Yesterday Apogee was part of a star-studded group of
initial inductees in the newly established Shareware Hall of
Fame, founded by the Shareware Industry Awards Foundation.
In all, there are 52 inductees, consisting of authors and
companies that made a significant contribution to the world of
shareware.  Said the press release:  "Many of the inductees
have provided an invaluable contribution to both the shareware
industry and the global computer market, including Eudora,
Apogee Software and PKWare."

Apogee and id Software are the only two game companies
inducted.  Other notable inductees include Bob Wallace,
Jim Button (the two pioneers of shareware, back in 1982),
and Marshall Magee, another early shareware pioneer who
wrote Automenu and was the first President of the
Association of Shareware Professionals.

More information is at www.sic.org.

* Still no luck finding a new name to replace Apogee.
Rambo Studios is the current leader on our list.  :)

* Got the DOOM Music CD from good friend Bobby Prince
yesterday.  It's fantastic, chilling and highly recommended!
70 minutes worth of the best DOOM music remastered and
made better in most songs.  Visit www.bpmusic.com for details
on ordering this.  My copy is autographed:  "To Scott, the man
who got me started! -- Bobby."  Bobby has created the music
for at least ten of our games, including Duke 3D, Keen,
Wolf 3D, ROTT, Xenophage, Duke II and Cosmo.  For being a
retired attorney, he's a decent guy and a heck of an artist. ;)

* Looks like we forgot to check our Apogee trademark and
someone else owns it.  Drats.  We're thinking of new names:
Rogue, nope--taken.  Raven, nope--taken.  Ritual, nope--taken.
Better stay away from names starting with "R"--it's getting a
bit crowded and confusing in that arena.  ;)  Actually, it's
too bad Hipnotic wasn't available for them--it's a much better
name than Ritual because of all of the word-play potential,
with "Hipsters," "our games hypnotize you," etc.  Still, a
quality name is not nearly as important as a quality game,
and I'm sure there they'll do well, especially with all the
Duke talent they have.    (Just kidding, sheesh.)

* We were recently notified by PC World magazine that Duke
Nukem 3D won "Best Game of 1996."  Another award, yawn.

* Been playing the work-in-progress for the N64 Duke 3D,
and the explosion effects rival those in Turok.  Very
cool stuff.  Also, we're redoing some of the weapons
altogether, taking advantage of the N64's abilities.

* Finally, Altec Lansing, as cool a company as you're going
to find, just delivered to us a truck load of high-end
computer speakers.  These speakers are black, which fit
nicely with our new charcoal/black desks we recently
bought for everyone here.  We have speaker companies trying
to give us free stuff all the time, but Altec's stuff is
what everyone here uses.  (That's an endorsement for those
who have trouble reading between the lines. ;)

Going through more older books (deciding which get kept or
tossed) and found the 1985 Programmer's Market, a book I used
to help me find publishers to sell my games to when I was
first entering the business.  I think this book is still
updated yearly and sold, btw.

Anyway, here are some of the developers and publishers from
back then I notice are not still around:  Avante-Guard,
Big Five (Miner '49er), CBS Software, Datamost, Epyx
(Jumpman, Impossible Mission), MicroLab, MicroSpec (Trek-64),
Muse Software (Castle Wolfenstein), Quality Software,
Penguin Software, Sirius.  I'm sure there are dozens and
dozens of others.

Also, Ken Williams, CEO of Sierra, had this to say:  "I see
lots of programs that use three-dimensional scrolling
terrains.  It's a cute effect, but some much of the machine's
power goes into moving the landscape that the game suffers.
Graphics are important, but secondary to gameplay."  This was
quite true for back then, but then FMV came along and gameplay
became less than secondary, it became a tack-on at the end.

Duke Nukem just keeps selling and selling and selling...  Our
1st quarter 1997 royalty check from GTIS was huge, and GTIS
told us they've already sold more in that Q than they were
expecting to sell all year.  Also, in Europe Duke won't die.
In the weekly sales charts I get from Europe, Duke Atomic
continues to stay in the Top Ten, this week rising from
spot 10 to 9.  (By comparison, Quake, which came out five
months after Duke, has been below Duke for months, currently
at spot 18.  BTW, this isn't meant to be a put down of Quake,
I'm using it just as a good reference.)  As they say in the
business, Duke has legs.

In our offices Carmageddon seems to be the game of the week.
It's the kind of game we wish we would have time to make
here.  ;)

E3 is just around the corner!  If our plane goes down this
company is a goner...  

Con Air:  We've seen all the predictable explosive effects
before, but the fun characters make this one a winner.  Why
do we cheer for the escaped psycho-lunitic-killer at the end?
Why ask why?  ;)

Ghost and the Darkness (on video):  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!

Frank Zappa, "Guitars" (compilation of best guitar solos up
to the mid-80's, no singing):  Great, great stuff!  Two
CD's of very creative, diverse instrumental mastery.  What
I like about Zappa's music is that he always worked with
very, very talented musicians, such as Steve Vai and Terry
Bozzio.

Digging through my library of computer books I've kept for
the past 20 years, I came across Dvorak's Guide to PC
Telecommunications, released in 1990 (over 1050 pages long).
There's a chapter on shareware, which contains this text:
"Shareware is not a good plan for all programs...As a rule,
the following genres of shareware programs haven't been
clearly successful:  Games, Utilities & Vertical programs."

For games specifically, Dvorak comments:  "Game players
tire of the game and decide not to register.  Some see
games as trivial--something to play with, but certainly
not to pay for.  Younger game users just don't have the
money to pay for games."

A visionary Dvorak was not!  ;)

However, in all fairness, games did do poorly when
released as shareware up until Apogee showed the world
how to do it properly with our breakthrough technique
of releasing a portion of a full games as shareware,
and selling the remaining episodes direct.  Up until
that point all shareware authors made the mistake of
releasing their *entire game* as shareware, which
leaves little to no incentive for players to pay up.

It wasn't until Apogee's Kingdom of Kroz in 1987,
and our later games in 1990 and beyond, that an
effective way for games to make money in shareware was
discovered.  Epic Megagames was the first company to
copy the "Apogee Model" in 1992 with their Jill of the
Jungle game, and id followed suit after departing from
Apogee and releasing DOOM late in 1993.

Before the Apogee Model, authors like Nels Anderson
(Super Fly, EGA Trek, many others) and Mike Denio
(Captain Comic) released their full games as shareware
and made very little money from honest players who
sent in the game's requested registration.

It was the Apogee Model that made shareware games
profitable, and without this model I doubt that
any major game would be released as shareware nowadays.

Movie shorts:

Lost World:  Great eye candy, but just as poorly done
as ID4.  The professor's daughter was only in the movie
to be scared?!  Great role...not.  First 20 minutes a
big bore.  Why was the T-rex in the hold of the ship
when it crashed?!  Lots of other stupid stuff.

Break Down:  The first rule of when you finally have
the bad guys at gun point is to ***shoot them!***
Otherwise they always escape to come back to get you.
Other than this aggravation, a very good movie.

Warriors of Virtue:  (Had to take my son.)  Fell
asleep after finishing my popcorn with oil (I
refuse to call it butter).  Not for adults.

Ransom:  (On video)  Better than I thought.  The
father did all the right things against the FBI's
recommendation.  Good twist near the end.

Just hired another programmer for Prey, who will primarily
handle AI and other general game programming.  We'll have
more details about this person soon.  The Prey team has
nine full-timers now.  We'll be looking for another level
designer to add to the team soon after E3.

Our Portal Technology in Prey is utterly unbelievable to
see.  It is so powerful it can fry your thought process
just looking at it.  This is truly the future of 3D gaming
technology.  Prey can do tricks that defy reality.
(Whoops, maybe I'm hyping a bit too much. )

We're looking for a low-level, hardcore programmer to add
to the Duke Nukem Forever team.  Anyone interested?  ;)

The Shadow Warrior books (a two-book set) are being written
as I type.  I've been told the writers are currently
nominated for Hugo and Nebula awards, so we're expecting
these books to be of very high quality and content.

There'll be 10 of us heading to E3.  Apogee/3D Realms will
have a larger section of GT Interactive's (our retail
publisher) than any other developer GTI works with.  Plus
we'll have a back room invitation-only area for demo'ing
Prey and Duke Forever.

Paul Steed, the newest artist at id, visited us yesterday
and saw a little demo of Prey (not our Portal Technology,
though, which was broke at the time).  He noted that the
screen shots don't do the game justice (they never do).

========================================

The Prey project is moving along very swiftly and with
amazing results.  We have an amazingly talented, dedicated
and focused team, and they're all doing above-and-beyond
work.  The UK version of PC Gamer arrived yesterday and
had a major news item on Duke Nukem Forever.  There's a
paragraph about Prey in there, that reads:

"3D Realms are, of course, working on their next
generation Prey engine, but as Prey slips to late 1998, the
need for a stop-gap is obvious.  [Speaking about Duke 4.]
We were granted a furtive glance at Prey on a recent visit
to Texas and it looks so good it should be worshipped as
a god.  it uses coloured [that's how they spell it] lighting
to phenomenal effect and pixellation has been eradicated
almost as effectively as smallpox."

For Duke Nukem Forever, which will use Quake technology,
PC Gamers said:  "This is the news that almost caused us
to put this latest, scoop-packed issue on hold as it
arrived on deadline day...On the one side there is the
innovative interactivity of Duke Nukem, and countering it
are the breathtaking 3D effects only found in Quake.  Those
with vision dream of a time when all these elements can be
united in one fantastic, universal game--A kind of Theory
of Everything for 3D first-person-perspective games.  3D
Realms' licensing of Id's Quake II engine makes this dream
a stark, frothing reality."

I guess the pressure is on us to pull this off.  :)

We recently hired a superior artist, who will soon join the
Duke 4 team.  Ruben should be here the first week of June.
We get an average of 40 artist submissions per month, so we
have the luxury of picking from the best of the best.  Ruben
is truly one of the best.

The current issue of GameFan has both Duke and The Quake Guy,
guns blaring, on their cover.  This cover may become a
collectors item 10 or 20 years in the future, as representing
two of the most successful games in computer history.  We've
bought at least 25 for ourselves.

Shadow Warrior pre-orders are taking off in a huge way.  We
promise that customers pre-ordering will get their game
first.

Finally, we have an unannounced game that has been underway
for some six months now that is looking spectacular.  This
game is being developed by a developer partner in Europe,
and uses a 3D engine that's as good as the best I've seen.
Soon after E3 we'll create a web page for this game and
begin showing screen shots.

Apogee Software is 10 years old.

I started this company in 1987 with the release of two
text adventure games (like the popular Infocom games of
that era), titled Beyond the Titanic and Supernova.  I
released these games as shareware, and they bombed.  These
were two very good games so I knew the problem wasn't with
their lack of quality, so when it came time for me to
release my next game as shareware I took a different
approach.

I had three games, Kingdom of Kroz, Caverns of Kroz and
Dungeons of Kroz, all of which had previously
