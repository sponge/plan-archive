*  Our publisher, GTIS, tells us that we can expect Shadow Warrior to get at
least another 30,000 sales thanks to all of the extra controversy this game
has gotten.

*  Cowboys play the Cardinals tonight.  Feathers will fly:  31-13.

*  Congratulations to Ion Storm for getting top game designer Warren Spector
on their team.  Ultima Underworld was a breakthrough game (why did they stop
at two UUs?).  Also, I saw Warren talk about Looking Glass' The Dark Project
at E3, and I was impressed with that game's outside-the-box innovations and
design.  Can't wait to see what his new project will be.

*  On my top ten games list I forgot one of my all-time favorite games,
Xevious, which would be around 7 on my list.  A digital ton of people have
written me agreeing that Forgotten Worlds was an awesome game.  I'm still
looking for an arcade machine version (not a console version) of this game.
Apparently there weren't many made.

*  Adrenaline Vault (www.avault.com) has a good feature on larger, corporate
companies/publishers buying smaller developers.  Todd Hollenshead, Mike
Wilson and myself all contributed to this article.  I think this article was
based off a finger update I wrote the day I heard that Activision bought
Raven, since it basically mirrors what I originally wrote, but is greatly
elaborated upon.  What I said in my August 7th plan was that the developer
being bought typically loses key people.  At this point, Raven has had two
developers leave to join Apogee (3D Realms div.), and at least eight more
have left (or are soon to leave) to form their own development company.

My comments on Mario 64 and Miyamoto has elicited a flood of great responses,
with people giving me all sorts of lists.  So, for the record, here's *my*
list of the 10 all-time greatest arcade, console or PC games:

[1]  Forgotten Worlds -- What?  Never heard of it?  I only saw this game at
one location, a Putt-Putt in Mesquite, TX, in 1988.  It was a one- or two-player
game in which you controlled a male hero-type who started with meek weapons but
could build up an arsenal of incredible weapons by killing bad guys, collecting
"zennies," and using the zennies to buy better stuff in shops between levels
(and some shops hidden in levels).

The variety of this games scrolling scenarios has yet to be matched in a
scrolling action game.  Plus, you could choose different paths at certain
spots, adding to the game's replayability.  Most of all, this was one of the
last *fair* games of it's type, allowing a master player to finish it on one
quarter, which took about 25 minutes to reach the incredible ending.

I can't describe well enough all the details, variety, cool enemies, and
options in this game that make it number one on my list.  If anyone knows
where I can buy one of these please let me know.

[2]  Asteroids -- Simple, relentless, innovative and tough to master.  My
longest game was about five hours and I quit with dozens of ships.  George
played a 20+ hour game, trying to beat the world's record (40+ hours), but
got too tired to continue.

[3]  Tempest -- Truly innovated and addictive.  My best score was over
800,000--I was able to reach the final "white" levels on one quarter, but I
was the manager of an arcade during the early to mid-eighties, and got to
play all these games for free.

[4]  M.U.L.E. -- My first multiplayer game, and one I won a lot of money on.  ;)

[5]  Planetfall -- The first game that evoked sadness, because of Floyd's
sacrifice.  Never will a graphics adventure invoke better images than a text
adventure--it's not even a fair battle.  This and other Infocom titles inspired
me to write two text adventures of  my own:  Beyond the Titanic (1986) and
Supernova (1987).

[6]  Jumpman (and Jumpman Jr.) -- I loved the puzzles along with the action.
Plus, each level added something wildly new and surprising.

[7]  Missile Command -- I got so good at this game I would play without
losing a city up until the point when the game would overload, which
happened around the score of 825,000, at which point it'd give you 256 bonus
cities, so higher scores were bogus.

[8]  Rogue -- The game that inspired my seven Kroz games, which started Apogee.

[9]  Ultima 3 -- This was the final Ultima before the series got too involved.

[10] Donkey Kong -- Stupid name but incredible, innovative game.  The first
arcade game to use hardware sprites, I believe, too.

Other top games include Space Invaders, Battlezone, Defender, Robotron,
Space Duel, Enchanter, Space Quest 3, Rick Dangerous and Archon (original).

Having lived in the Dallas area since 1978, I'm a certified Cowboys fan.
I'll have a little fun each Friday predicting the coming Cowboys game.  This
week we battle the Steelers.  Prediction:  Cowboys melt steel 30 - 17.

BTW, I predict Cowboys against Denver (maybe Steelers) in the Superbowl,
unless key injuries occur, of course.

Got this email message today:  "As far as Johnny Wilson [editor of CGW] goes,
I have seen numerous articles about flight sticks in his magazine and in every
one of them,  the directional control is referred to as a 'coolie hat.'  Will
he take the matter up with his sim jocks, or is it only offensive in certain
contexts?"

Interesting point.

George Broussard, my partner, was voted on a list of "Game Heroes" by a
German web site.  George placed at number seven, ahead of Shigeru Miyamoto. ;)
With all due respect to George, this just goes to show that certain voters are
clueless.   Miyamoto should be #1 on anyone's list.  Miyamoto came in at
#8 on similar list in Computer Gaming World this month, which is also crazy.
My top five list world by Miyamoto (by a wide margin at #1), then John
Carmack, Peter Molyneux (Bullfrog founder), Eugene Jarvis (Defender, Joust,
many others), and Nolan Bushnell (founded Atari, pong, and the video arcade
industry).  These are all pioneering people who have struck gold and set new
standards more than once, which is very tough to do in any industry and
shows that the first time was not just luck.

There's a long list of deserving pioneers with names I can't remember, such
as the developer(s) of Pac Man, Space Invaders, Asteroids, and other key
arcade games, and also early computer games, who will likely be forgotten
on all such lists because newer players don't remember these games, and
older players have mostly forgotten them.  Maybe there needs to be a Game
Industry Hall of Fame set up so these pioneers will not be forever forgotten.

Got the new October issue of Computer Gaming World yesterday.  The Editorial
plus the entire Letter's to the Editor section both focus on Shadow Warrior.
Woohoo!  You've got to love it--we sure do.  The same thing happened when we
released Duke Nukem 3D.  CGW had at least 8-10 letters about Duke not being
politically correct and against females, etc.  Now Shadow Warrior is viewed
as racist.  It seems like if there's a pot of sh!t being stirred in this
industry, Apogee has a hand on the big spoon.  We like it that way, too,
because we're a controversial company by choice, we do not shrink away from
issues that would send PC-anal companies running with their tails tucked
between their legs.

That said, we did not intend for Shadow Warrior to be a racially demeaning
game in any way whatsoever.  This was not part of the game's design, nor a
part of our agenda to get more press.  Johnny Wilson, in his Editorial,
points to the "coolie hat-wearing zombie [as] a good example" of the game's
racism.  However, if you look up "coolie" in the dictionary (I've checked
several huge dictionaries), such as Webster's II, 1996 edition, the
definition of "coolie" is "An unskilled laborer of the Far East."  It
mentions nothing about coolie being an offensive nor racial term.  On the
other hand, you will not find "nigger" in most dictionaries, nor other
obvious racial terms (and if you do it will say that the word is offensive).
The dictionaries I've checked do not consider coolie a racial term.  We
thought we were safe using coolies, but it appears we were not.  Our mistake.
But in this overly PC society, it's almost impossible to make any piece of
entertainment without stepping on someone's toes.  Just look at the trouble
Disney, the ultimate family entertainment company, is getting into nowadays.
It's just crazy.  Every company must now walk on eggs without breaking one,
else it ends up on our face.

Another point I want to address is that Johnny Wilson implies that because
we didn't capture the true essence of Japanese culture with Shadow Warrior
that it's therefore a bad game.  With this, too, I wholly disagree.  Shadow
Warrior might not capture Wilson's vision of an Asian game, but it captured
our vision pretty well, succeeding as a game that, like Duke, doesn't take
anything too seriously, has a lot of humor and interactivity, and is a wacky
blend of all things Asian.  This game met our objectives well.  The only
problem is that it took a year longer to come out because Duke 3D took off
so well and consumed our time doing add-ons, etc.

Other:

Conspiracy Theory:  Great movie, though a little long.  Patrick Stewart
plays a great villain, and I hope he's used more in this role.

Cop Land:  Another very good movie, though not much action.  Stallone plays
a meek sheriff who looks the other way on a corrupt NYPD division, but in
the end he does the right thing.

The Discover channel and The Learning Channel rule.  They're *always* the
first two channels I turn to when I click on my TV.  This weekend's shows
about volcanoes were riveting.  Prime time TV...I couldn't care less
anymore.  Haven't watch those mindless cop shows and sitcoms in at least 10
years--my time is too valuable.  Sports are cool, though.  ;)

[1]  Mario Kart 64 is a terrible multiplayer game.  Here's why:  The game
cheats for the non-player cars, allowing them to catch up with you beyond
their cart's real ability to do so.  But even worse, the player that's leading
the race is heavily penalized by not being able to get the good power-ups.
The other players are able to get the good power-ups, though, which,
although it keeps the game competitive, is totally unfair for the better
players who are leading.  Basically, having a lead in this game is a bad
strategy until the very end!  Any game that forces a strategy in which
having a lead is a bad tactic is a lame game in my book.

When I play this game against friends, I make everyone agree not to use the
power-ups.  This is the only *fair* way to play this game.

The designers of this game should have given us a few options, such as a no
power-up option, and an option in which anyone, regardless of their position
(from first to last) has an equal chance to get any power-up.

I've broken two controllers in pure anger because I can't stand how unfair
this game can be.  ;)

[2]  Computer Gaming World has a article titled "The Most Influential People
in Computer Gaming."  They rank 15 people and somehow I made the list at
number 14.  ;)

[3]  Go to www.avault.com for a great interview with Paul Schuytema, project
leader of Prey.

I was asked by a magazine editor yesterday about my thoughts on piracy for
an article they're doing.  In part, here's what I said:

"I'd be happy to give you some comments on piracy.  We've been a
victim with all of our games, including our major games.  Frankly,
piracy stinks, it's a crime against hard working developers, and it's a
crime against legitimate game buyers who have to shoulder the cost of
piracy through higher priced games.  Pirates are idiots, petty thieves
and losers who justify their crime by pointing to the high software
prices they themselves help maintain.  I have no respect for
pirates--the world would be a far better place without them."

Update on patent:  Someone passed along Ernest Kettelson's (the attorney
behind this absurb patent) email address.  The person wrote: "May I suggest
posting the lawyer's Email address (ketlaw@ix.netcom.com) in your .plan so
everyone can be sure to let this clown know how they feel?"

Sounded like a good idea to me.  ;)

I've been reading the September issue of Next Generation magazine.  One of
the big questions asked by the editors in the inside cover is, "Is
technology finished?"  "John Romero thinks so," says the magazine (though
I'm unsure if Romero actually told them this.)  "Shiny's Dave Perry couldn't
disagree more," continues the text.

Now then, I'm not a David Perry fan, and I despise the fact that he's trying
to patent (here we go again!) some fairly obvious engine technology (which
we're already doing in Prey, btw--it ain't no big deal).  However, on this
point, I agree with him that technology is no where close to being finished,
and never will be, just
