Been watching people around the office play Jedi Knight.  Looks like a fun game
(great sound effects), though I wish the levels had better shadowing effects--the
lack of contrast gives the game a dated look.  However, LucasArts has a giant
advantage in having the Star Wars universe to base games on.  This advantage pretty
much insures that anything they do associated with Star Wars will be a big hit.
Must be nice.  ;)

Also, I'm looking forward to Activision's Battlezone.  The was an arcade favorite
of mine (I could play indefinitely on one quarter, and often played for hours at a
time hunting down those saucers).  The only problem I foresee is in recreating the
original Battlezone controls.  That's the problem with porting arcade hits like
Robotron, Missile Command and Tempest to the PC--without the original custom controls
those games are not nearly as fun to play.

We've got a lot of good feedback on the Shadow Warrior novels.  Unlike the DOOM novels,
which were widely panned, the Shadow Warrior novels encompass an entirely original story,
with ties back to the game.  We'll have the first chapter available on our web site very
soon.  If you liked the Destroyer series, you'll like the Shadow Warrior novels, too.

In stores soon with be the Duke Nukem Kill-o-Ton Collection, which puts in one oversized
box everything ever released relating to Duke Nukem, Duke Nukem 2, and Duke Nukem 3D.
This will be Duke's second Xmas--the game came out early in '96 and is still selling
better than most games recently released.  On CGW's "Playing Lately" list Duke 3D is at
position #6, and has been on the list 19 months straight, longer than any other game.
In Europe it's been #1 or #2 on the Budget Top Ten for six months straight.  In the
history of games, there's been maybe a handful that have sold more on a PC.  The N64
version already has store pre-orders over 300,000 in the USA alone.  The PSX version has
incredible pre-order numbers, too.  Things are looking good for Duke.  :)  Then there's
the collectors statue, action figures, novels, secret PSX project, Sega Duke, Tiger
Electronic's two Duke games, Genesis Duke, the movie, the Duke table in Balls of Steel,
and Duke Nukem Forever.  Maybe one day Duke will be bigger than Star Wars!  (Okay, you
can lock me up and throw away the key now.  )

Finally, Cowboys chop Giants down to size, 27 - 17.  It might be another sloppy win, but
we'll take it.  :)

An observation:  In the last two days I've read through the new Computer Gaming
World, Next Generation and PC Games magazines.  It occurred to me reading through
all the game previews that it's amazing how much attention games get before they're
even released.  It used to not be this way.

During the 80's and even early 90's most games were first mentioned in the reviews
section, after they were released.  Rarely were games previewed, or talked about
before their release.  One reason is because games mostly took 6 - 9 months to make,
so there was no reason to talk about a game before it was done.  Of course, now games
take about two years, so there's much more time to talk about them before they're
released.  Also, there wasn't the online game community like there is now, which
excites players into wanting to know more and more about games on the horizon.

Next Generation gives each previewed game at least a full page article, while their
reviews area rarely gives a game a full page, usually about a half-page.  Something
seems screwed up here, but I'm sure they know best what their readers want.  And what
we want is to quench our insatiable thirst to know what's ahead, and is it any better?

Let's hope so.


BTW, thanks for correcting your mistake, Brian.

*  A ton of people have emailed me asking about pre-ordering the Duke Nukem 3D
collector's statue by Moore Creations.  We'll have ordering information on our
web site as soon as it's available, I expect in 4-6 weeks.  Also, if you want
to check out the action figure, you can visit www.resaurus.com.

*  I guess there are very few original ideas for game ads.  I just got the Nov.
issue of Computer Games Strategy Plus, and on page 20 is an ad for Sierra's Half-Life
that has this headline:  "She's smart...and knows that the way to a man's heart is
through his sternum."  Gee, isn't this really similar to our recent Shadow Warrior
ad, that said:  "Meditation is the way to the heart... Shadow Warrior says go straight
through the rib cage."  OTOH, the Quake 2 ad in that same issue looks original and inspired.

*  Monday Night Football Commentary -- Free advice to the team that is about to kick
the last second winning field goal:  Don't do it!  Go for the touchdown instead.  ;)

*  Soon after Duke 3D's release we were asked to do a PC game version of Men in Black,
which we turned down (games based on movies rarely do well, unless it's a Star Wars game).
Last week a major studio contacted us about doing a game based on a sure-hit futuristic
movie coming next summer (can't say the name, under NDA).  The problem is that we're
knee-deep in Prey and Duke 4, so these are not projects we can realistically get involved
with, but it's still fun to get the offers.

*  Finally, for anyone who cares, I've bought two Forgotten Worlds, one for the office
and one for home.  Posting a "want to buy" message in the proper news group did the trick.
Thanks to everyone who helped me out in finding these rare machines.

*  The just out issue of Boot Magazine (w/ Alex St. John on the cover) has a
column titled "Game Theory" by T. Liam McDonald, that talks about the controversy
surrounding our just-released Shadow Warrior.  Part of what he says:  "3D Realms
has an uncanny knack for pissing people off about the content of its games...But
to some, they stepped over the line with Shadow Warrior...Is it offensive?  Sure.
Is it funny?  It's freakin' hysterical.  Should we be upset that it's offensive?
Hardly."  McDonald makes several strong points in his column, and I highly
recommend reading it.

*  Moore Creations sent us a prototype of the Duke Nukem 3D statue.  It's
about 10" high and 2.5 lbs.  Its quality and detail level is top notch.  We have
been working with Moore for seven months getting this thing done, and done right.
It's been reworked several times because we're very picky about the quality and
the realism being as good as possible.  The end product is drop-dead amazing.
We'll have the real thing finished in a few weeks, then have pictures on our
web site.  Moore Creations expects to sell all 8000 (it's a limited edition run),
at around $200 each.

*  We've got several totally breakthrough ideas with Duke Nukem Forever and Prey.
Both these games, I truly think, will be seen as genre-expanding standard setters.
Anything you've seen or played or heard about in other 3D shooters will not prepare
you for the coolness we've got in store for you.  ;)

*  Balls of Steel is oh so close.  We're just going back to the recording studio to
get some more voices to fill in some missed gaps, and then this puppy will be set
free.  There's no doubt in my mind that's it's the best PC pinball package yet, and
the Duke Nukem 3D table itself is nothing short of brilliant.  Here's one cool thing
from the Duke table:  collect the scuba gear power-up for the underwater mission,
with floating mines to destroy.  Each table has great missions, great in-game
animations, blood and gore, voice effects galore, and many secrets.  Sure it's just
pinball, but you've never played it like this.  ;)

On www.avault.com is a new feature on how to get into the industry as a
level designer, with many quotes from 3D Realms mappers.  Mappers are extremely
important to the success of a 3D game--their work is where the rubber meets the
road.  Mappers take the features given to them by the coders, and the graphics
by the artists, and combine them to make the worlds we play in.  We are extremely
selective in hiring mappers because a bad mapper can wreck a project, and a great
mapper can more it better than originally intended.

*  18 months after Duke Nukem 3D's release and it's still getting covers on
magazines!  This time the Sept/Oct issue of Music & Computers
(www.music-and-computers.com), which has a great feature story about sound
artist Bobby Prince, who got his start through Apogee in 1991 (I found him in
a music forum on Prodigy ).  Bobby has since done work on these games:
Commander Keen, Duke Nukem 2 and 3D, Wolfenstein 3-D, Bio Menace, Realms of
Chaos, Rise of the Triad, Xenophage, Blake Stone, id's DOOM 1 and 2 and many
with other developers.  Truly one of the industry's top talents and
nice guys.  Visit his site at www.bpmusic.com.

*  Okay, still licking my wounds from last weeks Cowboys' crashing, but the
lowly Eagles are soaring into town for Dallas' first home game, and even
though they're green with envy over the Cowboys' three Superbowl wins in five
years, they're going to be leaving Texas feeling blue--Cowboys blue, that is:  23 - 17.

My comments on Mario 64 and Miyamoto has elicited a flood of great responses,
with people giving me all sorts of lists.  So, for the record, here's *my*
list of the 10 all-time greatest arcade, console or PC games:

[1]  Forgotten Worlds -- What?  Never heard of it?  I only saw this game at
one location, a Putt-Putt in Mesquite, TX, in 1988.  It was a one- or two-player
game in which you controlled a male hero-type who started with meek weapons but
could build up an arsenal of incredible weapons by killing bad guys, collecting
"zennies," and using the zennies to buy better stuff in shops between levels
(and some shops hidden in levels).

The variety of this games scrolling scenarios has yet to be matched in a
scrolling action game.  Plus, you could choose different paths at certain
spots, adding to the game's replayability.  Most of all, this was one of the
last *fair* games of it's type, allowing a master player to finish it on one
quarter, which took about 25 minutes to reach the incredible ending.

I can't describe well enough all the details, variety, cool enemies, and
options in this game that make it number one on my list.  If anyone knows
where I can buy one of these please let me know.

[2]  Asteroids -- Simple, relentless, innovative and tough to master.  My
longest game was about five hours and I quit with dozens of ships.  George
played a 20+ hour game, trying to beat the world's record (40+ hours), but
got too tired to continue.

[3]  Tempest -- Truly innovated and addictive.  My best score was over
800,000--I was able to reach the final "white" levels on one quarter, but I
was the manager of an arcade during the early to mid-eighties, and got to
play all these games for free.

[4]  M.U.L.E. -- My first multiplayer game, and one I won a lot of money on.  ;)

[5]  Planetfall -- The first game that evoked sadness, because of Floyd's
sacrifice.  Never will a graphics adventure invoke better images than a text
adventure--it's not even a fair battle.  This and other Infocom titles inspired
me to write two text adventures of  my own:  Beyond the Titanic (1986) and
Supernova (1987).

[6]  Jumpman (and Jumpman Jr.) -- I loved the puzzles along with the action.
Plus, each level added something wildly new and surprising.

[7]  Missile Command -- I got so good at this game I would play without
losing a city up until the point when the game would overload, which
happened around the score of 825,000, at which point it'd give you 256 bonus
cities, so higher scores were bogus.

[8]  Rogue -- The game that inspired my seven Kroz games, which started Apogee.

[9]  Ultima 3 -- This was the final Ultima before the series got too involved.

[10] Donkey Kong -- Stupid name but incredible, innovative game.  The first
arcade game to use hardware sprites, I believe, too.

Other top games include Space Invaders, Battlezone, Defender, Robotron,
Space Duel, Enchanter, Space Quest 3, Rick Dangerous and Archon (original).

Having lived in the Dallas area since 1978, I'm a certified Cowboys fan.
I'll have a little fun each Friday predicting the coming Cowboys game.  This
week we battle the Steelers.  Prediction:  Cowboys melt steel 30 - 17.

BTW, I predict Cowboys against Denver (maybe Steelers) in the Superbowl,
unless key injuries occur, of course.

Digging through my library of computer books I've kept for
the past 20 years, I came across Dvorak's Guide to PC
Telecommunications, released in 1990 (over 1050 pages long).
There's a chapter on shareware, which contains this text:
"Shareware is not a good plan for all programs...As a rule,
the following genres of shareware programs haven't been
clearly successful:  Games, Utilities & Vertical programs."
