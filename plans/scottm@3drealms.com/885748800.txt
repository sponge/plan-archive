A local developer who previously worked here (and is now at another
job) had this to say in a recent interview on a fan web site:

"[A]s many development teams are figuring out, there's really
no need for a middle man like 3D Realms anymore.  It's the
publisher that's doing the marketing and distribution and the
talent that's making the game.  3D Realms supplies office space
and computers and some small benefits at a cost of more than
half of the royalties from the game, but that stuff isn't so
expensive as to make independent development prohibitive."

What a dumbass thing to say!

Does this mean that any developer with more than one team is
a so-called "middle man"?  Does this mean that ION Storm,
Ensemble Studios, Epic MegaGames, Terminal Reality, Parallax
Software, Ritual Entertainment, Firaxis, Digital Anvil,
Lionhead, Raven and a dozen other development companies with more
than one internal team are middle men?!

Get a friggin' clue!  3D Realms *is* a developer.  Duhhh!  And
in fact, we do more than most developers because we also have a
significant direct order business (a business we pioneered), via
shareware marketing, that most other developers do not have--and
this business generates even more royalties for developers that
work here that otherwise would not be had by them.

It's been a while since I needed to rant, but this remark was
simply too ignorant to let pass.

We got in 50 Duke porcelain statues yesterday for the crew.
Only 8500 of these are being made, all numbered, and Moore
Creations expects them to sell out.  This is the kind of
collector's item that in 25+ years will likely be very
valuable as Duke's popularity continues to grow.  And with
the movie deal making big strides (we've signed a big-name
producer) there's a good chance that this statue could be
sold out quickly and worth substantially more than the selling
price within a few years.  Don't you wish you would have
bought the original Star Trek or Star Wars collectors items?  ;)
Now's your chance to get in while the gettin' in is still cheap.
You can reach Moore Creations at (817) 568-2620.

Now using the cordless (radio frequency) Logitech mouse.  The
shape takes a bit of getting used to, but once that hurdle is
jumped it's much easier to use than a wired mouse.  It's just
as responsive, but the lack of cord gives it a big edge.  It has
a side button for the thumb that can be programmed to any of 20+
functions, such as auto-double-clicking.  I use it to control the
up/down scroll bar, which makes it more convenient than the wheel
on the new Microsoft mouse.

With all the news surrounding Clinton and his affairs, his
nickname, Slick Willy, takes on a new meaning.

Not a difficult puzzle, but a good starter after the long break:
What is at the beginning of eternity, the end of time, the
beginning of every end, and the end of every place?

Finally got the new finger system in place.  Puzzles will resume this Friday.

www.GameSpot.com has been running a reader's most anticipated game poll,
pitting the following games against each other:  Diakatana, Unreal, SiN,
Half-Life, Prey and Duke Nukem Forever.  The latter three games won their
rounds against the former three, and are now facing off against each other.
Last I checked, with over 175,000 votes in, Prey was winning with 82%, Duke
second with 17%, and Half-Life had the final 1%.  I think Duke is so low
because we haven't promoted it much, yet.  After E3, that will change.

We're putting together the "bible" for Duke Nukem now, also known as a style
guide.  This document reveals everything there is to know about the Duke
character, his background, defining traits, pictures and poses, things he'd
say and not say, other key characters in his universe, like Bombshell and
Proton, and anything else pertinent.  This will be used for the upcoming novels,
comics and potential movie.

We have specific intentions with the Duke movie, and our plan is to make sure
it's cool.  For example, we will make sure Duke doesn't have any dumbass
sidekick that just gets in the way (like the sidekick in Judge Dredd).  We'll
also make sure there are no kids that need to be saved, or help Duke save the
day.  And we'll insure this isn't one of those movies in which viewers say,
"Well, why didn't they just drop both atomic bombs down the mine shaft and be
done with it!" like the good-guy character in Broken Arrow should have done.

Finally, we got two of the Duke Nukem porcelain statues in last week.  There
are only 8500 of these made, all numbered, so earlier orders get the earlier
numbers.  They have greatly exceeded our expectations quality-wise.  They're
about a 10 inches high and weigh a few pounds each, feeling very solid.  The
closer you look at the model the more details you see.  Check out
http://www.moorecreations.com, and our web page, the Licensed Products area
(under "Latest Apogee/3D Realms News!") for more details and pictures.

Just finished reading a fascinating new book, "In the Company of Giants," by
Rama Dev Jager and Rafael Ortiz (ISBN: 0-07-032934-6). The book has revealing
interviews with 15 key CEOs in the computer industry, including Steve Jobs
(Apple, NeXT, Pixar), Steve Case (AOL), Michael Dell (Dell, duh), Andy Grove
(Intel), Trip Hawkings (Electronic Arts and 3DO flounder, oops, I mean founder),
and Bill Gates (Altair BASIC ;). This book is full of relevant advice for any
business, such as this crucial nugget by Steve Jobs: "A small team of A+ players
can run circles around a giant team of B and C players."
