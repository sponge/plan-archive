[1]  Mario Kart 64 is a terrible multiplayer game.  Here's why:  The game
cheats for the non-player cars, allowing them to catch up with you beyond
their cart's real ability to do so.  But even worse, the player that's leading
the race is heavily penalized by not being able to get the good power-ups.
The other players are able to get the good power-ups, though, which,
although it keeps the game competitive, is totally unfair for the better
players who are leading.  Basically, having a lead in this game is a bad
strategy until the very end!  Any game that forces a strategy in which
having a lead is a bad tactic is a lame game in my book.

When I play this game against friends, I make everyone agree not to use the
power-ups.  This is the only *fair* way to play this game.

The designers of this game should have given us a few options, such as a no
power-up option, and an option in which anyone, regardless of their position
(from first to last) has an equal chance to get any power-up.

I've broken two controllers in pure anger because I can't stand how unfair
this game can be.  ;)

[2]  Computer Gaming World has a article titled "The Most Influential People
in Computer Gaming."  They rank 15 people and somehow I made the list at
number 14.  ;)  If anyone is interested in reading this and see who else is
on the list (I don't agree with Alex St. John being on the list at all!),
go to "http://cgw.gamespot.com/cgw.nsf/Webindices/News" and look for the
news item posted on 8/22/97.

I was asked by a magazine editor yesterday about my thoughts on piracy for
an article they're doing.  In part, here's what I said:

"I'd be happy to give you some comments on piracy.  We've been a
victim with all of our games, including our major games.  Frankly,
piracy stinks, it's a crime against hard working developers, and it's a
crime against legitimate game buyers who have to shoulder the cost of
piracy through higher priced games.  Pirates are idiots, petty thieves
and losers who justify their crime by pointing to the high software
prices they themselves help maintain.  I have no respect for
pirates--the world would be a far better place without them."

In the new September issue of Edge (UK game magazine), Dave Perry,
president of Shiny (MDK fame), speaking about their new game in development,
Messiah, says of its engine:  "It's about two years ahead of any other game
development company's engine."

I wonder if he said this with a straight face, or was crack involved?

A few months before Quake appeared last year, I read a similar quote from
the CEO (Chris Weaver, I think) of Bethesda Softworks, in which he said
something to the effect that they had solved problems that put their 3D
engine about a year ahead of anyone else and he even mentioned being ahead
of id, too.  A laughed then, and now I'm laughing at Dave "Clueless" Perry.

We had two people from Intel here yesterday talking about their future
technologies such as APG pathway and coming chips, and of course we gave
them a showing of our Prey engine to show them what we were up to.  Turns
out these same people had recently seen Shiny's Messiah engine.  They told
us that Prey's technology is ahead of anything they've seen, no contest.
They said they were stunned by what they saw and specifically mentioned
other still-in-development engines, including Messiah's, as being inferior.

I don't want to come off as bragging, but it's crazy for *any* company to
think they're one or two years ahead of other top developers, especially
developers such as us and id who *specialize* in 3D games.

>>>  OK, Scott. Here's some accurate history. Id Software made Apogee
what it is today, and Apogee's success with Duke Nukem is a result of
shamelessly copying everything id Software does. <<<

The above written today in Dave Taylor's plan (Crack.com).

Dave, the fact is that id probably wouldn't exist like it does today if it
wasn't for me contacting them in 1990 while they were employed at Softdisk,
Inc. and convincing them that shareware was a viable way to make money.  (No
game at all made money until Apogee invented the multiple episode method in
1987.)  Wolfenstein 3-D probably wouldn't exist, either, since it was I who
convinced them to make a 3D game for shareware (I still have the proposal I
made for them in my files), when at the time this was not the course they
were going to take due to contract legalities with Softdisk.  I think id
and Apogee owe each other equally.  We both helped each other become
greatly successful.  You weren't even around when any of this happened.
Get a clue.

As for Duke being a shameless rip-off of DOOM, it looks like you overlooked
many of Duke's ground breaking innovations, such as interactivity, humor, a
bigger-than-life character who actually speaks, and a lot more gameplay
and content than any previous 3D action game.  A mindless clone doesn't
become one of the all-time top selling games.  Duke raised the bar in
several areas and was a perfect evolutionary enhancement over existing
games.  Once again, get a clue.

Wasn't it Carmack who said that no key person has ever left id other than
Michael Abrash?  ;)


I've asked C-Net's GameCenter to correct the following, but they've yet to
respond, so I'll make the correction for them here...

There's a great article about the 10 most innovative PC games of all-time on
www.gamecenter.com, and Wolfenstein 3-D is one of the games listed.  There
are two mistakes:  id Software is listed as the game's publisher, and
the release date is listed as 1991.  The *correct* information is that
Apogee Software published the game (id developed it), and that the game
was released in 1992 (May to be exact).

Why do I bother setting the facts straight?  It's history, and history
should be reported accurately, otherwise why report it at all?

Update on above:  Thanks to the editors at C-Net for correcting their
article, which can be viewed at:
http://www.gamecenter.com/Features/Exclusives/Hallofgame/ss08.html.

Update on patent:  Someone passed along Ernest Kettelson's (the attorney
behind this absurb patent) email address.  The person wrote: "May I suggest
posting the lawyer's Email address (ketlaw@ix.netcom.com) in your .plan so
everyone can be sure to let this clown know how they feel?"

Sounded like a good idea to me.  ;)

I've been reading the September issue of Next Generation magazine.  One of
the big questions asked by the editors in the inside cover is, "Is
technology finished?"  "John Romero thinks so," says the magazine (though
I'm unsure if Romero actually told them this.)  "Shiny's Dave Perry couldn't
disagree more," continues the text.

Now then, I'm not a David Perry fan, and I despise the fact that he's trying
to patent (here we go again!) some fairly obvious engine technology (which
we're already doing in Prey, btw--it ain't no big deal).  However, on this
point, I agree with him that technology is no where close to being finished,
and never will be, just as 640k RAM wasn't more than any computer would ever
need (as Bill Gates said when the IBM PC was first released).  Engines will
always need to be created to take advantage of the increasing power of
computers, their faster CPUs, and new enhancements, such as 3D accelerator
cards.  This will never end.

In the October issue of ePlay magazine (the second issue of a new and hard
to find magazine solely about multiplayer gaming), Tom Hall is asked by the
interviewer, "What makes [Ion Storm] different?"  Tom responds:  "The whole
premise behind the company is that we'll license other people's technology.
We want to just buy the canvas and paint on it; we don't want to build the
canvas.  And that allows us to have a lot more interesting content, really
focus on gameplay and what you actually get to do and fine-tune that,
rather than just crank out a bunch of levels."

I think its erroneous to suggest that any game built upon new and original
technology will have levels that have been "cranked out," without proper
attention to gameplay and interesting content.  It's true that without
having to worry about creating the underlying engine technology that more
focus can be placed strictly on design issues, but it's not true that
design issues have to automatically suffer for those developers who also
create their own engines.

In fact, design issues can blossom to take advantage of the new engine's
features and abilities.  It's just a matter of having the proper design
goals with the project, and not letting the engine itself *be the game*,
but instead the engine must *support the game*.

Id Software did this perfectly with Wolfenstein 3-D (and DOOM to a great
extent), in which we saw all-new engine technology and highly innovative
gameplay (for its time).  Quake, though, was mostly only innovative in the
technology area (including multiplayer), and wasn't so innovative in terms
of gameplay, which several of the game's designers themselves have stated.
(Q2 looks to have answered this criticism, btw.)

Our goal with Prey, for example, is to be highly innovative in terms of
gameplay *and* technology.  If we were to use the Quake engine for Prey,
we could only be innovative in gameplay, and we'd have a much less
impressive game overall.  In fact, many of the gameplay elements we have
in mind for Prey are only possible with our new portal technology.  This
shows one of many weaknesses in relying on older, previously seen and
played technology, since players prefer to see something new and original
technology-wise, just as much as gameplay-wise.

There will never come a point when the last engine is done and no further
improvements can be made.  At best, a 3D engine's life is two to three
years, and the first company to use that engine is usually the big winner.

Any developer that thinks they've developed the "final engine" is a
developer that won't be around long.  ;)

I am stunned!

I've never seen so much positive response of an issue--over 1000 messages,
all supportive except for one.  For those who don't know what's going on,
visit www.3drealms.com and read the top news item, regarding the patent
issue.

The full patent and letter that Apogee received has been scanned in and can
be viewed at:  http://www.nconnect.net/~tookycat/apogee/ 

If you care to voice your opinion to this attorney, Ernest Kettelson's law
office numbers are:

Phone:  815-467-1400
Fax:  815-467-1461

Obviously, this patent was one that should not have been granted because
it's so obvious in nature, and too broad.  The Software Publishers
Association (SPA) has been following this patent and has a report on
their site, at:

http://www.spa.org/gvmnt/wash1_8.htm#anchor1744787

I've heard from a dozen patent attorneys who've stated that it's their
opinion that this patent cannot hold up in court.  Here's the message from
one such attorney:

----- message begins -----

Saw your plan update.  BTW, I'm the author of the Quake editor BSP, so I
follow this community.  I'm also a patent attorney, so I was interested
in what Kettelson's client was trying to do.  I don't think I met with
you at e3, though I did meet a bunch of people in the community.

Anyway, I looked at the patent ('635) in question.  The claims (all 2
(not impressive) of them) look narrow in scope.  Don't believe the hype
in the letter.  Have your patent attorney pull the file history on this
patent and see what concessions the inventor had to make to get the
patent and what prior art was cited to the office.  The inventor may
have shot himself in the foot.  Has '635 been asserted against others? 
Any successes (previous litigation of the patent will show up in the
patent's file history, too).  Has the patent ever been reexamined?

To infringe, you would have to be doing each and every thing in one of
_the claims_.  Their spin on the claims is not relevant.  I would doubt
that you are doing _every_ thing in those claims.  If you are not doing
even a single "element" or "limitation" of the claim in question, you do
not infringe.  Those claims have a _lot_ of words (i.e., probably a
narrow patent).

Anyway, you probably knew that.  I think you guys will get past this one
pretty readily.

Between you and me, and I certainly haven't done any research and don't
know the facts, the patent seems bogus and its assertion makes us patent
attorneys look pretty low.  I can understand why the gaming community is
somewhat anti-patent... when this kind of stuff occurs.

----- message ends -----

The press has jumped on this story and nearly every major web site has
covered it, with more to come, including print magazines.  I'm hoping the
the patent owner (Craig Enokian of Illinois) and his attorney, feel the
heat from both the press and game players, and back off this scam.  I'll
post more news as I get it.
