The above link points to a story about Gathering of Developers on Upside Today, a nice daily news 
site.

The story contains this paragraph:  >>>Ironically, the industry's largest third-party game 
producer, Electronic Arts, started with the same Hollywood studio/independent creator model that 
GOD now preaches. "EA started with the same philosophy as GOD," says legendary developer Sid 
Meier, who runs Hunt Valley, Md.-based Firaxis Inc., which has a deal to make games that EA will 
publish.<<<

I've heard this misconception about Gathering several times.  Here's why it's wrong:  Gathering has 
a board of directors comprised of mostly developers.  The purpose of this developer-oriented board  
is to insure that Gathering does not become a publisher in which developer issues and concerns 
become secondplace priorities.

No other publisher has a board of directors comprised of developers that is setting company policy 
and vision.  Already several times this board has made policies and decisions that are in favor of 
developers, where at other publishers these decisions would have gone in favor other the 
corporation.

EA did not have a developer oriented board of directors to make sure their developer-oriented 
vision stayed in place, and that's why Gathering will succeed as a developer-oriented publisher 
where others have failed.

In the same article, Richard Hilleman, a VP at EA, says, "The more things change, the more they 
stay the same."  Hilleman is of course as wrong as Meier.  A publisher like the Gathering of 
Developers has been never attempted before, with proven developers helping to run the company
and maintain developer priorities.  With the Gathering it's the first time it's not Developers vs Suits, 
because the developers in this case are the suits.

Well, I don't usually give kudos to our competitors, but deserved pats on the back must go out to 
Raven for Heretic 2, Monolith for Shogo and Blood 2, Valve for Half-Life, and Ritual for Sin.  All of 
these games have their great points and are worth buying.  The 3D shooter genre seems to have 
matured to a point where nearly every effort is worthy and offers something new and fun.

Sorry, no pat for Dreamworks' Trespasser.  ; )

The current PC Gamer and other recent magazine editions have run articles listing the best 50 or 
100 games of all time.  My concern is that these lists often don't include older, groundbreaking 
games.  For example, should not a game like Wolfenstein 3-D be included because it kicked-off the 
3D first-person shooter genre?  Should not Myst be a lock because it's the best selling game of all 
time, and therefore the most popular game in PC history?  And how can any such list omit 
revolutionary and great games like M.U.L.E., and Wing Commander, and Tetris?!

Any Best Games Ever list without these games can't be a Best Games Ever list.

Wolfenstein 3-D is outdated and surpassed by six years of technically better 3D shooters.  Same 
with the other games listed above.  And that's the problem with these lists:  They often don't take 
into account how influential and innovative a game was for its time.  Instead, these lists mostly 
comprise themselves with games released in the past few years.  Do lists of the Best Novels Ever 
or Best Movies Ever only contain recent titles?  Absolutely not.

This is why I prefer Computer Gaming World magazine's Hall of Fame over lists of the Best Games 
Ever.  A Hall of Fame ignores games that are current hits and recognizes games that stand the 
test of time, impact the industry and influence their genre.  Best Games Ever lists contain too 
many games that come and go, but once a game makes the Hall of Fame list, it's there forever, 
and for good reason.

I'm not sure who would manage it, but I'd like to see an industry sanctioned Hall of Fame.  The 
SPA (Software Publishers Association) seems like an obvious choice to handle this, except they've 
shown themselves to be utterly inept with their annual Codie Awards, an industry farce that 
should be put to death like an annoying mosquito.

Unless something more official is formed, the CGW Hall of Fame will likely remain the best listing of 
our industry's best games, especially from a historical perspective.

Last week I went to ECTS in London, and then to Finland for a few days to visit Remedy 
(developers of Max Payne).

ECTS is a mini-E3, catering to the European game industry.  It's a worthwhile show because many 
of the attendees don't make the long trip to E3 and this is their chance to see all the coming 
games, hardware and meet people face-to-face.

Max Payne was the only game 3D Realms was showing at the show (no Duke or Prey), which was 
being demo'ed in the Take 2 booth, in a backroom area reserved for Gathering of Developer games.  
(Take 2 is the exclusive distributor of Gathering games in Europe.)  Remedy's Petri Jarvilehto 
(project leader) and Sam Lake (lead designer, story architect) showed the game for three solid 
days to impressed crowds.  I've heard through solid sources that Max earned at least two Game of 
Show honors from major industry publications (yet to be publicly announced).

The other three Gathering games on display (TRI's Nocturne and FLY!, Pop Top's Railroad Tycoon 
2) also made strong showings.  Other mighty impressive games I saw at the show were 
Anachronox, Outcast, King Pin, Super Bikes and Zelda.

Went to see a very cool movie in London one night, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels," (a 
low-budget English film that's as good as Pulp Fiction) and who's buying a ticket right beside me!?  
Bond... James Bond, a.k.a Sean Connery.  And he's seeing the same movie!  Too cool!  The movie 
mentions "James Bond" and I turned around to see Sean chuckling with his female friend (maybe 
his wife, don't know).  And no, none of us seeing the movie rudely asked for his autograph.

After ECTS I flew to Finland with the Remedy crew, staying in Helsinki.  I can't do justice to 
Finland's beauty, which I've heard it's comparable to northern Canada.  There are hundreds of 
lakes all surrounded by green forest on rolling hills of rosy granite.  Most family's in Finland have a 
computer, and *everyone* carries a cell phone--A Nokia phone, of course, since Nokia is a Finnish 
company.  Unlike the USA, which is just now going digital, Finland went digital half a decade ago.  
The just-out new Nokia phone is ultra small, all chrome, and doesn't have an antenna (its case it 
the antenna).  I tried to buy one but unfortunately it won't work in the States.  Damn.  I did buy a 
bulging sack of Finnish candy, though.  : )

We spent two days of solid meetings on every facet of Max Payne.  These discussions were so 
productive I'm returning in February to do it again.  Also did the Finnish sauna routine, 20 minutes 
of 216 degree skin melting torture followed by a dive into icy cold lake water, the latter which I 
refused to do!

Finally, I got to meet Peter Molyneux (founder of Bullfrog), the PC game designer I respect most, 
and spent copious time with Mark Rein of Epic Megagames, who is still full of ideas designed to rule 
the gaming world.  Also got to hang out with several other designers I respect, like Justin Chin and 
Dave Jones (head of DMA Design).  Overall, a terrific trip.

*  The premier issue of PC Accelerator says that Duke Nukem 3D is the greatest manly game of 
all-time.  Wait until they see Duke Nukem Forever!

*  I'm currently helping an author of one of the top gaming web sites write an article on 
shareware, how it started, who the early players were, and where it's going.  Part of this will 
include several tidbits about Apogee's early relationship with id, including the letter I original wrote 
to John Romero (in 1990) in which he thought I was some psycho fan.  Luckily, I kept good 
records from the "old days" and can quote directly from his letter.

*  Most people know about the Duke Nukem movie we're involved with.  As Obi Wan said, "There is 
another..."  Can't go into details yet.  This is why we make character-based games.  I wonder why 
most other developers don't do the same.

*  Duke Nukem movie made a big leap yesterday.  The most recent story draft is finally something 
that represents what we've been looking for.  We (Threshold and 3D Realms) have been molding 
and rewriting this thing for six months, but now we have a concept that excites us, and therefore 
we think will excite Duke fans.  Can't talk about details this early--sorry for the tease.  ; )

*  In the Sept. issue of Game Developer magazine (www.gdmag.com) Warren Spector writes a 
guest column ("Soapbox") that's hits on about a dozen design points that every game developer 
should know before heading into the dangerous world of game design.  For example, a big game 
world is not necessarily an interesting game world.  And conversational branching into a deep tree 
is rarely fun (most game players end up trying every single branch anyway, just to make sure they 
haven't missed anything, and this ends up being very tedious).  After reading this piece, I have 
heightened enthusiasm for Warren's coming game, Dues Ex.  I recommend all developers give this a 
read.

Sequels:  The Lame Name Game

Advice to publishers and developers of sequels:  Stop using the ultimate lame
name device:  sequel numbers.

3D Realms will never have a game title like Duke Nukem 4, Max Payne 2 or Prey
2.  We think those "sequel numbers" that follow a game's title are both
uncreative and lame.  Many movie sequels have equally lame titles, like the
Lethal Weapon sequels, the Godfather sequels and the Rocky sequels.

As an alternative, look at movie sequels that avoid using the lameness of
sequel numbers.  The Star Wars sequels, thank George, are not named Star Wars 2
and Star Wars 3.  Same with the Indiana Jones sequels, each having its own
original name, making each movie seem more like an episode in a TV series. 
George Lucas has figured out the sequel name game.

The Batman sequels, the Alien sequels, and the James Bond series also rely on
each movie having its own unique name, rather than simply attaching a lame
sequel number.  But some sequels try to have it both ways, going with a sequel
number and a new subtitle, like Speed 2:  Cruise Control, but this doesn't
work--the lameness of the sequel number is still there, plus the name is way
too long.  Why not just name the movie Cruise Control and lose the Speed
reference?   (E.g.  The sequel to Jurassic Park wasn't Jurassic Park 2: The
Lost World, it was simply The Lost World.  Lameness avoided!)

From a marketing standpoint, sequel numbers seem like a good idea, because they
build upon the awareness and equity built into the original title, but in the
long run they are detrimental because they look like rehashes of the original
product, rather than stand alone original works on their own.

Tomb Raider 2 and Tomb Raider 3 are both extremely lame titles.  If Eidos had
as much guts as their star character they'd have instead followed the Indiana
Jones model for their game titles:  Raiders of the Lost Ark is equivalent to
the first Tomb Raider title, in that in neither one is the starring character's
name used.  But in the next two movies Lucas wisely emphasized Harrison Ford's
character in the titles (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana
Jones and the Final Crusade).  The second and third Lara Croft games should
have followed this same model, with names like Lara Croft and the Lost City (or
whatever is appropriate to the each game's story).

The continued use of the Tomb Raider name in the sequels is lame in another
respect, too, because it forces each game to take place in a tomb location
every game, otherwise the title doesn't make sense.  Eidos is really missing
the boat by not emphasizing the Lara Croft character in their game titles, and
freeing up the versatility of the game's locations.

At 3D Realms, we don't even view games as sequels, we think of them as new
episodes in an on-going TV series.  Who thinks of each TV episode as a sequel
to the previous episode?  No one.  We apply the same thinking to our games and
our game titles, and so you'll never see a game named Duke Nukem 4, just like
an episode of X-Files isn't titled X-Files 117.

Here are more lame examples of sequel numbered games:

Warlords III:  Darklords Rising -- Why not simply Darklords Rising?

Blood 2:  The Chosen -- Why not just The Chosen?  Is connecting this game to
Blood really that beneficial!?  Look at DreamWorks' game, Trespasser, which
thankfully avoided the lame alternative, The Lost World: Trespasser--someone
had the smarts to realize they didn't need to blatantly attach "The Lost World"
brand to this game's title.

Might and Magic VI:  The Mandate of Heaven -- Why not just The Mandate of
Heaven and somewhere on the box have a Might and Magic logo, like James Bond
has the 007 logo?

Jazz Jackrabbit 2 -- I would have gone with the title Jazz and Spaz instead,
since both characters are emphasized heavil
