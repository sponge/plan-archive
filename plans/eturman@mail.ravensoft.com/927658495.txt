Wow! there have been quite a few responses, and a lot of really cool names -too  
many to post here :). I've defined the rules of the contest further down in
my .plan file.

Animation is coming along nicely, many of the female’s core animations are
already completed and ready for the programmers to do their magic. Speaking of
which, one of the really cool things the animators have at their disposal, that
GHOUL facilitates, is the ability to effectively eliminate foot sliding in the
game. For SoF, the animators have more control than ever before as to how the
animations look in the game.

***** A T T E N T I O N !   C O N T E S T ! *****
Does anyone have a suggestion for a cool name that I could give the animation
control system that I’ve made?  We'll even send the winner a Raven T-shirt!!!
***** A T T E N T I O N !   C O N T E S T ! *****

INFO:
The system supports both FK and IK, motion-capture and hand animation, and is
geared to bipedal creatures. It has a plethora of cyber-gadgets to accommodate
any animation task as well. A name that has other names that are linked to it
would be the most cool (i.e. ship, carrier, dreadnought, cruiser etc...).

RULES:
The contest will end this weekend (05-31-99) and a name will be chosen and
announced next week no later than Friday(06-05-99). The winning name will be
judged by versatility, creativity, and, of course, the biggest factor, coolness.
Multiple entries are allowed so long as you supply a new cool name(s).

HERE'S HOW TO WIN:
Just send a cool name along with your name, phone number,
and snail mail address, by clicking on <a href="mailto:eturman@mail.ravensoft.com?subject=Contest&body=Please do not remove the subject line!  Include your name, phone number, and snail mail address.">THIS LINK RIGHT HERE</a>!
If yours cool name is chosen, you'll receive a Raven T-shirt!

Good luck!

Let me start out with a brief correction from my last plan update. GHOUL does
support the Softimage .XSI file for importing our animations into GHOUL and I
didn’t get a chance to mention the fact that GHOUL also resides in the game
code (not just in host package for the processing part).

I was recently watching the DVD version of ANTZ while listening to the
alternate sound track of the two directors discussing the making of the movie.
Every time that there was a scene that required physical contact between
different characters, the directors would comment on how difficult a scene like
that is to animate because its easy to accidentally *push* a hand through the
body of the other character. When I saw that I thought, "Wow, they are having
trouble with that, and we’ve easily eliminated that problem with new null
hierarchy techniques and modifications."

The Null Hierarchy is being used in its current form for Star Trek Voyager’s
bipedal creatures. So they have access to SoF’s entire animation library.
There are a few improvements that I’d like to make to the animation control
system (Null Hierarchy) when things slow down a little, but they will have to
wait until such a time presents itself.

There was a lot of work to get the volume of animations into the game and
working real time and all of the animators busted their @$$ to deliver.
Jarrod Showers has been cranking out animations like a madman, many of them
heavily tweaked motion capture in addition to pure hand animation. And Joe
Sibilski, has had to come aboard and literally learn not only a new animation
system, but a whole new software package by the seat of his pants, and he’s
churning out the moves as well. And I have spent a lot of time and energy
making certain that it would all work by creating a new type of control system
for the animators (a null hierarchy). Null hierarchies aren’t anything new,
but the features that I’ve incorporated into this one are.
More on that another time...

All of the character modeling and animation was done in Softimage|3D, which
GHOUL currently does not support, and then piped into another package, that
hosts GHOUL, for processing into the game.

I’ve seen a lot of misconceptions about the animation system being posted on
the net. Not to undermine the significance of GHOUL, but there is a lot of
misunderstanding about what it is and isn’t responsible for. Yes, GHOUL is an
amazing system that gives us a lot of possibilities, and yes we did use motion
capture.  But GHOUL is NOT responsible for the look of the ANIMATIONS. GHOUL's
features include, but are not limited to:

Model render system
Model lighting system
Special effects
Skinning tools
Control over part visibility
Bolting separate models together
Etc...

Nor was motion capture the sole reason the animations look the way that they do.
Granted, the motion data that hOuse of mOves delivered to us was excellent. But
with animations having to mesh as seamlessly as possible with several each other,
not to mention motions that don’t look like they are really interacting with
their environment, there’s a lot more than just taking mocap and *plopping* it
on to a character.  Then again, if it were easy, our animation would look like
everyone else’s. ;)
