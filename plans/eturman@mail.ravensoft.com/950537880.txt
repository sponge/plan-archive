The 'tag fixer': This is a fix I made a while ago, but I just got positive 
confirmation of the difference that it makes;  I built a special component for 
Softimage that removes the 'jitters' that you see in Quake III on the upper 
body and head.  I call it the 'tag fixer' because the tag, used by Quake III to
attach the head to the upper body and the upper body to the legs is 
responsible for the trouble in the first place.  The component plugs directly 
into the CHIMAERA animation system that both SOF and Trek are using and also 
into the CHIMAERA hybrid systems for Voyager's creatures. 

If you like the animations in SOF and TREK, just wait until you catch a glimpse 
of our future projects.  I'll be creating a brand new animation system by the 
name of ZEUS that, when coupled with features of the next generation GHOUL, is 
going to blow you away.

Jarrod and I are taking the next couple of weeks to go over the animations with 
a fine tooth comb, making them look as good as possible. This is no small task
since we have around 500 character animations...and only around 200 of them
have motion capture as their primary source. We're also taking time to make some
special Death-Match-Only animations. If we have time, we could even hand animate
a few more deaths as well, but that would be relatively trivial ;). So its
pretty much spit and polish & tweaking at this point.

It seems that there are people who are confused as to what the CHIMAERA (British
spelling) really is. I have seen at least one web site that credits CHIMAERA for
what GHOUL is responsible for. When we decided to name it, we were only trying
to help define what the animators contributions to the project(s) were. Because
GHOUL was getting credit for the animators hard work. Now the reverse is
happening. Let me clarify a little.

The tools that the animators use are mostly separate from other aspects of the
game. This collection of tools that the animators use to alter motion capture
data and make hand animated sequences is called CHIMAREA. These tools were
built entirely in Softimage|3D and have nothing to do with other packages. They
are mostly contained in a Control Hierarchy...hence the First two letters in
the name CHIMAERA. CHIMAERA isn't a new modeling system nor does it replace
GHOUL. Instead data generated by animators using CHIMAERA is received by GHOUL
for processing into the game...it works with GHOUL.

The character models are also constructed in Softimage|3D in compliance with
GHOUL standards and attatched to the CHIMAERA system for animation. Not that
GHOUL doesn't have anything to do with animation...rather, GHOUL facilitates the
use of the CHIMAERA animation data in the game.

I hope this clears things up a bit.

Well, we received nearly 150 different suggestions for the name of the
animation control system. I compiled a list of names, we each looked over a copy
of the list and marked or favorites. Then all the animators (Rob Gee, Jarrod
Showers, Brian Shubat, Joe Sibilski, and myself...in alphabetical order) met and
tallied them on to one list and debated over the top three. There were so many
good names that this took some time. I'd like to thank everyone who entered for
all of thier creative names. But, in the end, there can only be one winner.

 
The winning entry is: 
			     *************************
Chimaera from Dave Phillips. * Congratulations Dave! *
			     *************************

Dave gave us this definition for Chimaera:
     "Legends speak of the Chimaera as a shape-shifter, a changeling spirit,
     diversely skilled and highly adaptable. Sounds like your animation system"

The best that I can describe it is:
It has the forequarters of a lion, the hindquarters of a ram, wings of a dragon,
and heads of a lion, a ram and a dragon's head that emerges from its tail/neck.

We adapted the name to: the CHIMAERA system. To be specific, the current Null
Hierarchy is now called: the CHIMAERA biped system 1.0. But plain CHIMAERA will
work just fine.

No acronym was provided (not that it was necessary), BUT we made one up anyway.

C--Control
H--Hierarchy
   with
I--Intrinsically
M--Modular
A--Adaptive
E--Entities
   for
R--Raven
A--Animation

Shubat has come up with a cool modeling technique that I definitely want to try
on the next project. But I have to stay on course so to speak. Speaking of
"course", I didn't mean to suggest that I wanted "ship" as a theme for the name
of the null hierarchy, just a name that could have a theme would be the most
versatile.

Jarrod S. & Joe S. have really been cranking away at transffering male moves on
to the female and tweaking them out while I've been applying raw female motion
data, tweaking, and doing some null hierarchy adjustments for Star Trek. To
that end, we are almost done with all of the animations for SoF. Soon we will
be able to make a final pass on the animations and work out any last problems.

Does anyone have a suggestion for a cool name that I could give the animation
control system that Ive made?  We'll even send the winner a Raven T-shirt!!!
***** A T T E N T I O N !   C O N T E S T ! *****

INFO:
The system supports both FK and IK, motion-capture and hand animation, and is
geared to bipedal creatures. It has a plethora of cyber-gadgets to accommodate
any animation task as well. A name that has other names that are linked to it
would be the most cool (i.e. shipis to carrier, dreadnought, cruiser etc...and
no, it doesn't need to be a ship name, that was just an example).

RULES:
The contest will end this weekend (05-31-99) and a name will be chosen and
announced next week no later than Friday(06-05-99). The winning name will be
judged by versatility, creativity, and, of course, the biggest factor, coolness.
Multiple entries are allowed so long as you supply a new cool name(s).

HERE'S HOW TO WIN:
Just send a cool name along with your name, phone number,
and snail mail address, by clicking on THIS LINK RIGHT HERE!
If yours cool name is chosen, you'll receive a Raven T-shirt!

Good luck!

Wow! there have been quite a few responses, and a lot of really cool names -too  
many to post here :). I've defined the rules of the contest further down in
my .plan file.

Animation is coming along nicely, many of the females core animations are
already completed and ready for the programmers to do their magic. Speaking of
which, one of the really cool things the animators have at their disposal, that
GHOUL facilitates, is the ability to effectively eliminate foot sliding in the
game. For SoF, the animators have more control than ever before as to how the
animations look in the game.

Let me start out with a brief correction from my last plan update. GHOUL does
support the Softimage .XSI file for importing our animations into GHOUL and I
didnt get a chance to mention the fact that GHOUL also resides in the game
code (not just in host package for the processing part).

I was recently watching the DVD version of ANTZ while listening to the
alternate sound track of the two directors discussing the making of the movie.
Every time that there was a scene that required physical contact between
different characters, the directors would comment on how difficult a scene like
that is to animate because its easy to accidentally *push* a hand through the
body of the other character. When I saw that I thought, "Wow, they are having
trouble with that, and weve easily eliminated that problem with new null
hierarchy techniques and modifications."

The Null Hierarchy is being used in its current form for Star Trek Voyagers
bipedal creatures. So they have access to SoFs entire animation library.
There are a few improvements that Id like to make to the animation control
system (Null Hierarchy) when things slow down a little, but they will have to
wait until such a time presents itself.

There was a lot of work to get the volume of animations into the game and
working real time and all of the animators busted their @$$ to deliver.
Jarrod Showers has been cranking out animations like a madman, many of them
heavily tweaked motion capture in addition to pure hand animation. And Joe
Sibilski, has had to come aboard and literally learn not only a new animation
system, but a whole new software package by the seat of his pants, and hes
churning out the moves as well. And I have spent a lot of time and energy
making certain that it would all work by creating a new type of control system
for the animators (a null hierarchy). Null hierarchies arent anything new,
but the features that Ive incorporated into this one are.
More on that another time...

All of the character modeling and animation was done in Softimage|3D, which
GHOUL currently does not support, and then piped into another package, that
hosts GHOUL, for processing into the game.

Ive seen a lot of misconceptions about the animation system being posted on
the net. Not to undermine the significance of GHOUL, but there is a lot of
misunderstanding about what it is and isnt responsible for. Yes, GHOUL is an
amazing system that gives us a lot of possibilities, and yes we did use motion
capture.  But GHOUL is NOT responsible for the look of the ANIMATIONS. GHOUL's
features include, but are not limited to:

Model render system
Model lighting system
Special effects
Skinning tools
Control over part visibility
Bolting separate models together
Etc...

Nor was motion capture the sole reason the animations look the way that they do.
Granted, the motion data that hOuse of mOves delivered to us was excellent. But
with animations having to mesh as seamlessly as possible with several each other,
not to mention motions that dont look like they are really interacting with
their environment, theres a lot more than just taking mocap and *plopping* it
on to a character.  Then again, if it were easy, our animation would look like
everyone elses. ;)
