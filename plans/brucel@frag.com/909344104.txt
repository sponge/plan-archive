The alpha testing of glDoom is going relatively well.
There have been some problems with Windows98 and some
driver incompatibilities that we're working on ironing
out.

I did some work on the light attenuation code today. I
put the fog code back in (black fog) and have tweaked it
some.  I also put a cvar in to control whether it tries
to use that.  The cvar gl_fog 0/1 will turn it off and
on.  I did this because some cards either don't support
it at all or don't do it right. (very strange looking)

Well, what do you know.  My very own .plan file...

glDoom went into alpha testing today.  I'm as nervous as
a cat.  I've never taken someone else's software (especially
not as popular as Doom) and made such drastic changes to
it before.

I really don't know what to expect from the testers at this
point.  All I know about how it will fare is how well it works
on my systems.  Still, I've got high hopes for it.

I should know in a day or two how things are progressing.

Stay tuned...
