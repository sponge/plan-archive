I just finished reviewing the help file for the Gruntz level editor that will be released shortly after Gruntz is on the shelvez.  At this point, I have no more Gruntz taskz ever again!... Except maybe to fix that bug where it will sometimes format your entire hard dr... er... I mean uh... nevermind. :)

I'm currently lending my programming skillz to another project at the moment.  I cannot say anything about it at this time, but I can say that I am in charge of the interface and the camera... uh... I mean... not that there is necessarily a camera... but if there WAS a camera, then I'd be in charge of it.  I can also say that if the interface turns out bad for any reason, then it must be because of the art. :-)

If you haven't checked out the Gruntz demo, get it now! :) From where you might ask?  Either from the Gruntz website or from gamespot.com.

So far the feedback has been great!  Thanks to everyone who has been posting comments on the forum, as well as those who have been sending me e-mail... keep em coming!  We're anxious to hear what gamers have to say about Gruntz. (Unless you have something bad to say, in which case you should keep your comments to yourself!) :)

First update of the new year!  The Gruntz site is up and the playable demo is available for download on the site!  Check out http://www.gruntz.com, download the demo, play it, and post any commentz or questionz on the Gruntz forum. (which can also be found on the site)

Remember people, it's Gruntz with a z... not an s.  So please don't complain to us if you type in www.grunts.com and you get sent to some other crazy site instead of the Gruntz site. :)
