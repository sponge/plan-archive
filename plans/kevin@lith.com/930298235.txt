Forgive me father Miyamoto for I have sinned.  It's been a few months since I last played Zelda 64.  I'm really looking forward to Donkey Kong 64 though... please let it have better gameplay than Banjo Kazooie... Not that I didn't like Banjo Kazooie, actually I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It's just that after collecting red feathers, gold feathers, eggs, notes, jinos, mumbo tokens, jiggys, and extra lives, I began to wish for a little more continuity in the game.

Anyhow, enough about that!  Sanity is coming along very well.  Garrett is crankin' away on the script and deciding how best to unfold the story while making sure not to give too little or too much plot info away.  

I finally finished the Psionic Talent list and am currently finishing up identifying where the player will acquire each of the talents.  After that, it's back to the boss encounters which is definitely one of the most fun aspects of the design of Sanity. :)

For those who haven't yet seen Sanity, be sure to check out the Sanity website at <a href = http://www.lith.com/sanity/>http://www.lith.com/sanity/</a>.
