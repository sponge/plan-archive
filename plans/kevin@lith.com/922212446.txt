I have returned from the Game Developer's Conference in Santa Clara with plenty of new insight into game design and the gaming industry, a great speech from Shigeru Miyamoto (creator of Mario, Donkey Kong, and Zelda), but most of all some really cool conference toys like the Aureal 3D squishy stress ball! :)

The conference was a whole lotta fun, a whole lotta partying and drinking, and a whole lotta game geeks (hey, we can smell our own).  Getting to talk head-to-head with some of the industry's leading game designers was a very invigorating experience, and getting to listen to the advice of game gurus like Steve Jackson, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Dave Perry was also a rare treat.

On the Gruntz front, Gruntz was released to retail last week and should be in just about every major computer retailer by the end of this week.  For specific locations, click here.

More Gruntz reviewz have been popping up at popular gaming websites including gamepost.com and gamespot.com. (Isn't it strange that those two sites contain the exact same letters?  Could it be a conspiracy?  Hmmmmmmmm)

I will leave everyone to ponder the following humorous quote which actually came from a very talented and well respected game designer at the conference (the humor lies in the fact that he was dead serious when he said this to me):

"When your project manager tries to get you to commit to a feature freeze late in the development cycle of your game and you still have good ideas... screw em!"
