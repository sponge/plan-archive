You've passed all the Gruntz Questz levels with ease... You've found all the secretz... You've laughed at the level designerz because you have single handedly tackled their puzzlez in record time. But how confident are you in Battlez mode? Have you got what it takes to bash memberz of the Gruntz team down in Battlez? We think not!!! We challenge you to prove us wrong! If you can, then you just might be the proud owner of a Gruntz T-shirt or other wonderful prizez!

--------

The Event: Test your skillz against the Gruntz team and other playerz in some massive multiplayer madness! 

The Date: Thursday, May 6th.

The Time: 5:00pm PST. (West coast time)

The Place: Use Portal.exe (download it here.) and connect to games.lith.com

The Prizez: Gruntz T-shirts, Gruntz Goo, and copies of Gruntz will be given out to the best of the best.

Are you a Battlez rookie, but you want to learn some really nasty trickz to help give you the edge against all your friendz? Be there and we'll give you the detailz!
