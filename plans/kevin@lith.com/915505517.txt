First update of the new year!  The Gruntz site is up and the playable demo is available for download on the site!  Check out http://www.gruntz.com, download the demo, play it, and post any commentz or questionz on the Gruntz forum. (which can also be found on the site)

Remember people, it's Gruntz with a z... not an s.  So please don't complain to us if you type in www.grunts.com and you get sent to some other crazy site instead of the Gruntz site. :)
