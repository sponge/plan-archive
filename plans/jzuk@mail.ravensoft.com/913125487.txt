I'm glad to see the responses we're getting for our little contest contest.  Everyone will know sometime Thursday which lucky site will be chosen to host our contest.  It'll be a fun one!  

BTW, everyone should check out Jeremy Statz's plan if they're interested in editing.  He brings up a very important point about entities.

Also, I saw an article at http://defrag.evilavatar.com/ with Raven mentioned near the bottom.  Hmmm... very interesting.  Heretic II in fact took about 12 months.  The first couple of months though are writing a design doc and getting a feeling for the project, so we were in production for only about 10 of those.

*******************************************************************************************

December 7th, 1998 -  We've got a little contest going!  Here are the details...

Greetings From Raven Software,

	We at Raven are considering sponsoring a contest for Heretic II modifications.  We would supply 
the prizes and judge the entries, but we need to find a suitable website to host 
the contest itself.  If you are a web master and are  interested in hosting this 
upcoming Heretic II competition, please contact Jon Zuk (jzuk@mail.ravensoft.com) 
or Kenn Hoekstra (khoekstra@mail.ravensoft.com) by Wednesday, December 9th at 
5pm CST.  After all bids are received, we will choose a website to host the contest 
and we will post the details and contest rules.
	Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.  We look forward 
to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Jon Zuk

I've had some questions on maps and creating your own stuff.  One thing that is confusing is creating your own textures.  We've written a program called qdata for converting .pcx's to .m8's but apparently we neglected to give any examples.  So, here is an example.

A .qdt file is simply a text file for clipping textures, skies, and sprites.  If you want to do this, open a new text file in Notepad.  Following is an example of what needs to be in there:

$mipdir General           	(Needed dir; in this case General)

;=================================================
; BRICKS AND STONES       	(Semicolon lines are comments and don't get used)
;=================================================

$load art/gfx/textures/general/final/teleport.pcx
$mip	teleport   0	0	128	128	stone

(This is to clip one texture.  The first line is to load a pcx from the specified path.  The second line after $mip is the name you want for the texture in the editor, its starting x and y values in the actual pcx [(0 0) is the upper left], the size of the texture, and its default sound.  You can also specify default surface flags such as transparency, water, sky, etc.)

Save the file as "name.qdt", "name" being what you want your texture set to be called.  (Note:  If you create your own texture set, you have to modify your heretic2.qe4 file so that the editor will see it.)

From the command line, go to the directory where the tools are installed and type "qdata name.qdt" to clip your textures.  Remember to give the appropriate path for the .qdt's location.

This should get you started.  Again, if you have questions, feel free to email me.

It's great to see the positive response for Heretic II out there.  I just got back from
a one week vacation to nowhere.  I stayed home and slept mostly.  But I also played Sin and
Half Life.  I'm not quite done with Half Life yet, but I'm very near the end.  This game
is really cool!  Other than that, it was nice to get a break after 14 months of crunch.  I
went right from the Hexen 2 Mission Pack right to Heretic II without a break.  That's a long
time to go without a vacation. 

If anyone has any map making questions, feel free to email me.  We're going to try and put
up a webpage of some sort to deal with design questions.  I'll post something here if we get
that up and running.  The documentation should answer most questions, but I probably missed
some things in the last few weeks.

Burning the late night oil again... still.

I've been browsing the 'net while waiting for a map to vis and I checked out the reviews
of our demo.  I have to say without a doubt, this is the best reception I've seen to one
of Raven's games.  Everyone who has previewed or reviewed has been most favorable in their
responses.  Thanks!  Just remember, the demo is just a demo!  Wait until the real thing.

I've already been getting questions about making maps for the game.  Fear not!  Our
wonderful (OK, passable) editor will ship with the game.  I've also written a manual to 
explain the inner workings of all our stuff.  Right now, the manual is at 66 pages, and
that's without the pictures.

In the meantime, enjoy the demo and we'll finish the game up for ya.  Remember, bugs can
be sent to heretic2bugs@mail.ravensoft.com.

Suggestions that are not bugs can be sent to heretic2suggestions@mail.ravensoft.com.

See ya soon!

Well, the demo is out.

Sorry about the lateness of it, but some things were unforseen.  We had to make sure the 
demo was as solid as possible and wouldn't re-format your HD or something.  

It was nice to get on IRC (I was a newbie), and chat with some of the fans.  I think
that my .plan file is a little safer... and slower.  I was having trouble keeping
up with the constant changes in conversation.

I hope everyone enjoys the demo.  If you have any problems (or praise), mail 
heretic2bugs@mail.ravensoft.com.

Now, we just have to get to Gold!

D-Day!

Today is Demo Day for Heretic II.  As everyone knows, it'll be out sometime tonight.

But, the real reason I've decided to update this thing after three months is to give out
a huge thanks.  This thanks is to the whole Heretic team in general, and the programmers
specifically.  They have worked their asses off this week to make sure this demo is complete,
solid, and fun.  This game has the funnest deathmatch I've played in a long time.  

Now that the sincerity is over with, remember to get on IRC tonight to chat with some of us
Heretic guys.  For info, check www.hereticii.com, a new (and cool) page dedicated to all 
things Heretic II.

See ya in deathmatch.  I'll be Shifty.
