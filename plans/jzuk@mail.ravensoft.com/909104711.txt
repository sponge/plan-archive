D-Day!

Today is Demo Day for Heretic II.  As everyone knows, it'll be out sometime tonight.

But, the real reason I've decided to update this thing after three months is to give out
a huge thanks.  This thanks is to the whole Heretic team in general, and the programmers
specifically.  They have worked their asses off this week to make sure this demo is complete,
solid, and fun.  This game has the funnest deathmatch I've played in a long time.  

Now that the sincerity is over with, remember to get on IRC tonight to chat with some of us
Heretic guys.  For info, check www.hereticii.com, a new (and cool) page dedicated to all 
things Heretic II.

See ya in deathmatch.  I'll be Shifty.
