Well, the demo is out.

Sorry about the lateness of it, but some things were unforseen.  We had to make sure the 
demo was as solid as possible and wouldn't re-format your HD or something.  

It was nice to get on IRC (I was a newbie), and chat with some of the fans.  I think
that my .plan file is a little safer... and slower.  I was having trouble keeping
up with the constant changes in conversation.

I hope everyone enjoys the demo.  If you have any problems (or praise), mail 
heretic2bugs@mail.ravensoft.com.

Now, we just have to get to Gold!

D-Day!

Today is Demo Day for Heretic II.  As everyone knows, it'll be out sometime tonight.

But, the real reason I've decided to update this thing after three months is to give out
a huge thanks.  This thanks is to the whole Heretic team in general, and the programmers
specifically.  They have worked their asses off this week to make sure this demo is complete,
solid, and fun.  This game has the funnest deathmatch I've played in a long time.  

Now that the sincerity is over with, remember to get on IRC tonight to chat with some of us
Heretic guys.  For info, check www.hereticii.com, a new (and cool) page dedicated to all 
things Heretic II.

See ya in deathmatch.  I'll be Shifty.
