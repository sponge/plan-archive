Project: Extreme Wing Chun VR for Unreal/UT

Unrealty is looking for a texture artist!

here's some info from my friend Vito:

Perilith Industrielle, producer of Unrealty (real-world 3D walkthroughs
using the Unreal engine), is in need of a texture artist! We're looking
for someone (or a couple someones) to assist us in producing several
hundred photorealistic textures to plaster over a virtual city, over the
next 8-10 weeks.

No relocation necessary. Pay is negotiable, possibly including a
separate hardware budget, and is dependent upon quality, experience, and
output. Continued employment after this project is a possibility.

To apply, send a few photorealistic "real-world" texture samples, no
larger than 512x512 each, to textures@perilith.com. Preferably at least
one clean, realistic building facade (such as an office, storefront,
Virgin Megastore, etc.), and a couple other samples like glass, brick,
cement, wood, carpet, that sort of thing. Questions can go there, too.No public key.
