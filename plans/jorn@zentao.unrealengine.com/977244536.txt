There are two new free tracks at my mp3.com page 

http://www.mp3.com/gamemusic

The first is called "S.U.V." and it's a collaboration between me and
Canadian singer Brad Smith. It's an extremely groovy song with a
thundering bassline. Brad is an amazing singer and delivers a rockin'
performance in this song!! A highly recommended download :)
I really hope that Brad and I will do more projects together in the future.
If you want to hear more Brad, visit his mp3 page:

or his band's mp3 page

The other new song is a little piano piece called "My Song For Christmas".
Like many of my other little piano pieces, it is only about 1 minute long
(and only a 1mb download if you want to listen to it). It's a very nice
and peaceful little song.

I am also working on another exciting collaboration... with an Indian
classically trained vocalist!!! More about that some other time.

God Jul osv.
