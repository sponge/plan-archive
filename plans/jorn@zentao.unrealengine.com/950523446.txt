My boss (min sjef) Alex... just discovered something about him. He has played Frankenfurter in Rocky Horror. (I think he still knows all the words as well.)

 O/  - with just a little bit of stea-hea-hea-heaaam...

If I ever find a picture of him in his Fraknefurter costume, I promise to post it on the net :)

Alex's description of the track:
"An exclusive .mp3 single written for Zen Tao Interactive's Extreme Wing Chun VR soundtrack by Jorn Lavoll. The track is called "Shaolin Temple", and will be featured during the environment's flythrough scene."

Everyone seems to be talking about snow in their .plans. 
Here in Bergen, Norway, the weather is actually quite pleasant for once. 
Sunny.

Anyways:

My little piano song about snow... the peaceful kind.

The music track from EWC that was posted at www.unreality.org (http://www.unreality.org/news_small.asp?Number=1711 to be exact) has been downloaded lots! I think Alex has decided to release a 2nd track shortly... I heard him muttering something like: "..... release.... music.. shaolin temple..."

If anyone is wondering... I don't practice Wing Chun myself. I'm a Tai-Chi guy :)
This is where I train: http://welcome.to/taiji
Yang style is what I have trained the most. I have also practiced QiGong (which might soon be illegal in China it seems) quite a bit.

[Jan. 26. 2000]

I ordered two flutes that I would use in the music for EWC. I got the order late (about 4 months late) and when I received them.. well.. In the box I found one flute smashed to pieces and one drum :) The drum is neat, I don't remember the name of the type specifically, it is one of those turkish/indian hand-held wide and flat drums. The drum is one of those things I would have like to have, but never would have ordered. The end of the story is that I got most my money back, but I am still on the lookout for a nice Dizi flute. I haven't tried really hard to, but I doubt that I'd find any place here in Norway that sells them.


"The not so likely scenario"
A tiny play by Jorn Lavoll

starring:

Jorn - Our Hero
Olaf - Music Retailer

(We are in a music store. On the walls we see guitars and posters displaying the latest in synthesizer and computer music technology. Olaf is standing behind the counter, ready to be nice and friendly and helpful to anyone who enter the store. Enter Jorn.)

 Olaf:
Hello there.
 Jorn:
Hello Mr. music store man.
 Olaf:
How can I help you?
 Jorn:
uhh.. well.. Actually.. I am looking for one of those.. uhh..
 Olaf:
Are you looking for a new guitar today?
 Jorn:
uhh.. no?
 Olaf:
How about this latest thingy in computer music technology?
 Jorn:
Que?
 Olaf:
Oh.. I know, you are looking for a quality Dizi flute. How lucky for you, we just got an excellent shipment of these flutes today.
 Jorn:
oh.. nice.. how lucky.

(Jorn leaves the store happily)

unreality.org interviewed me about my work for Zentao Interactive. 
If you missed it, you can find it here:

Included with the interview: a music track from Extreme Wing Chun VR. Enjoy :)


In other news... I was supposed to have started Tai-Chi training again last week. However, right now I am playing the piano for a children's musical and that eats up too much of my time. But it is good practic playing piano for a bunch of kids, right? No? (Oh, well... it's decent money at least :)


I was also pondering the way I "release" my music. When I discovered the sites like mp3.com and amp3.com and iuma.com and riffage.com etc. etc. I think I got a little carried away and uploaded lots of old stuff to all the sites. So the result is, as you can see now, that all the pages have all the same songs, and there's just an odd mix of songs. What I am thinking of is to divide the pages up in different genres, E.g. acoustic piano stuff can go one place, electronic ambient stuff goes someplace else etc. I also think I have to pick one site and try to maintain that one well, instead of having 10 that are poorly maintained... but then, which one to pick?
Even though amp3.com is much smaller, stinks when it comes to technical things, and don't promote themselves, I am leaning towards using that as the "main site" simply because I make the most money there. These last months I've made about $0.03 at iuma, $0 at riffage and musicbuilder.com, $0.26 at mp3.com and... about $250 at amp3.com.
If you'd like to visit these pages, and maybe even download an old song or two, here are the urls:

phew... there might be more sites that I've forgotten about.No public key.
