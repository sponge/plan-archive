Just saw the most amazing theatre performance ever last night. "The Wooster group" (http://www.thewoostergroup.org/) from New-York is here in Bergen. 
Before I went I had really high expectations, but still I was just blown away. 
The production is called "House/Lights".

"In House/Lights, the primary text is Gertrude Stein's opera libretto Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights, interplayed with a 1960's B-film classic »Olga's House of Shame« (about female dominance, submission and soft-core seduction) by Joseph Mawra. The Stein text is played against the backdrop of the film, infusing Stein's words into the Grand Guignol milieu of the Olga film."


Thankfully, I was able to get tickets for tomorrow's performance also :) 

The best theatre performance I've ever seen... amazing.

Out of curiosity:

Extreme Wing Chun, what kind of music would you expect/guess to be in EWC?

Drop me a line with your thoughts :)
