Holy crap! DUKE isn't modelled yet! No *wonder* we haven't been able to ship yet. We've been standing around looking at each other for months now trying to figure out what was missing from the game, giving up, and having Long Island Iced Tea races instead. Finally, thanks to the help of those who truly do know how these things are supposed to be handled we've now fixed this problem and DNF should be done in no time.

Thanks, we were going crazy around here! :D

Here I was thinking that he was the most important model in the game so it would make sense to do him at a later stage where your techniques and technology are rock solid. Silly silly Wieder!

Wieder breathes a sigh of relief on outta here...
