No real DNF info. Just a quickie update about soundtrack stuff.

If you really enjoyed the movie "Four Rooms", I highly suggest checking out the soundtrack. It has the same feel as it plays that the movie did. Quite eccentric and enjoyable. The only thing that would have made it a bit better was to include some Ted quotes but then again that may have distracted from the music.
