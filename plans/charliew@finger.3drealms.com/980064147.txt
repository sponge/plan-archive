"...which is partly my own fault due to some poor wording in an article I wrote. To set the record straight, there has been no official 'announcement', just some info provided by George Broussard during a PlanetCrap chat a few days ago."

For anybody who read the 3DR related article on The Register, Andrew Smith has corrected himself on his statements about the company in a recent news story on Planetcrap.

It should be pointed out that the "info" that Andrew mentions George provided during that chat was consistently reinforced as simply being "opinion" and "hypothetical" by George himself, as well as making a point that it was merely a discussion on the topic, not a discussion on what 3DR's intents or plans were. Why this information was not included in the original article, or in the story by Andrew Smith where he corrects himself, I do not know. Perhaps a more cynical person than I can answer that question.

I am glad to see that Andrew Smith has stated the confusion is his fault, has effectively admitted he made a mistake, and that he was wrong about the official intents of 3DR. I am however saddened to see that there is no correction on The Register where the original article was written.
