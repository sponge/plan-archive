To anybody who reads the little email exchange on Planetcrap: I hope you would be able to know instantly that it is 100% faked and none of the emails were sent by me. If someone is going to fake me I wish they would match my mannerisms a little better, but oh well. I do try to be a little more amusing when I flame someone, and last I checked I've never sent an email simply insulting someone. Instead I always try to talk them into submission. :) 

I'm flattered he would go through the effort to try to get me to post on a board. I didn't realize I was so important to him. Honestly, as if my ego wasn't large enough!

Regardless, all our email is stored here in house, it's an easy check to verify that I never sent them. Plus, hey... anybody on PC, why not simply ask him what my signature in my emails is? They are attached to every message I ever send.

Danke.

Wieder rolls his eyes on outta here...
