Email from Andrew Smith in regards to my update last night:

"There was a correction posted on The Register about 36 hours ago, shortly
after George pointed out the misunderstanding."

The article itself was indeed updated to correct the mistake of stating that 3DR had made or expressed any intentions of the restrictions mentioned.

However, nothing was put on the main page to notify the reader that the article had been corrected (you will notice several other articles contain an "Updated" flag) and nowhere else on the site is any mention of a change to the article mentioned. So, anybody who read the article prior to the change would have still been mislead and never had any reason to think the situation had changed.

My personal definition of a correction in regards to misreporting of facts is one that is made obvious to the reader, not the equivalent of fixing a typo. I guess that The Register/Andrew Smith and I don't match opinions on that.

Update: For people who want to email me and say that I am petty, that is fine. I'm sure I'll cry myself to sleep tonight but I'll be ok tomorrow. I'm simply alerting people to the situation in the most effective manner I have. The exact same right Andrew had and used when he felt the need to write the original article.

I could have started calling him names afterall... that *is* my typical reaction. Oh, and she didn't look over 18, but I didn't care this time. 17 is legal in Texas.
