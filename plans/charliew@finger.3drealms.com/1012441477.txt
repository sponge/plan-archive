If you are lucky enough to be given a beta copy of a game to play it, and for some odd reason are given permission to release a video of you playing it... SHUT THE HELL UP and stop recording yourself over the top of the game! I was trying to enjoy and check out the C&C Renegade video but the guys running it made it so I had to turn the volume down or finally jam my car keys into my ears.

This seems to happen a lot, especially when German webpages release videos. Why? People downloaded the movie to check out the game, not your jokes.
