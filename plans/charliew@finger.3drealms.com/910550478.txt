Playing Grim Fandango is an absolute treat. Lucas Arts definitely has a monopoly on the adventure genre. Tim Schafer and co. really know how to put together one helluva story.

Something to save any of you a lot of headaches if the game seems to crash unexpectedly a lot: Make sure your Windows video settings are set to 16 bit. 

Do this if you get any sort of slowdowns as well on a system that shouldn't get any. Once I did this the game ran flawlessly and silky smooth.
