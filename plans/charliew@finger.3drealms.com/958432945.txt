E3 wrap-up:

The schoolgirl stripper at the club we attended put my hat between her legs, walked around with it there for a while, and made faces that will make the strongest man weep. Easily one of the best schoolgirl shows I've ever seen in my life. She then told me to imagine where the hat had been everytime I put it on. The dollars started flying far too fast from that point on. As far as showing the guys a good time up on stage... she was the best. Thankfully I was the one wearing the hat. Definitely the stripper equivalent of Metal Gear Solid 2. The only thing she didn't do is dance to Britney Spears' "Baby One More Time". Then again, I don't think I could have handled that.

The Buffy look-alike who several of us call Jenny Paka (for reasons best left unsaid) filled my hat with her breasts and held it there with no hands. Another developer and I basically paid for her new living room set.

So basically, my hat got more action than any other person who attended E3... though the girls kept putting it back on Brian Cozzen's head. I'm not sure what that symbolized but I'm choosing to just imagine they wanted to force me to stand up and go get it so they could stare at my sexy body.

Gathering of Developers had booth babes coming to their booth in their off time. Hmmmm... I wonder where the place to be was. Most of the guys here at 3DR now have sunburn just because we didn't want to leave the area.

Oh, and there was a cool game here and there. *shrug*

"Gi gi gi gi"
"Slap Slap Slap"

Wieder closes his eyes and starts to rub his baseball hat...
