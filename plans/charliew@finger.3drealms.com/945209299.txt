Where oh where is Planetcrap when you need it? There simply isn't anywhere good to debate with people online anymore. Certainly none with the caliber of the average person who posted to PC.

/. is simply far too busy and annoying to weed through, and the various gaming page forums are well... not exactly full of people willing or able to make a real effort.

Does anybody have the old Planetcrap archives somewhere? There are some nifty threads from those "old" days that I would love to store away for 5-10 years and then look at again to see how right, and how wrong we all were.

Thanks in advance. I hope someone kept them around and they weren't lost forever in the etherial void of the internet.

Wieder rolls despondently along...
