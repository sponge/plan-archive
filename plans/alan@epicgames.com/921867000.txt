 Well, March is here, and with it comes funtime!  Oh well, 
I'm looking forward to the games that are coming out this month
(though NONE more than C&C!!!)  If anyone out there has any info
on when its supposed to be released, lemme know!

This one's for RKJ... Yer name in lights, buddy, fwiw.


(Late)

Well, looking forward to seeing the Daikatana demo tonight! Hopefully
it'll be worth the wait.

 Jack seems to have got most of the bugs worked out of the .plan
service, so all the text SHOULD be displaying right now...

 For fans of Jay and Silent Bob, go to 
www.viewaskew.com/mtv/vstash/index.html and check out Jay and Silent
Bob's MTV commercials... I laughed by ass off the first time I 
caught some of these on TV!

 Whoa, another late night! Its amazing how many of these I've had
over the last six months ago, but playing the game lately has 
made it all worth it!!! We're playing more and more deathmatch
lately (partly testing, partly just because its SO damn fun),
and the laughing/screaming/volume levels are climbing steadily. 

 Very gratifying, especially when its yer own map :-)

Well, as is obvious by now, we've got our finger server working!
Congrats to Jack (Mek) Porter for getting the whole thing going. 
As I am a level designer, I don't have a lot of neato code info
to pass on, so basically I'm just going to dump random thoughts
into here from time to time.

Random Thought #1:  Never lick a monkey.  They don't wash, and
they get really upset when you try.
