Just finished a 20 min session on the wooden dummy. I'm a sweaty
mess of pulsy aching muscle right now. Anyhow, point: today I
decided to blast some music meanwhile and realized something
too far out to skip here. There's this one song by Ozzy called
'AVH' that I really like. Thing is, while this one was playing
I came to the realization that the words in the song could
easily be interpreted as the thoughts of a community developer,
or gamer for that matter.. that whole addiction to playing and
creating games, etc. 

I guess you have to read it in, but it's there.

Is it just me, or is it not a wicked coincidence? Downloaded the
lyrics, so here you go! Time to hit the shower!

"There is a pleasure, sure, in being mad, which none but
madmen know!"

- The Spanish Friar, I.i


AVH (by Ozzy)

i get up when i get down
i don't how to take it
oh the pain makes me scream and shout
wonder if i'll make it

i love the feeling
when the magic is just right
there's no revealing
what is hidden in the light

riding on a train that i can't control
no one else to blame but i can't let go
oh no

in the darkness i can feel
the things that make me crazy
hands of madness cold as steel
i find it quite amazing

never forsaking
what a dreamer needs to know
rules meant for breaking
and the seeds i have to sow

riding on the train that i can't control
no one else to blame but i can't let go
it's calling me
it's calling me

riding on a train that i can't control

fear no evil
fear no fright
never lose the feeling
keep the target in your site
never god revealing

never forsaking
what a dreamer needs to know
rules meant for breaking
and i gotta let
i gotta let it go

riding on a train that i can't control
no one else to blame but i can't let go
it's calling me
it's calling me

riding on a train that i can't control
