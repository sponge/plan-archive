Yesterday night I took some much needed time out to relax and
listen to music at home instead of pulling another sunday
night at the office. Finally got some use of of the home
electronics! Wifey and I went through some of my old 80's tape
collection and made some fresh MP3 files. Came across an old
favorite of ours, dunno if you remember Rob Halford and the
metal group Judas Priest.. but here's a bit from an excellent
tune of theirs, very inspirational!


in this world we're living in
we have our share of sorrow
answer now is: don't give in
aim for a new tomorrow!

If you think I'll sit around
as the world goes by
you're thinking like a fool
it's just a case of "do or die"
out there is a fortune
waiting to be had
if you think i'll let it go
you're mad:
you got another thing coming!


Gotta love it. ;)
