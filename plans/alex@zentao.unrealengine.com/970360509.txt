Saturday, Sept 30th, 2000


Today was a very relaxing change from the usual grind. Took
the wife, daughter, and mom out to the Eastern Townships,
and spent the first part of the day hiking at Mount Orford.

The colors this time of year up in the Townships are nothing
short of fantastic, I deserve a break like this more often.

Spent the latter half of the day at Stanstead College, where
I attended high school. Talk about a grand Alumni celebration!

This was the first time my 10 year old daughter Christina had
seen the grounds, and was just blown away by the grandeur of
it all. She'll be attending next year, so it was a great
chance for her to find out first hand just why I enjoyed my
time there so much. ;)
