Wanted to wish a speedy recovery to a good buddy of mine
Mathieu Lavoie who had a small operation on his foot yesterday.
He says it's not serious, but painful nevertheless, so..

Here's to you, Matt! Hope to see you back on your feet soon! ;)

OT:

A note for the idiotic Uscript hacker responsable for that
retarded "funbot". It's amazing how idiots always seem to find
a way to pervert good clean online competition into a stupid
f*cked up cheatfest. Anyone who's using it should be shot, and
the "coder" who subverted clean code to accomplish this feat of
absolute utter stupidity should be drawn and quartered. 

Watch your back, hack. You've made some powerful enemies.
