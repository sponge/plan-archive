Well the weekend is here and jeez TGIF. This season is just
killer.. resellers are going nuts!! Anyhow, I've decided to spend
each and every weekend at home this month .. am looking
forward to sleeping in tomorrow morning, is going to rock. 

How can you tell by my stunted vocabulary today that I haven't
slept for 2 days? LOL!

Repost: So far the pickings are slim, need someone with some
serious talent to take care of this asap, or we'll stick with
javascript menus exclusively (which sucks!):

Looking for a flash designer to convert the menuing system for
the zen tao website asap. Email nikki@zentao.unrealengine.com
or me at alex@zentao.unrealengine.com .. *DO NOT* include any 
files, just a simple url to your portfolio will be adequate.
