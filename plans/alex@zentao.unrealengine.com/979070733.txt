Here's one I'm learning for a show next month, this song
is very popular right now, and I'm just getting into it!

Call me late on the scene.. as long as you still call me!

Higher

When dreaming I'm guided to another world 
Time and time again 
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep 
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape 
From the life I live when I'm awake 
So let's go there 
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask can we stay? 

Can you take me Higher?
To a place where blind men see 
Can you take me Higher? 
To a place with golden streets

Although I would like our world to change 
It helps me to appreciate 
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights 
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same 
The only difference is 
To let love replace all our hate 
So let's go there 
Let's make our escape 
Come on, let's go there 
Let's ask can we stay? 

Can you take me Higher?
To a place where blind men see 
Can you take me Higher? 
To a place with golden streets

So lets go there, lets go there,
Come on, lets go there
Lets ask can we stay?

Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine 
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine 

Can you take me Higher?
To a place where blind men see 
Can you take me Higher? 
To a place with golden streets

Can you take me Higher?
To a place where blind men see 
Can you take me Higher? 
To a place with golden streets

-creed, higher
