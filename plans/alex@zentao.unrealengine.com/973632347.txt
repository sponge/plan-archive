A big pak sau to the head for Billy 'Wicked' who's said to
be enjoying his birthday today. Since Billy uses 2 jars of
Oil of Olay per day, there's no way to identify his real age
short of carbon dating or cutting him in half and counting
the rings like a tree. ;)

Pop by http://www.voodooextreme.com and wish him the best!

cheers!
