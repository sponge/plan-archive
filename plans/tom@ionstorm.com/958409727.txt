<p>Back from E3!
<hr>
<p>We won AGN's Best RPG of E3!  We got a cool award document and trophy which they are engraving to send to us!  Cool!
<p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid 2 looked AWESOME!  They just had a movie, but after it, they said it was "100% gameplay".  Holy cow!  It looked so rock.  That will be the killer app for the PS2.
<p>
<p>I also want Chrono Cross a LOT.  I only had about 15 minutes to check stuff out during the whole show, so there you go.
<p>
<p>Brushes with Stars: not much--I saw Downtown Julie Brown from 50 feet away.  Ooh!
<p>
<p>My voicebox is still recovering from the show, but I think we showed really well.  Now we're back and pumpin' on this puppy!
<p>
<p>What else...um, I have new tennis shoes.  Melissa, JoeSke and I had awesome creme brulee at the Chart House in LA...that's about it...
