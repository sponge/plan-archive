<hr>
<p>I remember a movie about the U.S. and some other country deciding that rather than lose millions of lives in a war, they would just have the best soldier from each side go to an island, and whichever soldier killed the other one would win the war for his country. I think it was a 70's movie...  HELP!

<p>Work is going well.  I'm doing the quests in three different levels at once, while simultaneously adding commands to APE.  The first command is assign, which allows easy assignment of many values to consecutive elements of an array.  The next two are loadarray and savearray, for simple I/O.  They will be cool.

<p>I still have to go get Vampire.  And my Legend of Mana came in.  And Fight Club DVD is out.  Aieeee!
