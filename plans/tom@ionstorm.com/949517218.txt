<p>We are looking for a Production Coordinator, someone to hover over the Project schedule and keep track of all the assets.  We've been doing it all right, but we need to focus on content, and as we get closer to shipping, PR needs more stuff from us, and so on!
<p>
<p>So we need someone who's worked on a published game, and is an expert at Project.  Don't bother if you don't have both of these qualities!  If you do, read on.

<p>In other news, finished Donkey 64.  It was fun.  Now I have Mario Party 2, Planescape: Torment, and Unreal Tournament, as if I have any time to play anything!
