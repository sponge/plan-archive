<p>We're in super mega heavy crazy crunch mode. I'm here seven days a week, tweakin', fixin', balancin'...
<p>
<p>Apart from the occasional late night "Unsolved Mysteries", I don't really have free time. So when I make my iced tea, I play a couple battles in Final Fantasy Legend on my Gameboy as the tea steeps.
<p>
<p>Anyway, I've lost my manual...does anyone know of any ASCII or graphical world maps for that old game?  It's just fun to have maps of those kinda games, especially since this one is sorta halfway between and FF and an Ultima... I used to painfully map out the whole world, tile for tile, in games like Ultima III.
<p>
<p>No time for that now...anyway, would be fun to see one if there's one out there -- a brief Web search yielded just a bunch of FAQs and walkthroughs.
<p>
<p>Okey doke...back at it!
<p>
<p>
<p>P.S. The characters blink, and have nice model lighting now.
<p>P.P.S. Lots of cool secrets in our game... heeeeee.
