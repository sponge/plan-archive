<p>You read that right! If there's enough fan support for the port, Squaresoft will do it.  (They already have it in Japanese.)
<p>
<p>So, even if you DON'T like RPGs, please write:  support@squaresoft.com  and tell them to put out Chrono Trigger PSX in the US!

<p>Pleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleaseplease!  IT MUST COME OUT!  IT MUST LIVE AGAIN!  PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE!
<p>
<p>Sorry.

<p>The Hive Demo we showed to the press seemed to go over well. We have cool parabolic environment mapping (things look chrome-like, and reflect what's around them). Looks cool.  Battles are fun, and the puzzles are kinda neat. And the dialogue is pretty dang funny. And the cinematics are too. And the WorldSkills are fun.  And...and...

<p>Working on finding gameflow bugs and balancing all the monsters and stuff!  </p>

<p>Chocobo Hot & Cold is fun.  I don't know when I'll finish the game, and I don't care. :)  Guess I'll finish it after I find all the treasures!
