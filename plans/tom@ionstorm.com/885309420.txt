Cray Oh La Boxes is out.  It may be ugly in places, it may be slow, but it is
done!  Get it at:


ftp://cdrom.com/pub/quake2/levels/deathmatch/a-c/craybox.zip

or at our own ZDim's Weapon Rack...

Don't know when it will post....  The next one will be prettier and faster.
This one was a great learning experience.

Working on level packs for Iikka and Larry.  Our new artist Lee Dotson likes
doing fonts (_I_ was doing them, for Pete's sake!) so I've handed off the
fonts duties to him.  Whew!

I'll be working on interface design with Lee Perry tomorrow.

Jake just did an imitation of DeNiro opening a package of meat, and Lee did
Bobcat Goldthwait opening a package of meeting.  I was gonna do Carol
Channing, but decided against it....

Huh, jeez.  Uh, hi.  Sorry, I'm late. <:^|

What's been going on?

--Had a great Christmas.  Six inches of snow in Wisconsin, family met Melissa,
  we all had a good time. La.
--Found a good home for my dog Potato.  We couldn't spend enough time with him
  so we found him a home where someone could be there all day.  He's much
  better off there.  Bye, Potato!
--Selling my house.  Too far away from work. And from anything fun.

Workwise, typed up the melee structure, the brawl mode, and other stuff,
did a re-think of the Elementor weapon system and it's pretty cool now.
Jake and Squirrel hammered on it, and only a few things didn't hold up
as elegant.  Cool.  I'll be working on a font, messing with the story,
and heading toward finishing the overall design in the next week or two.

Did a DM level for Quake 2.  All that's left is some prettier texturing and
the odd texture alignment.  It's pretty fun.  It is called "Cray Oh La Boxes".

Saw Titanic.  Pretty good, but I wish I wasn't in the computer industry,
'cause it's kinda easy to recognize the CG parts.  Ah, well.

Pretty soon (Feb. 2nd) we will be in the NEW SPACE!  Yes!  Squirrel may
actually return to normal human hygiene habits soon (there's a shower
within twenty feet of his desk).
   The space looks awesome and it's getting, er, awesomer every day.  The
best development space in the history of humankind!

Congrats to Cleaner--his hair is somewhat parallel today.

Had a good art/level designer meeting where we really hashed out how we want
to attack the massive data set for the game.  I think it is gonna work out
well. 

All the levels and textures look great!  They are pounding out cool enemy
models and stuff.  Brian and Jay are jumping on the level-texturing
bandwagon, and are choosing the level packs to join.  I'm really happy with
the art coming out of the art folks!  The textures, the models, the skies--
everything is turning out cooler that I dreamed.

Jake and I just reorganized the universe again in light of the new plot
changes, and now everything seems to make sense.  Whew!  It's hard to make
a change reflect itself and work with everything before.  Whew.  It really
makes everyone's intentions and goals more clear now too!

Cleaner is working on the lava planet, Rich on the spooky area, and Larry
on the cool technological one.  The new stuff is looking amazing.

The programmers are working hard on lots of stuff and anticipating the Quake
2 stuff.  I can't wait!  Something special is a-brewin'. :)

Lee, the lead artist, has come up with lots of brilliant stuff.  Ben's
drawings of the both the new and familiar characters are brilliant.

I have a lot of story revamping still to go, a revision of the MysTech
system, tuning of the character arcs, redoing the timeline, and lots of
other stuff.

Some day within the next few months, we'll start the screenshots.  We're
doing a number of really cool things that I don't want to spoil too early.
I know everyone is kind of dying for information...but it will be worth
waiting for once you see the cool stuff.  Trust me!

My dog Potato has chewed every loose item in the house.  Sigh.

Turned in an Anachronox milestone--Eidos LOVES it!  Everyone there is talking
about it.  They are all excited that we have a year to make this thing rock
even harder!  I was jumping up and down when it came together.  It looks and
sounds so cool.  Can't show it to anyone for a bit, but we are all really
excited here!  Wheeee!

Finalizing the controls and world stuff for Anachronox.  Things are getting
really awesome.  I haven't been this exciting in a long time.

Got a new dog.  His name is Potato.  He is mostly Basengi and a bit Chihuahua.
I'm not a huge Chihuahua fan, but this combo is SO cute.  He is light brown
and white, and doesn't bark--Basengis only occasionally whine, and when really
excited, they...yodel!  Wacky.  My friend Zoe helped pick Potato out and helped
me surprise Melissa with him.  Zoe am der bestes.  She visited for the weekend
and we had a wonderful time dancing and talking and having fun and talking.
La.

So life is really good--work is great, relationship is great, and just had a
visit from a close friend.  And I had brownies yesterday!  Woo!
=============================================================================
10/21/97
Blazing on our Anachronox milestone.  The levels are great and the models are
looking awesome.  The new Boots ROCKS.  He will be in in like five minutes!
Aaaaaah!

Happy Hours on Fridays have really worked out well.  We've had two and it's
a good way to end the week, hang with the rest of the team when we're not
bugging each other for stuff, play pool, share bar tricks, and have a ball.
We always wind up talking about work or the latest game, but then, we're
straight-up geeks at heart.

Changed the story to be much more immediate.  I realized I had this awesome,
shocking event, and it was happening in the past.  Now it happens during the
game and it blows you away.  Heh heh heh.

I have de new girlfriend now.  Her name is Melissa.  She is cool, pretty,
fun, smart and so on.  I like her bunches.

We are now working with a local band to do an awesome funk song for a scene
about a quarter through the game.  It is going to be hot.  They rock.  The
name of their band is "Drunken Monkey".   They rule.  I can't get their
song "Blind Ambition" out of my head.  Aieeee!

The offices upstairs are going to RULE!  We went up there last night--I can't
begin to describe how amazing they will be.  Wow.  It'll be like eating at
a gas station, then going to The Palm or Mr. Chow or something.  Such an
amazing quality difference!  Woo!

I feel really lucky that I have such cool people and talented people working
with me.  We've started to hit our groove and everyone's kicking in to high
gear.  Anachronox is going to be really cool.

We are working on a perspective change that's going to work out better than
the 30-degrees and back, absolute movement one.  It is going to work out a
lot better and open up a LOT of cool design elements to the game.

Hay-lo.  Just got back from our little press tour in San Francisco.  Met with
a number of magazines.  Had a pretty good time.  Arrived with two hours sleep
though!

Got to meet an idol of mine, Bill Budge.  He did a lot of great programs on
the Apple II, including Raster Blaster and Pinball Construction Set.  It
was cool to meet him.  His wife is nice, kids are cute, and his house is
nicely laid out.  We munched on Roundtable pizza and a salad his wife made
and got nostalgic.  Sigh.  He's a very nice dude.  Pleasure meeting him.

Had a great time meeting with Eidos and hanging out.  Really great dinner
at Ruth's Chris Steak House.  Never understood the name until now.  A lady
named Ruth bought a little steak house named Chris Steak House, and added
her name, regardless of how name-stumbly it seemed.  Awesome food, though!

We ended with the Wall Street Journal.  That was a cool interview.  I think
we all sort let loose since it was the last one, but then were a bit
conservative since it was the Wall Street Journal.  Odd combo, but it seemed
to work.

Went to see Romero get pummeled at the Microsoft Age of Empires release
party.  Lots of people there I recognized (id, Ritual, Rogue, Rob Huebner
from LucasArts, the cats from CGW).  John was down to one little boat, sort
of hiding in the sea, as the guy amassed his amazing forces (well, this was
Bruce Shelley, who WROTE the game, so...).  Anyway, John is in this
situation and types, "You're goin' down!"  Cool.  It was John's first time
playing the game. Hee!  Everyone was kind of advising him and stuff.

Work on Anachronox is coming along.  Just two more weeks til we're done with
the whole thing!

Just kidding. 8^.
=============================================================================

The rearranged Anachronox area is awesome.  We're all big one happy group,
a sweating mass synergy.

The levels are starting to look really cool, I've finished off the big
question sheet that Jake made, which was really helpful in asking those
hard questions about Anachronox.

We played D&D Saturday with Rich Carlson, ace level designer, as DM.  It
was Squirrel, Cleaner, Lee Perry (new Anachronox artist), and I waging
war.  I play a mage with one hit point. For some reason, I am amazingly
awesome wielding my staff, and I've almost been showing up the fighters!

Last week there were a number of interviews going on, and there are two new
sites being worked on for Anachronox: Anachronews and The Bricks.  They
are gonna be pretty cool.

Asnackronox is running low.  More Baked Lays!
=============================================================================
7/21/97
Holy cow.  I've been away a while, huh?  Well, we are doing Anachronox in Open
GL and it is going to be awesome.  The scenes can be more complex, and the
effects will be amazing!  

QuakeCon was fun--more because of the party I had Saturday night, though!  We
watched movies, played Charades, swam in my pool, and talked for hours.  It
was a total blast.  Tons of fun.  The week was especially fun due to the
visits from Audrey and Lori from our PR firm, and Tricia from Eidos.  A
memorable weekend full of wacky happenings.

Squirrel and I have some horrible sore throat and achy thing.  Hope it passes
soon.  It sucks.  Hope no one else got it.

The Anachronox Q&A at QuakeCon seemed to go well.  Many very good questions.
I know many people are going to love the game, but some people aren't going
to like the type of game it is.  I hope they can learn to like this style of
RPG--it is a powerful, fun way to play.  The biggest applause was for me
saying there may be violence and sexual content in Anachronox, but then I
added there would be a switch to turn it off, and someone said, "Well, no one
uses that!"  I'll provide it anyway.  I believe in the right of people to
choose, and I want everyone to play my game, not just the hard core gamers.
(Sorry, if you are one and want to feel c%l, but it'll get hardcore plenty
fast for ya!)

I ache the ache of the ages.
=============================================================================
5/20/97
Howdy folks.  The design doc is due Friday!  Aieeee!  Got a few enemies left
to do.  Almost lost a huge data table for MysTech weapons and level
balancing, but Jake got it back.  He rules.

Everyone's doing great now.  Some of the dudes are hopping on Daikatana for
a bit to help with tools and levels.  That's our flagship, so it is most
important.  The levels are getting pretty freakin' cool.

There is _so_ much in Anachronox.  It's the biggest game in a 3D engine I've
seen.

Everyone's getting nostalgic for Chrono Trigger and a lot of us are playing
it again.  I'll be doing that right after the design doc.  We all got
together one night and saved Lucca's mom.  Sniff, sniff.

I am so full of Sal's pizza I feel like an overfilled waterballoon.  Eeesh.

Larry Herring, Anachronox level designer, is working on Valley of the Rocket
Jumpers.  It's pretty cool, though more complex now than I had envisioned.
It may be pretty tough to master.

I brought in a snack cabinet, which we've named Asnackronox, a couch, which
is Anapronox, and a sleeping pad with sheet, which is lamely named Super
Anapronox for now.  Oh yeah, and a medicine basket, which is the Anachrodoc.
=============================================================================
5/7/97
The finger server is finally back up.  We are in the temp space in our new
building.  In a few months we will be in the final space, and it will be
wondrous.  We are simply enjoying having reliable power and air conditioning
right now.

John and I got to go to Skywalker Ranch.  It was _amazing_.  For those of
you amazingly out of the loop, that's where George Lucas makes his movies.
The architecture is gorgeous--Lucas wrote a fictional history of the valley,
with families moving in and out, and buildings actually look as if an
original structure was built, then added onto through different architectural
periods.  The main house was spectacular with an amazing library with a
stained glass dome for a roof, and glass cases with precious props from
Star Wars, Raiders, Last Crusade, and some classic silent movies.  Original
Norman Rockwell and Maxfield Parrish paintings decorate the walls.  The
Tech Building features a perfectly acoustically dead theater.  You yell,
"Hey!" and hear no echo.  I could go on and on (I saw Ben Burtt's bike,
for instance) but I'll probably do a whole Inside Tom's Brain on it.

Design doc is way over 400 pages.  It's getting crazy.  We have an estimate
of 448 NPCs in the universe.  Yikes.  I gotta get back to work!
