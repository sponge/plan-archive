<hr>
<p>Again this year, I beg of other gamemakers...STOP!
<p>
<p>I am playing Final Fantasy IX in my few spare moments. It's really fun!  Buuuuut...I also have Zelda 2, Banjo-Tooie, Shenmue, and Jet Grind Radio.
<p>
<p>There is NO WAY I will be able to play all of them. It hurts.  It physically hurts.  Sigh.
<p>
<p>And I didn't even mention Chrono Cross New Game +!  Aieeeeeeee!

<p>Or whoever fixed "Day Tripper" on the new "1" Beatles CD.  On "Past Masters", the lead guitar often sounded like it had dropouts, or the volume was changing or something. On this CD, the song sounds perfect. Thanks! I was getting bummed!

<p>The European Press Tour went well. People seemed to dig what we're doing a lot.  Now to finish!
<p>
<p>I'm polishing off the last of Rho's Analyze World Skill. It's fun.
<p>
<p>I take off tomorrow and Friday for Thanksgiving...then back to it! Everyone have a great Turkey Day!  (Or for our vegetarian buds, have some great Tofu Loaf!)</p>
