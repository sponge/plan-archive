MY CREZZY .PLAN



by Tom Hall

THE WAIT IS OVER

I dutifully saved my receipts...Legend of Mana...Threads of Fate...Chrono Cross... Once I had them all I sent them in...and waited.

Then the day finally came, and here I had it--a SQUARESOFT BACKPACK.  How cool!  I rip the package open...

It's kid size.

Such is life.

At least Chrono was fun.  Ending was kinda verbose, eh?

WORKO

Battles are lookin' spicy. My favorite MysTech attack right now is either PoisonStar or the final Nuts one...

The Verilent Hive assault mini-game is still pretty hard!  Must be decently easy to get through...

So many little fiddly things to do!  But the end result is worth it.  Must hide more secret stuff!  Hee.
