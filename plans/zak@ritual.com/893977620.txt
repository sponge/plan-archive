This is My First .plan Update. Do I get to use the Big Buttons?
It's a fine day here at the Ritual offices, hacking away at musik und sound. All I can say is that SiN will have as much audio as many films out there.  As much, but better, because the player will trigger pretty much everything...

Thus, a .plan file is born.
