Yesterday, MarkD, JimD ScottA and I were dining at Gators (nothing but top shelf!), and a marketing epiphany was had by all. It all started when Mark noticed that I was eating my Buffalo Chicken Strip & Fires basket with a fork. He commented that it looked like I was eating a salad... a fry salad.
And a franchise dream was born: Fry Salad... a salad consisting of French Fries and other materials. Here's the menu:

House Fry Salad (Fries, ketchup)
Waldorf Fry Salad (with almonds, raisinn, etc)
Caesar Fry Salad
Greek Fry Salad (fries, feta cheese, olives, etc)
Cobb Fry Salad (fries, ham, cheese, eggs)
Three Fry Salad (consisting of shoestring, curly, and spicy fries)
Chicken Fried Fry Salad
Chicken Fried Fry Fried Chicken Salad 
Potato Fry Salad (consisting of Fries and Mayonnaise)
Cole Slaw Fry Salad
Rainforest Fry Salad (potato fries, taro root fries, sweet potato fries)

Contact us soon about franchising opportunities... spaces are limited.

This is My First .plan Update. Do I get to use the Big Buttons?
It's a fine day here at the Ritual offices, hacking away at musik und sound. All I can say is that SiN will have as much audio as many films out there.  As much, but better, because the player will trigger pretty much everything...

Thus, a .plan file is born.
