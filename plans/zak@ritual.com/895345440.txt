Well, it's been a productive stint here in Dallas... SiN is starting to look and sound great.
The sound system we'll be using for interactive music is great; it's feeling very movie-like.  I've tried to make the music for SiN proactive in a movie soundtrack way.  The right flavors in a soundtrack can really highten the plot and visual impact of a game.
I've received a few inquiries about the gear I use to make the music and sounds.  Here's a quick rundown:
Keyboards:
Kurzweil K2000R, Korg DSS-1, Roland S-50, various synth modules
Music Sequencer: Studio Vision Pro for Mac
Sound Design: Everything under the sun. Really.
Computers: PowerMac and a Pentium system.
