Some of you voted for me to join the board of the IGDA (International Game Developers Association), a position I am grateful to serve.

We've just re-launched the IGDA website, http://www.igda.org, if you're at all interested in game development then this is a great site to bookmark and visit for the forums and news.

My stance to sneak onto the board was wanting to look ahead and make it easier for new people in the industry to come in at all levels, and understand what it is we do without having to go on such a critical "trial by fire" of their first game.

One of my ideas there is my oft-talked-about, not-yet-done, public game development.  I still want to pursue this as game design remains a strong passion for me, and making something real through a group seems to be a good way to run people through the process.

Anyway, this process will probably be something I now want to do through the IGDA, allowing IGDA members (hey, joining the IGDA is good for you!) to see the process in action.

But not quite yet...  there's a lot of work out there this month for me.  Between Apple stuff, Wolf, DOOM, and Q3A engine stuff I need to grow more fingers and a second brain.  Kinda like John (although I think John has the faster processor).

Graeme.
