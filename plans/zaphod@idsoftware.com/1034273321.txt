Mac Point Release 1.32


Mouse slowdown on exit.  This is an Apple bug.  I reset the original scaling back using the appropiate command (NXGetMouseScaling/NXSetMouseScaling), but the reset isn't working.  I'll make it a cvar option to disable the OS X scaling until Apple fixes it.

Punkbuster support requires three external files which are provided by Even Balance, not id software.  I don't have the source to the PunkBuster stuff and our contact there is on vacation for two weeks.

I'll check out the mods that don't work asap.

Since OS X leaves the keyboards as "device independent" I'll double up the ESC key for the console.

Keypad Enter is fixed.  French keypad "," is added.
