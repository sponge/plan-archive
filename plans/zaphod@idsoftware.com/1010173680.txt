Man, do people watch that id ftp server or what..  Didn't get a chance to update before
it's on the news sites!

Quake 3 1.31 for OS X has been posted on the id ftp site.  We don't have the benefit of
outside testing for OS X builds, so it is a BETA release (ie. use at your own risk).

Fixed:
	-	stereo sound
	-	works every time on powerbooks
	-	mouse stays accelerated when you quit
	-	some dual monitor stuff

You need to have Quake 3 1.30 installed for OS X before you update to this build of 1.31
since only the updated pak files are included.

I've not built Classic Q3A 1.31 yet.  I seem to have accidently nuked my install of
CodeWarrior.
