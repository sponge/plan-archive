The Quake 3 Master Server

Due to an ongoing flood attack on the authorize server the
master server got super slow on responding.  For a few weeks
we've noticed that it was less than solid, but it wasn't
until investigation that the cause was found.  Apologies for
this.

I'm working on the issue right now, so the master server may
appear down today for a few hours starting right about now.

Graeme.
