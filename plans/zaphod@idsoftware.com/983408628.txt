Quick update!

You need to have all the current pak files to use this update (pak0->pak5), if you're at all concerned about whether or not you have them, or don't know what to look for, then please wait for the installer version.

I've been a bit preoccupied with the Tokyo keynote demo this last month.  But I have made a new Classic build today.  It's located at:

I love how iDisk is integrated into OS X!!

What's done.  This is using the new Metrowerks compiler which seems excellent.  It should run as well as or better than previous builds.

What's not done.  The sound code is still taking up more CPU time than it should, this is a Quake code issue I'll resolve quickly.

What's not there.  The altivec enhanced version and the OS X build.  I've not had time yet to build those and update them.  The OS X work done for the keynote address demo in Tokyo pulls directly across to the OS X Q3A build, so it should be very straightforward.

Given the beta hardware, daily builds of OS X, hourly patch dumps for the GF3 OpenGL driver, and content/code changes from id, the keynote build ran exceptionally well.  We did not have time to completely optimize for PPC or OS X, as I understand more and more about PPC and Altivec programming, I'm seeing more and more opportunities.
