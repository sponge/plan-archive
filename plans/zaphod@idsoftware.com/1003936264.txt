Busy busy days.  But what are busy days without some fun.

Long term plan readers, okay, the few of you who know me, okay Geoff I'm talking to you here, will remember that I love the Dungeon Keeper series of games.  Well, call me a Durillian Quasar Hog but I've found a new game along the same lines.  Startopia from Mucky Foot!  This game is awesome!  I've been up all night!

Anyway, if you liked DK, go check it out.

Oh, and it's got Hitchhiker like humor..  :-)
