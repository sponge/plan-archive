Just read the PQ article.  Yes, that was an awesome game, I think it was a little
closer than the score indicated.  We're itching for a rematch!  I've never had
a game with so many excellents and impressives over my head, and for it to
take a full 50 minutes was something else, it was truly riveting.

BTW, I didn't mean we're not going to play CTF vs. anyone anymore, just that
we're not playing right now.  We have to do some work sometimes!

1/21/98

Okay, we're not playing CTF anymore.

1/20/98

id vs. the world ctf at 192.246.40.223.  id is red, world is blue.

Mr Elusive just put together some bot editing documents, the file is available
on our ftp server:

ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/tools/Q3ABotEdit.zip

We've been following the whole DLL vs. VM debates, and id is firmly on the side
of using VMs for game mods.  We will be addressing the "auto swap" VM
depending on which server you go to quickly (this was a bug) but I think we
will be strict on saying that people should use VMs over DLL files.  The next
executable release will probably have a warning screen come up that you will
need to agree to and click through if the game is about to load a DLL.

Okay.  I see a lot of people with awaiting CD Key authorization questions.

In almost all cases, this is due to the IP address of the authorize server
being wrong because the hosts file on the client has somehow been altered.
You can test to see if this is your problem by going to a DOS prompt and
typing the following:

ping authorize.quake3arena.com

If you get the following, then your system has an invalid entry somewhere
redirecting the authorize requests to the wrong IP address.

If youre running Windows 95/98, then in almost every case editing the file
called hosts which resides in your c:\windows (or wherever youve installed
windows) directory and removing any lines that mention
authorize.quake3arena.com can fix this.

Various cracks and CD key gen utilities (none of which actually work) appear
to be the culprit, adjusting your hosts file without your knowledge or
consent.

While I've been out with the rest of the world trying to get a Barbie Cash
Register for my daughter, I have actually been doing a bit of work!

Activision's release QA process found two bugs in the Mac build that I felt
important enough to fix.  One bug was in the client, and the other in the
installer.

I fixed them both last night and Activision has a new master candidate.

I've heard sporadic reports that the Mac demo has problems, but I've yet
to be able to repeat that issue here.

I'll update my plan file today with the [long] list of things we're addressing
for the point release (yes, we've fixed the scoreboard).

12/16/99

Mac demo will be out tonight.  Mac full version is also complete.

Churn time.  We define Churn as the number of unique people that authorize
in a five-minute period.  At peak now were at around 1700 people in a five-minute
period, and at off peak were at 500.  Peak is around 5pm-11pm and off-peak is
8am until about noon.  As we get more international I expect this to level out.

Weve been testing Q3A for Y2K compliance.  Heres the results:

1.	Power failed due to Y2K glitch.

Q3A does not run if the power has failed because of a Y2K glitch.  Multiple
attempts to bring the computer on using a series of car batteries and two lines
of tin Q3A boxes did bring the computer up for a second, but the resulting fire
and damage to the building did not allow us to recommend this solution.  We
apologize to Rogue for using their office and cars to test this.

2.	Computer has crashed because of a Y2K glitch.

Q3A does not run if the computer has failed.  Installation of a different OS could be
the recommended solution, but the Y2K glitch had caused the computer to unrepentantly
jump out the window in a vain attempt to continue crashing.  We apologize to Rogue for
using their computers to complete this test.

3.	The worlds nuclear arsenal goes off because of a Y2K glitch.

Q3A does not survive a nuclear war, although the authorize server will continue to run.
Actually, we were unable to test this.  Were just guessing.  We really dont want to test
this out, so well just it as golden that wed be in big trouble if this happened.

4.	The Internet fails because of a Y2K glitch.

Q3A continues to run single player just fine, however, multi-player over the Internet could
not startup due to a general TCP/IP error.  With Ebay failing because of this as well the
entire US economy would freefall into the cold Atlantic Ocean allowing the alien race hiding
on the dark side of the moon to finally begin their insidious campaign of marketing 366 days
until 2001 memorabilia.

5.	The coffee machines around the world fail because of a Y2K glitch.

There is no possible worse scenario than this, the lack of Java in the world would seriously
undermine the Sun and cause the Earth to plummet into the cold and freeze the entire planet.
Starbucks would continue to thrive on selling everything else it produces and actually become
more profitable since there would be more throughput at the cash register, but since all the
customers would be dead they would relocate to a parallel dimension that voted to keep the
date 1999 for just a few more years.

6.	John Carmack fails because of a Y2K glitch.

We have 200 John Carmack clones hidden at secure sites around a small Idaho potato
farm (potatoes are considered Y2K compliant by all except the French, who insist that potatoes
will spontaneously explode at 4:31am, 1-1-00 ).  Dont worry.  Weve covered this base.

12/10/99

Okay.  Im now officially overloaded on email.

Were looking to get the tools out there very soon for creating Q3A modifications.
Well probably do a point release on the product before we release anything, and
weve been busy writing (gosh) documentation for the editor, shaders, etc.  Im
really looking forward to seeing what you guys do with Q3A!

Were now cracking down on people using key generators.  We stop accepting input
for a period of time from addresses that spam different keys to the authentication
server.  I see a lot of people running key generators right now; Ive yet to see a single
one make a correct key.

We will also probably alter the key generation scheme on subsequent runs of the
product so we can verify mistyped keys within the client.  This remains our biggest
issue and if we can cure it right at the input step, then well go a long way towards
easing this up.

12/08/99

Cracked servers are no longer listed through the master.  We're tracking these servers.  We
know your IP address, so if you have one running, I strongly suggest you take it down immediately.

12/06/99

Okay.  First off, don't run crack executables on your client!  All it's likely to do is grab
your CD key and send it off somewhere.  Authorization is server side, not client side.  We will
pursue and close down cracked servers with all available resources.

Secondly, CD keys are "leased", so if you log on through a dialup, play, then disconnect your
modem and log right back on, your CD key will have to timeout on your previous IP before you
can play again.  This timeout period is currently set at 5 minutes.

12/06/99

Okay.  Hacker attempts with invalid keys are outnumbering real keys by a factor of 2:1 or so.

Obviously this is somewhat validating the use of CD keys.

So far I've seen issues with the servers being able to see the auth server and clients using
IP forwarding not having the correct setup on the IP forwarding server.  If it's a Linux IP
forwarding machine use something like:

modprobe ip_masq_quake ports=26000,27000,27910,27960,27950,27951,27952

Modulating characters within a key sequence will not work.  It appears to work because when
you've validated your IP with an authentic CD key you've "leased" that IP address for a period
of time.  Even if you enter a junk string, that will work because your IP address is still valid.

The actual algorithm is a 64 bit DES key encryption method open to a very small window.  The
chances of coming up with a real valid key is in the range of billions and billions to one.  A random
pass through the available keys shows no sign of repeating sequences, it looks like good old chaos
(in fact, statisical math proves this).

The client has no idea if your key is really valid or not, it just checks on the correct characters
being entered.  

12/03/99

Why do I get booted back to the main menu?

It's because you've got a 1.11 client and you're trying to join a 1.09 (demo test) pure server.
Since the protocol # is exactly the same, you see all the 1.09 servers in the browser,
but when you try and join the game you get booted because you aren't "pure".

We'll switch off support for 1.09 listings in the browser once 1.11 demo is out for the
Mac and Linux.  Meanwhile there's not much I can do since I can't tell from the client
side if you're a 1.09 or 1.11 client asking for list of available servers.

12/03/99

IMPORTANT!!!!!

You MUST enter your CD key in lower case letters.  If you do this through the menu
it's automatic, but if you set it from the console, upper case letters will not work.

IMPORTANT!!!!!

12/03/99

If you get a CD Key error, please check to make sure you have the CD Key correctly
entered.  I've seen a few people go by and be denied on what looks like a valid key
that's just been typed in wrong.

12/03/99

The demo has gone final and will be available through Sandpiper in a few hours.

I've gotten a lot of feedback from people regarding the use of authentication servers. 
Yes, John Carmack has a nice car from his hard work, but unfortunately software piracy
has become such a serious issue that we need to use schemes such as CD keys to protect
our future sales.  Games cost large sums of money to make and market, and if you want to
have software developers continue to develop games then piracy, understanding it, and
addressing it, needs to be part of the development process.

Digital satellite receivers each ship with a little crypto card to uniquely number the
machine  Dish Network and DirecTV make sure they get their money every month!  DVD
encryption swayed Hollywood to produce high quality digital content that we as nerds
lavished our money on, piracy of DVDs has not been an issue because of such encryption,
but now this has been broken and may affect the future of DVD, already its reported that
DVD Audio has been delayed.  When Intel introduced a software accessible serial number
with the Pentium III it was quickly disabled because of public backlash, yet its very function
was to protect against piracy and allow security.

So with computers were stuck with freedom, which isnt all that bad.  How many of us (Linux
crowd hush please) run 100% piracy free machines?  Does occasional use count?  If I only
used it once to repartition my drive do I have to pay for Partition Magic?  Isnt Winzip part
of Microsoft?  Were hypocrites if we cheer the Government ruling against Microsoft for including
so much software free in their OS that we otherwise would use and never pay for.  Then again,
I love Java, Macs and OpenGL.  There are corporations out there who work hard to make sure
Im a minority.

Is piracy of id products the only way the community has prospered, grown and sustained itself
all these years?  Its true a certain number of you will always pirate a game and never make the
purchase.  But a whole bunch of you are raving, fanatical loyal id fans with money in one hand
and EB on speed dial in the other to see if Q3A is in stock.  If you help the community by helping
to stamp out piracy, then I think youll see that the community will be just fine and who knows,
software prices might fall, Doom 2000 might come out, or the Y2K bug may not burn us all.

So yes.  Use a SOCKS server (we will authenticate multiple CD Keys off a single IP), open up those
ports on your firewall (you can resolve master.quake3arena.com and just use that IP address),
but please dont belie our intentions.  Well work extremely hard, 24 hours a day, to mak
