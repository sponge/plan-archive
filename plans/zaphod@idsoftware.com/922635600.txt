3/28/99

I know a lot of you are looking at the end of the month as a fixed date for q3test,
but we're probably looking to be within a few weeks of that date rather than exactly
on it.  We're working on it; I just want to keep expectations in line with reality.

This is a test of Quake 3:Arena, not the demo.  With this test we're looking to see
how well the brand new networking and graphics code works, and while we've run this
through a QA process here and at Activision, this is not code that is of release
quality in speed or gameplay.  Please do not look upon this as the "demo" of Q3A.

Thanks.  I now return you to your regular programming.

Xian says I need to put something new here.

It's been a busy two weeks, and I've yet to get any furniture.

Thoughts later.
