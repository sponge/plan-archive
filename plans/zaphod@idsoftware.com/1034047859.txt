Mac Point Release 1.32

I have been working hard on the Mac point release.  I am currently experiencing extreme performance degradation of the application running under OS X 10.2, with that in mind, and the 7fps frame rate, the app is not worth releasing until the issue is fixed.  I 100% believe this is our issue, not an issue with the OS, since previous Q3A builds are running just fine under 10.2.  Due to an internal misunderstanding I did not have correct source until today.

I apologize, and am working diligently on the issue.

Graeme.
