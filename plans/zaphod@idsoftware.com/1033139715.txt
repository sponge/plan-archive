Okay, this is all TOTALLY non-game, non-id related.

Farscape remains canceled.  We made a valiant effort to save a great show, but in the end it didn't work out.  SciFi channel moves one step closer to being the re-run channel and has turned it's back on the asset that garnered it awards and prestige.  Thank goodness other networks have picked up the intelligent SciFi mantle.  I guess it was too much to ask of a cable network baring the name SciFi to be an ongoing home for intelligent programming.

Onto other things.  Have you ever heard of SETI@home (http://setiathome.berkeley.edu)?  Well, I'd like to try a little experiment.  You see, there's a person I see out there that brags daily that he/she does the most SETI "units" per day.  And frankly, it's not about the "most", it's about the search.  So if you're up to it, I'd like to borrow a week of your SETI time and, umm, be childish and seeketh to show this person that anyone can be the "most".  So if you don't mind, point your user account to zaphod@idsoftware.com for just a week.  Thanks.

Yeah, that's about the extent of my Friday morning.  

Finally, and perhaps most importantly.  The IGDA has filed an amicus brief in support of the IDSA's appeal against the St. Louis Video Game Ordinance.  If you think what happened in Greece can't happen here, think again.  Head on over to http://www.igda.org for the full news and download the brief.  Better yet, show your support by joining the IGDA.
