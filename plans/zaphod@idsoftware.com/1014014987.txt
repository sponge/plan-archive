The Quake 3 Master Server

Everything seems to have been smooth for the past 24 hours.

We've replaced the master server hardware, changed the software to be
(hopefully) more attack proof, and separated out the processes so that
if one is attacked heavily the others will be okay.  We've weathered
attacks before, but each one is always an education.

I got a bunch of emails on people with routers not being able to connect.
When the authorize server is down the game server automatically authorizes
all clients, this is why people attack the authorize server to bring it down.
The only way you can get a denied to connect from the game server is when
the authorize server sends that packet to the game server, when there is
no authorize server, the game server errs on the side of caution and lets
everyone play.

The solution of setting your hosts file to 127.0.0.1 for the various id masters
will cause a few things.  You will no longer be able to get the in-game browser
to work, and worst of all you will not be able to play on game servers that you
connect to because the game server will get a deny packet from the authorize
server (because you sent your cdkey to 127.0.0.1).

Thanks to everyone who helped me test these past 48 hours.

Graeme.
