I've gotten many emails regarding Q3A for Mac OS X Public Beta.  Yes, we're working on
a build, but it will go hand in hand with the forthcoming point release.  All Mac users
will notice a significant speed increase with this point release (when showing it to
Apple they said "woah, how'd you do that?")

I've also gotten lots of emails about an older game of mine, The 7th Guest.  Trilobyte
still exists as an entity and holds all the IP/distribution rights to 7th Guest, 11th Hour
etc.  You can still purchase Clandestiny from the Trilobyte web page (www.tbyte.com).  I'm
sure at some point there will be another Guest game, but right now I'm having way too much
fun at id which remains a rockingly good place to work at.

Back from MacWorld, and quite the MacWorld is was too.  Gotta love the cube!

Walking around the show floor and talking to the various Mac developers and publishers 
it's clear that the level of support Apple is providing across the game community is making 
a huge and positive difference.  I've worked with Apple on and off for 12 years or so (since 
7th Guest days, and before that when I was at Virgin), and within the last year have felt their 
presence as more and more of a partner in my endeavors to make this platform rock.  My 
thanks go out to Mike, Heather, Wallace and Geoff for their efforts above and beyond the 
call of duty, and I know a lot of other developers are there with me.  Apple is really
there for game developers right now.

I'll be adding the SMP support into Q3A and shipping a build off to Apple today.  We've 
already got that stubbed in there.

The platform is exceptional.  In the last 2 years Apple has sold 3.7 million iMacs (not 
including G4 and G3 towers).  That's one every 18 seconds.  Out of that, over 80% of 
those machines are on the Internet.  When Apple launched iMovie, the digital video editing 
software for the iMac, they found that over 45% of those with iMacs capable of using 
iMovie were using it.  These are incredible figures.

7/16/00

Ah, off to New York for Mac World.  We've got a nice surprise there for everyone.

If anyone wants to get together out there, I'd be happy to sit down over a
Guinness and talk.  I've worked in Mac OS X DP4 since WWDC, and have lived well.

6/9/00

We're moving office today.  Of course, various forces have collected to ensure that
our T3 line is not moving over smoothly, so Xian has had his hands full (well, mostly
his ear on his phone) getting things lined up.

We will be installing a second master/auth/motd server at the new office so that when
the switch happens, things //should// go smoothly.  Of course, things //may// not
go smoothly, in which case, the master server will be down.  If the auth server goes
down, all servers automatically authenticate, so the worst case scenario is that the
in game browser will report no response from the master.

5/9/00

Just finished a final MacQuake3 fix for Q3F and other mods.  It should be up and
around soon (it needs the latest point release to run).  If any other mods had compile
issues on the Mac, then this patch should fix it as well.

I'm off to E3 tomorrow, and then onto WWDC.  Hopefully I'll see some of you at E3 and
WWDC.

5/8/00

If anyone out there wants to try my new MacQuake3 fix quick for playing Quake 3
Fortress on a Mac, drop me an email (next 30 minutes).

5/8/00

Well, E3 is coming right on up!

John Cash departed from id last Friday to a new position at Blizzard.  I'll let him
fill you in on what he's doing there, but we miss his CTF skills already!  We wish
John all the best, and id looks forward to the forthcoming Diablo II beta copies..

:)

Had to throw that in.

5/5/00

The mission pack CD will actually have builds for Mac, Linux and Win32.  We'll see
if we can stick some OS/X action in there as well..

5/3/01

50 million MOTD messages since the beginning of the year!

Okay, so if I have the math right, that's around 5 game startups per second 24/7!

This is one thing that disturbs me about stats.  Churn through in games like Q3A is
obviously huge, but gameplay time is obviously smaller than other games like Everquest,
so how do we measure?

Merge 93.3 was here the other morning, of course, we destroyed them in deathmatch, but
since then I've listened to them online a bunch (www.merge933.net) and feel the need
to plug.

4/5/99

id has a Q3F server up at 192.246.40.127, id is red, world is blue.

3/21/98

Okay.  X-Files back on track.

I've been thinking a lot about this whole idea of giving out degrees in game
design, and it seems that thereصs a genuine need to be pro active in bringing
new people into the community and teaching them some of our mysterious ways.
What I'd like to look at doing for those people not enrolled in game design
courses at school (who teaches those anyway?) is to start a small skunk works
inside id that has active ongoing support from a few people here, a small
budget, and actively encourages and teaches our trade.

A lot of us (myself included) started out coding in the bedroom and things like
game design documents, schedules, and team coordination were not exactly things
we looked at making or doing because back then no one did.  Nowadays if you want
to make it in the commercial biz of games you've got to be very savvy at
producing a game design that's coherent, conveys the message clearly and
concisely to the team, and has set goals that can scheduled.

Anyway, I'd like to propose that our new skunk works helps out by helping the
game design process, looking at maps, looking at code, and communicating
directly between us, other developers, and the community at large.  It's only in
our best interests to pass on knowledge, get input and give input on what we're
doing, and help make this industry grow.

Thoughts?

2/28/97

X-Files.  I like X-Files.  I didnt like the episode last night -- in fact it 
was awful.

Mr. Gibson, if you want to come down to id and hang out and see how a real
developer makes games you are most welcome.  Heck, you can even help out
on ids next game thereby staying here long enough to get our culture.

2/17/96

The pre-release of the alpha for the forthcoming beta of the pre-build of the
next point release should be out tonight.  Details to follow from Robert Duffy.

2/09/97

Doing a real .plan thing.

I'm looking for a video sequence of high resolution lossless digital images that
we can use in some experiments we've got going here at id.  Up until now we've
been using the in-house rendered stuff, which is great, but I've previously used
some nice standard sources that really test things out like compression and 
color
space conversion issues.  Any pointers would be appreciated.

2/03/1009999e+7

id vs. the world ctf at 192.246.40.223.  id is red, world is blue.

1/21/97

Just read the PQ article.  Yes, that was an awesome game, I think it was a 
little
closer than the score indicated.  We're itching for a rematch!  I've never had
a game with so many excellents and impressives over my head, and for it to
take a full 50 minutes was something else, it was truly riveting.

BTW, I didn't mean we're not going to play CTF vs. anyone anymore, just that
we're not playing right now.  We have to do some work sometimes!

1/21/98

Okay, we're not playing CTF anymore.

1/20/98

id vs. the world ctf at 192.246.40.223.  id is red, world is blue.

1/17/99

Mr Elusive just put together some bot editing documents, the file is available
on our ftp server:

ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/tools/Q3ABotEdit.zip

We've been following the whole DLL vs. VM debates, and id is firmly on the side
of using VMs for game mods.  We will be addressing the "auto swap" VM
depending on which server you go to quickly (this was a bug) but I think we
will be strict on saying that people should use VMs over DLL files.  The next
executable release will probably have a warning screen come up that you will
need to agree to and click through if the game is about to load a DLL.

1/14/99

Okay.  I see a lot of people with awaiting CD Key authorization questions.

In almost all cases, this is due to the IP address of the authorize server
being wrong because the hosts file on the client has somehow been altered.
You can test to see if this is your problem by going to a DOS prompt and
typing the following:

ping authorize.quake3arena.com

If you get the following, then your system has an invalid entry somewhere
redirecting the authorize requests to the wrong IP address.

If youre running Windows 95/98, then in almost every case editing the file
called hosts which resides in your c:\windows (or wherever youve installed
windows) directory and removing any lines that mention
authorize.quake3arena.com can fix this.

Various cracks and CD key gen utilities (none of which actually work) appear
to be the culprit, adjusting your hosts file without your knowledge or
consent.

1/12/99

I just finished making the Macintosh point beta release.  It'll be on the usual 
mirrors
soon.

12/21/99

12/21/99

While I've been out with the rest of the world trying to get a Barbie Cash
Register for my daughter, I have actually been doing a bit of work!

Activision's release QA process found two bugs in the Mac build that I felt
important enough to fix.  One bug was in the client, and the other in the
installer.

I fixed them both last night and Activision has a new master candidate.

I've heard sporadic reports that the Mac demo has problems, but I've yet
to be able to repeat that issue here.

I'll update my plan file today with the [long] list of things we're addressing
for the point release (yes, we've fixed the scoreboard).

12/16/99

Mac demo will be out tonight.  Mac full version is also complete.

12/14/99

Churn time.  We define Churn as the number of unique people that authorize
in a five-minute period.  At peak now were at around 1700 people in a five-
minute
period, and at off peak were at 500.  Peak is around 5pm-11pm and off-peak is
8am until about noon.  As we get more international I expect this to level out.

Weve been testing Q3A for Y2K compliance.  Heres the results:

1.	Power failed due to Y2K glitch.

Q3A does not run if the power has failed because of a Y2K glitch.  Multiple
attempts to bring the computer on using a series of car batteries and two lines
of tin Q3A boxes did bring the computer up for a second, but the resulting fire
and damage to the building did not allow us to recommend this solution.  We
apologize to Rogue for using their office and cars to test this.

2.	Computer has crashed because of a Y2K glitch.

Q3A does not run if the computer has failed.  Installation of a different OS 
could be
the recommended solution, but the Y2K glitch had caused the computer to 
unrepentantly
jump out the window in a vain attempt to continue crashing.  We apologize to 
Rogue for
using their computers to complete this test.

3.	The worlds nuclear arsenal goes off because of a Y2K glitch.

Q3A does not survive a nuclear war, although the authorize server will continue 
to run.
Actually, we were unable to test this.  Were just guessing.  We really dont 
want to test
this out, so well just it as golden that wed be in big trouble if this 
happened.

4.	The Internet fails because of a Y2K glitch.

Q3A continues to run single player just fine, however, multi-player over the 
Internet could
not startup due to a general TCP/IP error.  With Ebay failing because of this as 
well the
entire US economy would freefall into the cold Atlantic Ocean allowing the alien 
race hiding
on the dark side of the moon to finally begin their insidious campaign of 
marketing 366 days
until 2001 memorabilia.

5.	The coffee machines around the world fail because of a Y2K glitch.

There is no possible worse scenario than this, the lack of Java in the world 
would seriously
undermine the Sun and cause the Earth to plummet into the cold and freeze the 
entire planet.
Starbucks would continue to thrive on selling everything else it produces and 
actually become
more profitable since there would be more throughput at the cash register, but 
since all the
customers would be dead they would relocate to a parallel dimension that voted 
to keep the
date 1999 for just a few more years.

6.	John Carmack fails because of a Y2K glitch.

We have 200 John Carmack clones hidden at secure sites around a small Idaho 
potato
farm (potatoes are considered Y2K compliant by all except the French, who insist 
that potatoes
will spontaneously explode at 4:31am, 1-1-00 ).  Dont worry.  Weve covered 
this base.

12/10/99

Okay.  Im now officially overloaded on email.

Were looking to get the tools out there very soon for creating Q3A 
modifications.
Well probably do a point release on the product before we release anything, and
weve been busy writing (gosh) documentation for the editor, shaders, etc.  Im
really looking forward to seeing what you guys do with Q3A!

Were now cracking down on people using key generators.  We stop accepting input
for a period of time from addresses that spam different keys to the 
authentication
server.  I see a lot of people running key generators right now; Ive yet to see 
a single
one make a correct key.

We will also probably alter the key generation scheme on subsequent runs of the
product so we can verify mistyped keys within the client.  This remains our 
biggest
issue and if we can cure it right at the input step, then well go a long way 
towards
easing this up.

12/08/99

Cracked servers are no longer listed through the master.  We're tracking these 
servers.  We
know your IP address, so if you have one running, I strongly suggest you take it 
down immediately.

12/06/99

Okay.  First off, don't run crack executables on your client!  All it's likely 
to do is grab
your CD key and send it off somewhere.  Authorization is server side, not client 
side.  We will
pursue and close down cracked servers with all available resources.

Secondly, CD keys are "leased", so if you log on through a dialup, play, then 
disconnect your
modem and log right back on, your CD key will have to timeout on your previous 
IP before you
can play again.  This timeout period is currently set at 5 minutes.

12/06/99

Okay.  Hacker attempts with invalid keys are outnumbering real keys by a factor 
of 2:1 or so.

Obviously this is somewhat validating the use of CD keys.

So far I've seen issues with the servers being able to see the auth server and 
clients using
IP forwarding not having the correct setup on the IP forwarding server.  If it's 
a Linux IP
forwarding machine use something like:

modprobe ip_masq_quake ports=26000,27000,27910,27960,27950,27951,27952

Modulating characters within a key sequence will not work.  It appears to work 
because when
you've validated your IP with an authentic CD key you've "leased" that IP 
address for a period
of time.  Even if you enter a junk string, that will work because your IP 
address is still valid.

The actual algorithm is a 64 bit DES key encryption method open to a very small 
window.  The
chances of coming up with a real valid key is in the range of billions and 
billions to one.  A random
pass through the available keys shows no sign of repeating sequences, it looks 
like good old chaos
(in fact, statisical math proves this).

The client has no idea if your key is really valid or not, it just checks on the 
correct characters
being entered.  

12/03/99

Why do I get booted back to the main menu?

It's because you've got a 1.11 client and you're trying to join a 1.09 (demo 
test) pure server.
Since the protocol # is exactly the same, you see all the 1.09 servers in the 
browser,
but when you try and join the game you get booted because you aren't "pure".

We'll switch off support for 1.09 listings in the browser once 1.11 demo is out 
for the
Mac and Linux.  Meanwhile there's not much I can do since I can't tell from the 
client
side if you're a 1.09 or 1.11 client asking for list of available servers.

12/03/99

IMPORTANT!!!!!

You MUST enter your CD key in lower case letters.  If you do this through the 
menu
it's automatic, but if you set it from the console, upper case letters will not 
work.

IMPORTANT!!!!!

12/03/99

If you get a CD Key error, please check to make sure you have the CD Key 
correctly
entered.  I've seen a few people go by and be denied on what looks like a valid 
key
that's just been typed in wrong.

12/03/99

The demo has gone final and will be available through Sandpiper in a few hours.

I've gotten a lot of feedback from people regarding the use of authentication 
servers. 
Yes, John Carmack has a nice car from his hard work, but unfortunately software 
piracy
has become such a serious issue that we need to use schemes such as CD keys to 
protect
our future sales.  Games cost large sums of money to make and market, and if you 
want to
have software developers continue to develop games then piracy, understanding 
it, and
addressing it, needs to be part of the development process.

Digital satellite receivers each ship with a little crypto card to uniquely 
number the
machine  Dish Network and DirecTV make sure they get their money every month!  
DVD
encryption swayed Hollywood to produce high quality digital content that we as 
nerds
lavished our money on, piracy of DVDs has not been an issue because of such 
encryption,
but now this has been broken and may affect the future of DVD, already its 
reported that
DVD Audio has been delayed.  When Intel introduced a software accessible serial 
number
with the Pentium III it was quickly disabled because of public backlash, yet 
its very function
was to protect against piracy and allow security.

So with computers were stuck with freedom, which isnt all that bad.  How many 
of us (Linux
crowd hush please) run 100% piracy free machines?  Does occasional use count?  
If I only
used it once to repartition my drive do I have to pay for Partition Magic?  
Isnt Winzip part
of Microsoft?  Were hypocrites if we cheer the Government ruling against 
Microsoft for including
so much software free in their OS that we otherwise would use and never pay for.  
Then again,
I love Java, Macs and OpenGL.  There are corporations out there who work hard to 
make sure
Im a minority.

Is piracy of id products the only way the community has prospered, grown and 
sustained itself
all these years?  Its true a certain number of you will always pirate a game 
and never make the
purchase.  But a whole bunch of you are raving, fanatical loyal id fans with 
money in one hand
and EB on speed dial in the other to see if Q3A is in stock.  If you help the 
community by helping
to stamp out piracy, then I think youll see that the community will be just 
fine and who knows,
software prices might fall, Doom 2000 might come out, or the Y2K bug may not 
burn us all.

So yes.  Use a SOCKS server (we will authenticate multiple CD Keys off a single 
IP), open up those
ports on your firewall (you can resolve master.quake3arena.com and just use that 
IP address),
but please dont belie our intentions.  Well work extreme
