Second Update:

There's a new build up.  It's marked BETA2.

Mouse movement is now back to normal.  The side effect of this is that the mouse isn't
staying accelerated when you quit the game again.  It shows it's accelerated in System
Preferences, but you need to reclick the position to make it happen.  Uggh.  I really
really really call the system functions to put the settings back.

You can now switch out of the app as well.


------------------

Man, do people watch that id ftp server or what..  Didn't get a chance to update before
it's on the news sites!

Quake 3 1.31 for OS X has been posted on the id ftp site.  We don't have the benefit of
outside testing for OS X builds, so it is a BETA release (ie. use at your own risk).

Fixed:
	-	stereo sound
	-	works every time on powerbooks
	-	mouse stays accelerated when you quit
	-	some dual monitor stuff

You need to have Quake 3 1.30 installed for OS X before you update to this build of 1.31
since only the updated pak files are included.

I've not built Classic Q3A 1.31 yet.  I seem to have accidently nuked my install of
CodeWarrior.
