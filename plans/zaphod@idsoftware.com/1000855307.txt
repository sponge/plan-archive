There's a new OS X build of WolfMP up (build b3).  This fixes issues with dual monitors and some ATI Rage cards.  If it goes well I'll make up a full installer and we can get everyone in on the fun.

My heartfelt thanks to everyone out there who downloaded and tested these builds.  The reports and encouragment have been excellent.

Not a single email asking for Classic support though.  I thought that was interesting (I'm sure they will flood in now).
