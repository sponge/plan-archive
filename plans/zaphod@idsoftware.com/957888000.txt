Just finished a final MacQuake3 fix for Q3F and other mods.  It should be up and
around soon (it needs the latest point release to run).  If any other mods had compile
issues on the Mac, then this patch should fix it as well.

I'm off to E3 tomorrow, and then onto WWDC.  Hopefully I'll see some of you at E3 and
WWDC.

5/8/00

If anyone out there wants to try my new MacQuake3 fix quick for playing Quake 3
Fortress on a Mac, drop me an email (next 30 minutes).

5/8/00

Well, E3 is coming right on up!

John Cash departed from id last Friday to a new position at Blizzard.  I'll let him
fill you in on what he's doing there, but we miss his CTF skills already!  We wish
John all the best, and id looks forward to the forthcoming Diablo II beta copies..

:)

Had to throw that in.

5/5/00

The mission pack CD will actually have builds for Mac, Linux and Win32.  We'll see
if we can stick some OS/X action in there as well..

50 million MOTD messages since the beginning of the year!

Okay, so if I have the math right, that's around 5 game startups per second 24/7!

This is one thing that disturbs me about stats.  Churn through in games like Q3A is
obviously huge, but gameplay time is obviously smaller than other games like Everquest,
so how do we measure?

Merge 93.3 was here the other morning, of course, we destroyed them in deathmatch, but
since then I've listened to them online a bunch (www.merge933.net) and feel the need
to plug.

4/5/99

id has a Q3F server up at 192.246.40.127, id is red, world is blue.

3/21/98

Okay.  X-Files back on track.

I've been thinking a lot about this whole idea of giving out degrees in game
design, and it seems that thereصs a genuine need to be pro active in bringing
new people into the community and teaching them some of our mysterious ways.
What I'd like to look at doing for those people not enrolled in game design
courses at school (who teaches those anyway?) is to start a small skunk works
inside id that has active ongoing support from a few people here, a small
budget, and actively encourages and teaches our trade.

A lot of us (myself included) started out coding in the bedroom and things like
game design documents, schedules, and team coordination were not exactly things
we looked at making or doing because back then no one did.  Nowadays if you want
to make it in the commercial biz of games you've got to be very savvy at
producing a game design that's coherent, conveys the message clearly and
concisely to the team, and has set goals that can scheduled.

Anyway, I'd like to propose that our new skunk works helps out by helping the
game design process, looking at maps, looking at code, and communicating
directly between us, other developers, and the community at large.  It's only in
our best interests to pass on knowledge, get input and give input on what we're
doing, and help make this industry grow.

Thoughts?

X-Files.  I like X-Files.  I didnt like the episode last night -- in fact it 
was awful.

Mr. Gibson, if you want to come down to id and hang out and see how a real
developer makes games you are most welcome.  Heck, you can even help out
on ids next game thereby staying here long enough to get our culture.

2/17/96

The pre-release of the alpha for the forthcoming beta of the pre-build of the
next point release should be out tonight.  Details to follow from Robert Duffy.

2/09/97

Doing a real .plan thing.

I'm looking for a video sequence of high resolution lossless digital images that
we can use in some experiments we've got going here at id.  Up until now we've
been using the in-house rendered stuff, which is great, but I've previously used
some nice standard sources that really test things out like compression and 
color
space conversion issues.  Any pointers would be appreciated.

id vs. the world ctf at 192.246.40.223.  id is red, world is blue.

1/21/97

Just read the PQ article.  Yes, that was an awesome game, I think it was a 
little
closer than the score indicated.  We're itching for a rematch!  I've never had
a game with so many excellents and impressives over my head, and for it to
take a full 50 minutes was something else, it was truly riveting.

BTW, I didn't mean we're not going to play CTF vs. anyone anymore, just that
we're not playing right now.  We have to do some work sometimes!

1/21/98

Okay, we're not playing CTF anymore.

id vs. the world ctf at 192.246.40.223.  id is red, world is blue.

Mr Elusive just put together some bot editing documents, the file is available
on our ftp server:

ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/tools/Q3ABotEdit.zip

We've been following the whole DLL vs. VM debates, and id is firmly on the side
of using VMs for game mods.  We will be addressing the "auto swap" VM
depending on which server you go to quickly (this was a bug) but I think we
will be strict on saying that people should use VMs over DLL files.  The next
executable release will probably have a warning screen come up that you will
need to agree to and click through if the game is about to load a DLL.

1/14/99

Okay.  I see a lot of people with awaiting CD Key authorization questions.

In almost all cases, this is due to the IP address of the authorize server
being wrong because the hosts file on the client has somehow been altered.
You can test to see if this is your problem by going to a DOS prompt and
typing the following:

ping authorize.quake3arena.com

If you get the following, then your system has an invalid entry somewhere
redirecting the authorize requests to the wrong IP address.

If youre running Windows 95/98, then in almost every case editing the file
called hosts which resides in your c:\windows (or wherever youve installed
windows) directory and removing any lines that mention
authorize.quake3arena.com can fix this.

Various cracks and CD key gen utilities (none of which actually work) appear
to be the culprit, adjusting your hosts file without your knowledge or
consent.

While I've been out with the rest of the world trying to get a Barbie Cash
Register for my daughter, I have actually been doing a bit of work!

Activision's release QA process found two bugs in the Mac build that I felt
important enough to fix.  One bug was in the client, and the other in the
installer.

I fixed them both last night and Activision has a new master candidate.

I've heard sporadic reports that the Mac demo has problems, but I've yet
to be able to repeat that issue here.

I'll update my plan file today with the [long] list of things we're addressing
for the point release (yes, we've fixed the scoreboard).

12/16/99

Mac demo will be out tonight.  Mac full version is also complete.

12/14/99

Churn time.  We define Churn as the number of unique people that authorize
in a five-minute period.  At peak now were at around 1700 people in a five-
minute
period, and at off peak were at 500.  Peak is around 5pm-11pm and off-peak is
8am until about noon.  As we get more international I expect this to level out.

Weve been testing Q3A for Y2K compliance.  Heres the results:

1.	Power failed due to Y2K glitch.

Q3A does not run if the power has failed because of a Y2K glitch.  Multiple
attempts to bring the computer on using a series of car batteries and two lines
of tin Q3A boxes did bring the computer up for a second, but the resulting fire
and damage to the building did not allow us to recommend this solution.  We
apologize to Rogue for using their office and cars to test this.

2.	Computer has crashed because of a Y2K glitch.

Q3A does not run if the computer has failed.  Installation of a different OS 
could be
the recommended solution, but the Y2K glitch had caused the computer to 
unrepentantly
jump out the window in a vain attempt to continue crashing.  We apologize to 
Rogue for
using their computers to complete this test.

3.	The worlds nuclear arsenal goes off because of a Y2K glitch.

Q3A does not survive a nuclear war, although the authorize server will continue 
to run.
Actually, we were unable to test this.  Were just guessing.  We really dont 
want to test
this out, so well just it as golden that wed be in big trouble if this 
happened.

4.	The Internet fails because of a Y2K glitch.

Q3A continues to run single player just fine, however, multi-player over the 
Internet could
not startup due to a general TCP/IP error.  With Ebay failing because of this as 
well the
entire US economy would freefall into the cold Atlantic Ocean allowing the alien 
race hiding
on the dark side of the moon to finally begin their insidious campaign of 
marketing 366 days
until 2001 memorabilia.

5.	The coffee machines around the world fail because of a Y2K glitch.

There is no possible worse scenario than this, the lack of Java in the world 
would seriously
undermine the Sun and cause the Earth to plummet into the cold and freeze the 
entire planet.
Starbucks would continue to thrive on selling everything else it produces and 
actually become
more profitable since there would be more throughput at the cash register, but 
since all the
customers would be dead they would relocate to a parallel dimension that voted 
to keep the
date 1999 for just a few more years.

6.	John Carmack fails because of a Y2K glitch.

We have 200 John Carmack clones hidden at secure sites around a small Idaho 
potato
farm (potatoes are considered Y2K compliant by all except the French, who insist 
that potatoes
will spontaneously explode at 4:31am, 1-1-00 ).  Dont worry.  Weve covered 
this base.

12/10/99

Okay.  Im now officially overloaded on email.

Were looking to get the tools out there very soon for creating Q3A 
modifications.
Well probably do a point release on the product before we release anything, and
weve been busy writing (gosh) documentation for the editor, shaders, etc.  Im
really looking forward to seeing what you guys do with Q3A!

Were now cracking down on people using key generators.  We stop accepting input
for a period of time from addresses that spam different keys to the 
authentication
server.  I see a lot of people running key generators right now; Ive yet to see 
a single
one make a correct key.

We will also probably alter the key generation scheme on subsequent runs of the
product so we can verify mistyped keys within the client.  This remains our 
biggest
issue and if we can cure it right at the input step, then well go a long way 
towards
easing this up.

12/08/99

Cracked servers are no longer listed through the master.  We're tracking these 
servers.  We
know your IP address, so if you have one running, I strongly suggest you take it 
down immediately.

12/06/99

Okay.  First off, don't run crack executables on your client!  All it's likely 
to do is grab
your CD key and send it off somewhere.  Authorization is server side, not client 
side.  We will
pursue and close down cracked servers with all available resources.

Secondly, CD keys are "leased", so if you log on through a dialup, play, then 
disconnect your
modem and log right back on, your CD key will have to timeout on your previous 
IP before you
can play again.  This timeout period is currently set at 5 minutes.

12/06/99

Okay.  Hacker attempts with invalid keys are outnumbering real keys by a factor 
of 2:1 or so.

Obviously this is somewhat validating the use of CD keys.

So far I've seen issues with the servers being able to see the auth server and 
clients using
IP forwarding not having the correct setup on the IP forwarding server.  If it's 
a Linux IP
forwarding machine use something like:

modprobe ip_masq_quake ports=26000,27000,27910,27960,27950,27951,27952

Modulating characters within a key sequence will not work.  It appears to work 
because when
you've validated your IP with an authentic CD key you've "leased" that IP 
address for a period
of time.  Even if you enter a junk string, that will work because your IP 
address is still v
