There's a new build of Quake3 for Mac OS X on the id ftp server.  This is for 10.2 or later only.  This version fixes support for certain add in audio sound cards, adds a brand new ppc QVM compiler, and "tada" adds Altivec code to aid MD3 rendering.  Thanks go to Apple and especially Ken Dyke over there for making this happen.
