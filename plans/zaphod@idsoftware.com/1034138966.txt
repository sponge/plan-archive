Mac Point Release 1.32

Just so I'm telling the truth, there is a TEST version of Mac OS X 1.32 up on our ftp (or it will be in a bit, isdn slowness).  If anyone who is willing to test this in the next 24 hours can, and let me know how it goes I'd appreciate it.  Let me know about performance, issues, crashes, etc. asap (while I sleep, been up for 36 hours now) and we'll get this final tomorrow.  If you can, I'd really appreciate it if you can compare performance to previous Q3A installs on your computer.  Add that dual monitor and drag the window between them, use two mice, drink coffee and use the rail gun at the same time.

This is a complete update, all pak files are included, so this drags right over your main Q3A install.  You'll need OS X 10.1 or later to run it.  It addresses keyboard, mouse, OpenGL issues for OS X, and adds support for Gameranger (as well as all the other updates and fixes listed in the readme).

Please email me directly with issues (zaphod@idsoftware.com).

Thank you for your patience.
