Quick update on Mac OS X

If you run with s_chunksize 2048 you get a noticable framerate improvement over the default.  Please note that I forgot to latch s_chunksize, so you need to quit the game and restart after you've changed the value of that cvar.

Mac OS X 10.0.4 seems a lot snappier to me too.
