An OS X (10.1) build of the Wolfenstein MP Test 2 is up and available for download.  I've not gone through and fixed all the niggles I want to get done, but hey it's there.  There's also a separate command line dedicated server since that's been requested quite a few times.

issues:

* You need to nuke the old test before installing and running this one.
* SMP doesn't currently work and is disabled by default.  Don't turn it on.
* This is not a fully optimized build.

Graeme.
