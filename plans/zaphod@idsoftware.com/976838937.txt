Hi there!

We're planning on releasing the final version of the 1.27 point release today.  Barring any last minute
problems it should be out early this evening.  This release is 100% compatible with Team Arena, and addresses
the great feedback we had from the 1.25 beta releases and Team Arena testing.  The physics in the point release
(and Team Arena) are exactly the same as 1.17.  More details will be forthcoming, we just wanted you all to
have a headsup to be prepared!

I released a test version of the Macintosh build of the Team Arena demo to a few volunteer testers last
night, and will continue to work with them on getting both the point release and Team Arena finalized.  I'll
probably seed another test version out there tonight based on the first round of feedback I got today.  The
first respones on this test version have been extremely positive.

Loki has been busy working on the Linux build, and this is also up and running.  We can expect to see binaries
posted from this "shortly".
