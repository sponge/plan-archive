Mac Point Release 1.32


I've put an update executable (the .sit file) up there for testing.

+ added the cvar "in_disableOSMouseScaling", which defaults to 1.  At 1 this does nothing to the OS, when set to 0, the OS is called to and the scaling is reset.  This is to get around the Apple non-reset bug.

+ added function key 13 option to pull down the console for international keyboards.

+ re-fixed the keypad enter key

+ added support for French keypad "," key

+ checked Q3F 2.2 Mod worked (had to bump up hunk memory)

+ use NSEvent timestamp for all mouse/keyboard events

+ fixed GameRanger support issue

Sorry, had DOOM 3 stuff to do mostly today.
