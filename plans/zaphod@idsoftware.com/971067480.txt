I'm putting together the RoQ video encoder and source code for
decoding video files.  This will let you use the RoQ format in
MODs for video and in any other game you want.  The quality
speaks for itself.  Q3A was all 512x256 @ 30hz, while 11th Hour
(the previous use of this codec) was 640x320 @ 15hz.  The RoQ
codec pretty much beats out anything else in terms of quality,
so I'm happy to be finally getting this out there.  I talk a
little about it's development in WIRED magazine (way back when
Newt was on the cover) if you want to go dig..
