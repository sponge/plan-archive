Mac Point Release 1.32

2nd Test is up.  Fixed mods, mouse, keypad, and my timedemo on my machine is up from 102fps to 173fps.  You'll need to nuke your old config file.

The dedicated server requires you to type the full basepath on the command line.  So for me its:

./Q3DedicatedServer +set fs_basepath /Users/zaphod/Quake3
