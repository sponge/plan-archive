One copy of gcc 3.3 later, it's back online.

Update.

Let's try this again with a less buggy compiler...  We've been battling gcc 3.1 to produce code that runs (no problems in 2.95).  It's not weird C code, it doesn't get much cleaner than the Quake3 codebase.  I love technology.

There's a new build of Quake3 for Mac OS X on the id ftp server.  This is for 10.2 or later only.  This version fixes support for certain add in audio sound cards, adds a brand new ppc QVM compiler, and "tada" adds Altivec code to aid MD3 rendering.  Thanks go to Apple and especially Ken Dyke over there for making this happen.
