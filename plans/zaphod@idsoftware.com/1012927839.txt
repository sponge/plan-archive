This is pretty much a message for ex-Trilobyte people.  If you know anyone who used to
work there, please pass this onto them.  Thank you.



Trilobyte's official bat catcher, Scruffy, passed away yesterday.

We found her at the second Trilobyte office, underneath the building.  She was messed up,
scared, and not in the best of shape.  Slowly Dianne and I coaxed that cat out and pretty
soon she ran that office.  When police dogs came to the building one night because the alarm
went off, she chased them right out.

She moved to the third office, and promptly started to catch the bats that would fly out
of the belfry and around the work area.  She got her own web page, email, and confused our
marketing vp by eating the fighting fish she had hung 6' up on the wall.  Scruffy was loved
by everyone at the office, or anyone who visited, a great deal.  She even made a cameo in
one of our games.

Unfortunately she was hit by a car outside that office, and so home she came to the quiet
life.  She moved with me to Texas and has been training our dog every since.

Last weekend she got very very sick, and yesterday she passed away.

Graeme.
