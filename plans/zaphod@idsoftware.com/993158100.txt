A Mac Classic build of 1.29f is in the process of being posted to the id ftp site.

I have not had time to make an installer, or extensively test this build.  SO IT MIGHT NOT WORK.  However, because of user demand I am making it available asap.  If you want to download the .sit file and give it a go, it'll be there shortly.

The filename is quake3-MacClassic-1.29f-BETA.sit
