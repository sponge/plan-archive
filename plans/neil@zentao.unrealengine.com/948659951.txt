I'm new to this plan thing and there's no way I can do fancy updates every day like cyber does. It's nice that we all have them and styff, but my time is not something I want to spend playing with email, ICQ, and plans etc ad infinitum. He wants me to update it so I will, but he can't expect me to be happy about it. I'm not free to talk about the work I'm doing for ZTI, even if I wanted to, so it's a total waste of time. -neil
