Alex doesn't know what the hell he's talking about if you ask me. The Voodoo 5 ownz his ass! He's just annoyed that it doesn't have dualhead or bump mapping support. NEWS FOR YOU ALEX NOT EVERY BOARD HAS TO BE A MATROX TO BE WORTH THE MONEY. I think the V5 is totally amazing, and if I had one to code for, I'd kick Alex in the pants to support t-buffer effects for project X. That's my 2 cents.
