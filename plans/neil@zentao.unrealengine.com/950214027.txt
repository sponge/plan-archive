So epic is porting UT over to PSX2. The man has ideas about EWC
being ported over to consoles.. it sounds like it could be 
interesting to code for the tech.

Speaking of the man, he's been away for a few days on business and
we're all enjoying the peace and quiet. If only he'd take off
more often everything here would be so cool and I could have that
Aura module thing all to myself [evil grin] - neil
