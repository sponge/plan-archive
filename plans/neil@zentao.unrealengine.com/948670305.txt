I'm new to this plan thing and there's no way I can do fancy updates every
day like cyber does. It's nice that we all have them and stuff, but my time
is not something I want to spend playing with email, ICQ, and plans etc ad
infinitum. He wants me to update it so I will, but he can't expect me to be
happy about it. I'm not free to talk about the work I'm doing for ZTI, even
if I wanted to, so it's a total waste of time. -neil

Ok so after 20 minutes of lecturing from the man, I admit it's not a "total"
waste of time to update the silly plan file. -neil
