Hey Mark, was up?  I knew that id was going to use dlls for its rendering engine but I didn't
know that they were going to switch to dlls as a substitute for qc too.  Thanks for the update.

As you know an incredible part of the quake paradigm is based on the qc files.  I don't
think I really understood how much of the paradigm I was going to shatter when I nixed the
qc code.  However the pain is past.

Here is what I like about using the dlls:

1. Speed speed speed.  I can't believe how much faster the c++ code is over the qc code.  
   This is simply due to the fact that qc is interpreted and the dll code is compiled.

2. Modularity.  Daikatana can load as many dlls as you want when the game starts. This means
   that one person can write a reaper bot, another a zeus bot, another person a cool weapon
   and you can run them all at the same time.  Breaking the qc into multiple progs.dat files
   would help this problem but what a mess.

3. Fully supported languages.  Currently we have dlls written in c, c++ and visual basic.
   You can use any language that creates windows dlls.  Also we have a public domain c compiler
   that we are going to distruibute with the game.


Things I don't like about dlls:

1.  Security.  However people download dlls and applications every day and run them.
 
2.  Lockie lockie.  When you have a serious bug in a dll you can lock up your machine
    pretty bad.
