Last .plan update concerning the latest bile duct procedure, I wrote that "I'm going to be very, very ticked off if this didn't fix things once and for all."  Well, I'm very, very ticked off.  The stent hasn't done a damned bit of good, it would seem.  The pain is back, and now it's worse after meals.  I'm back on the pain medicine dosage that I was taking with the stent in place, and that dosage doesn't always work.  Also, the nausea is back worse than before.  In other words, I'm back to where I was before the stent went it, and a little bit worse to boot.

The doctor has added Librax to the current medicinal arsenal (which includes Prevacid, Tigan, and Talwin).  It had been helping some, but didn't do me any good this past Saturday night (a.k.a. Christmas night).  We had ordered barbecue via mail order from The Salt Lick down in Austin (http://www.saltlickbbq.com) for a special non-traditional Christmas dinner with Joe and his wife.  We got the Family Style, which was incredibly good stuff - order some for yourself if you can.  Unfortunately, my system couldn't handle it, even with the help of the medication.  That night and the entire next day were quite horrible, to say the least.

I've got an appointment with the gastroenterologist tomorrow morning, presumably for another liver-prodding session.  I have this horrible feeling that he's going to want to do another ERCP and put in another stent - he did warn me that this would be a possibility.  I'm not going to have that done without a fight, though.  There's <b>got</b> to be something else that he can do that would have a better chance of success.

BTW, the doctor has told me that the "record" for ERCP procedures is nine for any of his patients.  I'm all for breaking records, but I am <b>NOT</b> for breaking that one!!!  If you want the dirty details of the ERCP procedure, go to this link:
