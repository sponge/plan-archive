Last Friday night, July 23rd, was the night of my annual "research trip" to Lake Highlands stadium.  Time for the 23rd Annual Festival of Drums and Bugles - also known as the only place on Earth that Joe Siegler was guaranteed <B>not</B> to be.

Yes, I dig drum corps.  Yes, I enjoy marching bands.  I love the music - I've written for both mediums myself (if you want to play any of it, e-mail me and we'll talk (g)).

Does this make me a total geek?  I could care less.  I get high-powered inspiration from watching/listening to drum corps, and I enjoy the $#@! out of it as well.  That's all I care about.  Hell, how can anyone listen to <A HREF="http://www.regiment.org/media/audio/1995-Paganini.mp3">this</A> or watch <A HREF="http://www.dci.org/videos/santaclara.mov">this</A> and not get fired up?  It's good stuff.

BTW, I'm not even considered a drum corps fanatic by most (Ginger, you may go away now).  I don't quit my job every summer to drive a corps bus, and I was only able to march one season in a drum corps before destroying my left knee.  Again, I don't care - I follow it exactly as I want to follow it, and that's all that matters.

Don't know what the hell I'm talking about?  What's a drum corps?  Well, tune in to your PBS station on August 14th, 1999 and watch the "DCI World Championships Live" broadcast.  Check out http://www.dci.org for more info.  Dallas area fans will have to wait until 11:00am on Sunday the 15th, as KERA refuses to run the thing live.

Now, where did Brenda hide my stadium seat cushions...?
