<B>A Couple of Biscuits to be Floated</B>

An update on a couple of non-work items, for any of you who have been following things from my previous .plan file posts.  It's been a while since I did this, so please pardon the delay as well as the length of this update.


First, a note of interest involving Joe Siegler.  As anyone who has read the Apogee/3D Realms FAQ knows, Joe has always professed a profound dislike of anything related to marching band or drum and bugle corps.  I've poked fun at him for this in the past (seeing as how I'm an alumni of Longhorn Band and the Night Hawks Drum & Bugle Corps), but at the same time I've always offered him a way out of the teasing: come with me to see a show, in person.  I'll pay his way, and if he still hates it afterward, I'll leave him alone.

He has always refused.

Until now, that is.

Brenda, Nathan, and I are going to go see "Blast!" when it comes through Dallas on July 8th.  If you haven't heard of "Blast!," head immediately to <a href="http://www.blasttheshow.com">this site</a> and check it out.  When I found out it was on its way here, I again presented my offer to Joe.  This time he finally took me up on it.

You see, at a Texas Rangers baseball game earlier this year, Joe finally got to hear Longhorn Band play.  That's Longhorn as in the University of Texas at Austin, in case you had any doubts. :-)  Even considering that they didn't bring the full 350-person-plus might of Longhorn Band to the Ballpark (probably a section leader only trip), Joe had never been exposed to a group of this quality before.  It surprised him.  What came as an even bigger surprise was the fact that he enjoyed what he heard.

When I offered the "Blast!" tickets and told him that it would be more exciting than what he'd seen and heard from the small fraction of Longhorn Band, he said he would accept.  So, come July 8th, he and I will round up the collective gang and head out to the evening show.  I do believe he'll have a real blast that night.  (horrible pun intended)

BTW, the original London stage performance of "Blast!" is available on DVD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005A45N/ref=cm_wl_topnav_gateway/ref=cm_wed_ovu-pg.1-pos.16/002-1980275-5919253?coliid=I2YTUM5GH6BR1W">here</a>.  See "Blast!" live if you can:  get this DVD if you can't.

I guarantee that Joe has <b>never</b> seen anything like this.  He may wet himself before it's over. ;-)  I can't wait.


Next up, here's some anime news for you.

I've recently finished watching (via fansubs) a new series, called "Onegai, Teacher!"  It completed its run on Japanese TV earlier this year, and I hear it got very good ratings.  I can see why - it's a very good series.

The series is about an 10th grader named Kei who is actually 18 years old due to a medical condition which caused a 3-year coma of sorts (and which no one in town but his aunt and uncle know about).  The action starts when he witnesses a woman (Mizuho) beaming out of a UFO that landed in the local lake.  She's from the "galactic federation," and her job is to observe and guide human development by becoming a high school teacher.  She winds up teaching Kei's class and living next door to Kei's house.  Kei accidentally learns her secrets and promises not to blow her cover, but through a series of mishaps involving his uncle, aunt, a gym storage room, and the school's principal, things really get out of hand.  In the end, to avoid not only blowing her cover but also to avoid getting himself expelled, Kei tells the principal that Mizuho is his wife.  His aunt and uncle play along and confirm this, and before the principal can run a check, Kei and Mizuho file official marriage papers at city hall.  This solves their immediate problems, but now (by request of the principal) they have to keep their marriage a secret from everyone else in the school.

For some reason, I'm really drawn to these convoluted story lines. ;-)

"Onegai, Teacher!" pulls things off by combining classic farce, "coming of age" story, and secret identity elements with one or two really unique plot points.  It does have some rough spots here and there, but IMHO these are merely due to the fact that they had to fit all of this into just 12 episodes.  Overall, the series hits its mark quite well.  All of these elements have been done before, of course, either on their own or in other combinations, but this series manages to put things together in a way that is quite different and very entertaining.  By the time the series is over, you will really start to care about how things will work out.  This is always a good indication that a series is worth watching.

I don't know if it has been licensed yet, but I can't see how it could possibly be passed up for US distribution.  Fan sites and shrines in English are already popping up on the web, so there's definitely a market over here for the show.  They're even doing a 13th episode in Japan, to be aired later this year.  IMHO, US licensing is more a matter of "when" than of "if."  I strongly recommend it as a title to buy whenever it does come out.  Good stuff.


Finally, a bit of news from the "Well, <i>Now</i> We Understand" department.  Those who have been following the saga of the Amazing Collapsing Bile Duct will be interested in this.

A couple of weeks ago, I had a test and a scan run on me.  In particular, I had a glucose tolerance test and a CT scan of my abdomen.  The doctor ran them because the pain, nausea, and other symptoms of what my previous doctor had been calling post-cholecystectomy syndrome had been getting much worse as of late.  Both the test and the scan produced non-negative results.  The test showed that I have impaired glucose tolerance.  The CT scan showed that I have a liver problem known as Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis.

Impaired glucose tolerance is where one's body doesn't process glucose the way it should.  You still produce insulin, but the body doesn't use it properly.  It isn't diabetes, thankfully, although diabetes can result if it is left unattended.

Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis, or NASH for short, is a condition that resembles a liver disorder (steatohepatitis) found in alcoholic patients.  Since I don't drink, it's called a non-alcoholic variant.  It isn't like the hepatitis of which you hear people passing around by way of viruses - this has nothing to do with a virus at all.  Put extremely simply, this is where your liver stops whatever normal fat processing it does and starts storing it instead.  NASH is a bit more complicated than that, of course:  if you want to see exactly what it is, check out <a href="http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic775.htm">this page</a> (http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic775.htm).

Apparently, NASH can cause all of the symptoms I've had ever since my gallbladder came out back in 1998.  All of the nausea, heartburn, pain, and so on can be traced straight to it, especially since it can cause the liver to become inflamed.  It doesn't explain why I had pigment stones, why my gallbladder almost blew out on me, or why I've also developed impaired glucose tolerance (although impaired glucose tolerance is sometimes seen alongside NASH in a good number of patients).  It <i>does</i> explain why I've been on painkillers for the past three years, though, even though I still have no idea how I came down with it in the first place.

Both impaired glucose tolerance and NASH are rather scary, but NASH is definitely the more frightening of the pair.  NASH can progress into liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, or even liver failure.  The CT scan I had can't show everything: to learn more, a liver biopsy would be required, and I have no intention of letting anyone do <i>that</i> to me anytime soon.  In addition, there's no cure for NASH.  There are three therapies that have been tried, but only one (ursodeoxycholic acid, a.k.a. Actigall) would seem to apply to my variant of NASH, and I've been on Actigall for as long as I've been on everything else with no apparent progress.

For now, the only thing I can do is take care of the impaired glucose tolerance by way of a carbohydrate-restricted diet, and hope that the (with any luck) weight loss that results will help reduce the severity of the symptoms.  I've been referred to someone at Baylor Garland hospital who will be helping me with this.

At least now I finally know the names of the demons I've been dealing with for the past 3 1/2 years.  Only time will tell whether or not I can face them down.
