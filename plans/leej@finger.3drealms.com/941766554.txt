<B>Knife Goes In, Guts Come Out</B>

I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually looking forward to going back into the hospital.  The doctor put a 7 cm long plastic stent in my bile duct back in early September, and I want it taken out.  <B>NOW.</B>

The past seven weeks have been rough, to understate it a bit.  The stent, a narrow plastic tube designed to hold the intestinal end of my bile duct open while it heals, is irritating everything else in the vicinity.  It hurts, and it makes me sick to my stomach at times.  I've been through three different painkillers and two different anti-nausea medicines, and none of them have been very reliable.  The doctor even doubled the dosage of the painkiller, and it still has trouble keeping up with the pain.  It will keep the pain down for a few days, but then it will barely control it at all for a day or two.  Other times, the painkillers will work, but I can't stand up or lie down without feeling like I'm going to hurl.

Needless to say, this does not make it easy for me to write music.  It's hard to concentrate under the influence of a double dose of Talwin.  I'm still making progress, which is rather remarkable when you think about it, but things haven't moved as fast as I'd like.

I'm scheduled to go back into the hospital at noon on this coming Monday, November 8th.  This will be trip number 5 since last December, for those keeping count.  The doctor is going to do the camera-down-the-throat trick again, and this time he'll either remove the stent, or if things haven't healed yet, he'll replace it with a shorter one.  I've made burnt offerings and sacrificed a copy of Shadow Warrior in the hope that he'll choose the removal option.

Wish me luck, folks - I can sure use some nowadays.
