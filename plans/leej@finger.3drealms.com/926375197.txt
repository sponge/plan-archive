<B>Calling Ralph about a Buick</B>

Someone upstairs must have it in for me, based on how things have gone since last November.  Example: last Wednesday (May 5th), I wound up in the hospital again, for the same camera-down-the-stomach open-up-the-bile-duct procedure that I had after they yanked the gallbladder.  The very next day, I had to make a trip to the HMO's "urgent care" clinic because of pain and spasms in the area they worked on the previous day.

It just never seems to stop.  My wife says my body is self-destructing.  I'd love to argue the point with her, but how do I defend?

Anyway, today is Monday, May 10th, 1999.  I'm hoping I can start a completely new year from today, without the problems that have followed me so far.  I'm getting extremely smegging tired of "recuperating."
