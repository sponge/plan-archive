I just read a story on about Chinese hackers/crackers/whatever finally getting around to hitting U.S. Government sites in some sort of twisted retaliation for their jet sideswiping our airplane.  Some of the defacements they left look like they could have come straight out of Zero Wing:

"The Great Chinese Nation Hooray!!!!"
"USA Will Be With Responsibility for the Accident Total!!!"
"Protest USA sell Weapon to Taiwan Break World Peace!!!"

You know what I'd like to see?  I'd like to see someone get on to one of their websites and leave for them a simple, one-line note:


"All Your Base Are Belong To Us!"


The look of confusion on their faces would make a priceless Kodak moment.  I wonder if they'd get the joke.
