<B>Most Gratuitous Use of the Word "Belgium" in a Serious Screenplay</B>

I've received an e-mail directed at the members of the Video Game Musicians' mailing list that had some rather good news.  NARAS, the Grammy organization, has apparently agreed to expand the television and motion picture group of categories to include game music.  Sierra's Chance Thomas, who spearheaded the group that met with NARAS, forwarded this excerpt from a press release:

"The Best Soundtrack Album category will be part of a new Field, Music for Film, television and Other Visual Media, which will also house the Best Song for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media and Best Instrumental Composition for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media."

In other words, it looks like game music will now compete directly with TV and movie soundtracks for Grammys.  This is a huge step - at last, game music has been acknowledged as a legitimate art form.

Game music did not get its own category, but I don't see this as a negative.  I see it as a tremendous challenge.  In a way, NARAS has set the standard by saying that game music is in the same league as TV and film music, and it is now up to game musicians to meet this standard.  Other genres have had to share a category before (dance and rap come to mind), but once the fields showed their worth, they were given their own category.  I believe that will eventually happen with game music as well.

All in all, it's been a good day for the game music scene.  Except for my server crashing at home, I'd say it's been a pretty enjoyable one for myself as well. ;-)
