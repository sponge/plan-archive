<B>"My Shoes are Melting!" - me, Austin, TX, 1981</B>

I am really wishing I were someplace else right now.  Specifically, in Madison, Wisconsin, for the Drum Corps International World Championships.  This is turning out to be a really exciting season, and I'd love to be able to see it finish out in person.  Listening to MP3 snippets in the studio just doesn't cut it.

My last .plan update didn't make it out to many of the sites, so let me repeat - if you want to know what I'm talking about, head on over to <A HREF="http://www.dci.org">http://www.dci.org</a> and look for the "live broadcast" details.  Some PBS stations are carrying the final competition live this coming Saturday (August 14th), while others, including the local Dallas PBS station, are showing it tape-delayed the next morning.  I will definitely be planted in front of the tube for this one.

BTW, anyone know a band or drum corps that wants a field arrangement of Grabbag?  Get them to e-mail me, and I might just be willing to talk.  You never know. ;-)
