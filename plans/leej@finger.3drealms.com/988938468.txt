I'm trying to find a certain page out on the web that seems to have slipped into my bit bucket.  The page had a list of sorts, talking about what the author had learned from different anime series.  Scattered through the list were three entries, not immediately one after another, that went something like this:

What I learned from Gundam:
  "I have GOT to get me a giant robot!"

What I learned from (some other series - Macross? Votoms?):
  "Man, I have REALLY got to get me a giant robot!"

What I learned from Neon Genesis Evangelion:
  "I really DO NOT need a giat robot!!!"


The first person to send me the correct link to the correct page will win their choice of a fully motorized pig, a dryer fabric softener sheet (slightly used), or a week for two with the Mayor of Gun Barrel City, Texas in the lawsuit of your choice (return fare not included).

(Offer void in Texas or any other location on Earth.  Offer expired five weeks ago, and he's really starting to smell up the place a bit.)
