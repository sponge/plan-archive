After 19 years, we can finally light this candle...

University of Texas Baseball is back on top where it belongs.  Champions of the College World Series.  Oh, man, that was a good game this past Saturday.  I remember the last two times they won (1975 and 1983).  This time is just as sweet, if not sweeter.

In other news, I finally managed to lay my hands on a copy of Don Sebesky's "Giant Box" album.  This 1973 release would be familiar to anyone who has studied Sebesky's "The Contemporary Arranger/Composer" book.  I've been looking for this thing since I was in high school, and I finally found it by way of a Japanese 24-bit CD remaster.  The disc arrived from Japan today.  Very interesting listening material indeed - now, all I need to do is get the book out again and revisit the examples he drew from this album.
