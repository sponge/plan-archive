<B>Quiet, Please, I Can't Hear My Nails Growing</B>

There's an interesting article over at AMDMB.com, called <a href="http://www.amdmb.com/article-display.php?ArticleID=122">"Of Things Quiet."</a>  It's a rundown of several rather snazzy devices that are designed to reduce the amount of noise coming out of your computer.  It's a very interesting read.  Quite educational, especially to someone like me who works with sound all day long.

I wrote to the author of the article (Bob Dyl) and asked him about a particular brand of fan that was recommended to me a while back.  The person who recommended the brand was Russ Berger, head of the <a href="http://www.rbdg.com">Russ Berger Design Group</a>.  His Dallas-based company designs recording environments for studios all around the world, for which he has won the prestigious <a href="http://www.tecawards.org">TEC</a> award several years in a row.

The brand of fan in question is made by <a href="http://www.comairrotron.com">Comair Rotron</a>.  Russ Berger recommended these fans as replacements for system fans, saying that they were the quietest he knew of that would provide adequate cooling.  I figure that he knows what he's talking about (he should, based on his reputation), so it's been a bit of a puzzlement to me as to why I've never seen any of the PC overclocking or gear enthusiast websites mention them or include them in their roundups.

If you look at the documents on their website, it would appear that they have done a good deal of research into acoustics, airflow, and fan noise.  They have a ton of charts and graphs detailing RPM, power, decibels, and so on.  I'm not sure that their fans would be suited for heavy duty overclocking, which might be why they don't get any press.  Still, I'd be very interested to see how they'd fare in a noise level test.

I haven't been able to try them in the studio, for multiple reasons.  I tend to either fry circuitry, burn/shock myself, or both when I do anything that involves soldering or cable construction.  (Give me a case and a box of PC components, though, and I'll build you a system from scratch and have it running in no time.)  I'm hoping that Mr. Dyl will be able to do a bit of testing on them sometime soon.

If you or someone you know are familiar with Comair Rotron fans, please drop me a note.  I'd be interested to read about your experiences with them.  Thanks!
