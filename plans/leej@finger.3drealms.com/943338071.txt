<B>Michelin Tires, Rubber, and...Surgical Implants?</B>

My Daruma doll now has both its eyes painted in.  The second attempt at removing the stent was successful.  The doctor gave it to me, sealed in a pair of little biohazard bags.  He apparently has a different definition of "thin" than most people do.  What I was lead to believe was a thin implant turns out to look more like a shred of tire tread that you'd find coming off the track at Indy or Daytona.  It's about 6-7 cm long, with a pair of hook-like protruberances on each end (to keep it from slipping, I guess).  It's also several mm wide, square, and made of some sort of rather nasty looking black rubber or plastic.

No wonder I've had to take pain killers since September.  Good lord, I had a chunk of B.F. Goodrich inside me.

So, now I begin the wait to see if it did any good.  I spent my birthday and most of the weekend dealing with medicine residue and occasional soreness (I'm not completely off the pain meds yet), so I'm still a bit shaky and unable to really tell if I've improved much.  I have an appointment next week to have follow up liver function tests, etc. to check everything out.  I'm going to be very, very ticked off if this didn't fix things once and for all.
