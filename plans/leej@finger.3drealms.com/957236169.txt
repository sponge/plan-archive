<B>They Call Me Mister Chairman</B>

Well, I went ahead and did it.  Just a little while ago, I was sworn in as the Democratic Precinct Chair for Dallas County Precinct 2142.  The way I see it, no one was in the position in the first place, so if I wind up not being able to do too much, it won't be too much different from how things have already been. ;-)  Never mind that I have no clue as to what I'll have to do.  The county HQ is going to schedule training workshops.  The only thing that I know that I'm supposed to do is ask people in my precinct these questions:

<OL>
<LI>Are you a Democrat?</LI>
<LI>Are you registered to vote?</LI>
</OL>

If the answer to question number 1 is no, then I'm not supposed to ask them question number 2. <evil grin>


Medical update time.  As I said last time, my last liver function test showed an elevated SGPT (a.k.a. ALT) level.  This is an indication that an enzyme known as SGPT/ALT is getting out of the liver and entering the bloodstream.  This level was in the mid 90s, when it should be somewhere between 7 and 50 or so.  (Again, for information, check out http://my.webmd.com/content/asset/adam_test_sgpt .)  While this is still a high level, I've learned from the nurse that my doctor says that it is normal <b>for me</b>.  I assume this means that the level isn't spiking up on me, which is good.  It does not explain the continued pain, though.

Who knows - maybe it's scar tissue, maybe it's something they haven't tested me for yet, or maybe I really have sprung a mental gear and it's all in my head.  Considering how bad it hurts at times, I kind of doubt that last option.  I may be crazy, but I'm not psychosomatic. :-)  Anyway, I've got an appointment again after E3.  We'll see what happens then.
