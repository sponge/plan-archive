Got a couple of these sitting on top of the audio monitors in my studio now:

Nice.

On an anime-related topic:  I finally received the last DVD in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-/EPEXBOJZO7QJ/107-9200949-6173335">Blue Seed</a> series.  I'd seen the series on the Encore Action Channel before, but only in dub form.  As usual, the original Japanese version is exponentially better.  If you're not familiar with the series, check out the link.  This has got to be one of the most underrated anime series ever produced, right up there with Tenshi ni Narumon!.  Highly recommended.
