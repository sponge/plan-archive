Newbie with a .plan file here.  Go ahead, be disgusted Pythbert.

Who am I and why should you care?  You prolly shouldn't, so no worries.  I'm a designer for Myth 3 and a game industry newbie.  I was hired on after making various myth community mappage such as <a href='www.vistacartel.com/jinn'>THIS</a> one right <a href='www.vistacartel.com/jinn'>HERE</a>.

Without running around the pool too much my first time out, I'd like to comment on this whole Anachronox business.  I like this game, despite it's faults, at 20 hours into it I'm liking the storyline alot.  I don't wanna give anything away, but when the game gets going it becomes inspired fun.  Wish I had more time to play it (I somehow manage to slip in maybe 3-4 hours a week on it) but yaknow, duty calls  =D

Scott Campbell and Pat Hook are very nice and sweet gentlemen.  Don't hit me anymore plz!  I promise I will work harder and not embarrass the company anymore really  *cries*
