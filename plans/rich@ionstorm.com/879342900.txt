Looking for a spare Roland RAP-10 soundcard. Anyone out
there got one they want to get rid of? If so, email me
at rich@ionstorm.com. I'll pay up to $50 for one if you
want to sell... (Perfect condition ONLY, please - 
ie: still in shrink wrapped box.)

Romero keeps recommending the new Roland card(s)... But 
I'm not convinced... More sounds, yeah, but not necessarily
BETTER sounds... This is pretty subjective, I realize, and 
depends on what one likes, personally.

Kind of like with synth keyboards. One person digs Korg.
Another, Kurzweil... Someone else will SWEAR by Roland.
And then a nifty, new Proteus module comes out, and
everyone wants that...

I'd been composing with the RAP-10 for about two years.
The stuff I'd done back then just doesn't fly on the
new Roland cards... I do already have one at home, but
I need one for at work...

Deanna (artist) and I are beginning a whole new area for
ANACHRONOX. Can't say much about it, except that there
are like 25 levels/locations and it's a very mystical,
haunting and beauitiful place. (Kind of scary, too.)

Again, we're not thinking QUAKE, but inventing a whole
new look specifically for this "dimension".

Deanna, who was just doing textures, is also helping
with the level design now, as well. We are collaborating 
in a wholly unique and different way, and it's pretty 
exciting.

Deanna ROCKS.

Saw BEAN last night.

Stupidest, silliest, low budget piece of crap I've seen
since DUMB AND DUMBER.

I just loved it. (Still giggling.)

ANACHRONOX be lookin' damn good!

Here's why:

Brian, Jay, Lee, Ben, Chris, Seneca, Niqui,
Deanna, Doug, Jerry, Rocketman, Cleaner, 
Jake, Will, Joey and Squirrel.

(Also many thanks to Nelno, Dabug, Kee,
Shawn, Sverre and John R., from Daikatana,
for their invaluable "indirect" help!)

It's a blast working with you all on this
awesome WHOPPER GAME!

Still a long way to go, but with this team,
I know that ANACHRONOX will blow everything
else to SMITHEREENS when it hits, sometime
in late '98. (No contest there!)

God, I can't wait to play it. I can't wait
for everyone to see it! Hang on to your
Potato, Tom. THIS IS THE BIG ONE!

 * * * * *

Saw STARSHIP TROOPERS. Liked it a lot! Bad
acting. Threadbare version of Heinlein's
not-quite-classic story. But the special FX...
WOW! We are talking Academy Award here.

I remember how I felt after seeing ALIENS.
I thought it was going to be similar to
Heinlein's Starship Troopers novel. (The
BIG Bug Hunt.) It wasn't. So-so story and
so-so special fx (even for its day). The
bug hunt was overshadowed by the BIG QUEEN
finish, which I still think is cheesy. 
Also, the "macho bitch" stereotype was, to 
me, a big turn-off. (Ripley v2.0 and 
Vasquez.) Other than the dialogue, which I 
thought was fairly good, and even funny 
(Hicks), I was pretty disappointed.

Well, finally, the big bug hunt has come
to the big screen, and it was worth the
wait. The computer generated alien bugs 
are SEEMLESSLY integrated into battle 
scenes of astounding complexity. If you 
liked the flock of bounding "ostrich" 
dinosaurs in JURASSIC PARK, you'll be 
blown away at the amazing stuff in this 
imperfect, but mindbogglingly convincing 
film.

Starship Troopers IS gory. Preteens or
those with an insect phobia should stay
away. But it is also spectacular...
Sublime in its display of something
way beyond the normal scope of most
human experience.

Go see it!

Had an aniversary, of sorts, this
month. Since I started designing levels
just over a year ago, I've created 36 
maps (actually 37, but see below) for
various ID and RAVEN games, as well as 
half dozen or so for ION STORM. It was
in Nov. of last year when my first
few maps began to appear on bbs's and
on the WWW.

Not trying to toot my own horn too
loudly. It's just that I'm amazed and
proud that it all led to where I am
today.

Here's the "compleat" list. Most of
these maps are available at CDROM.COM,
btw. 

(The level title, followed by the 
map/filename. An asterisk * means that 
it's a personal favorite of mine.)

DOOM     *DEMON PITS OF DOOM
           (demon13/demonse)
          FIENDISH DM (fiendish)
         *LAST HOPE OF THE UAC
           - 8 level episode -
           (lasthope/lhsplit/zdimhope)

HERETIC  *GRENDEL (gren10)
         *THE CHAOSIAN 
          (chaosian/mandor11) 
          BIG RED (bigred12)
          WIZARD WARS (wizwars)
         *ORBQUEST (orbqv12) 
          WIZARD'S REVENGE (wrevenge)
          RETURN TO WHITE PLUME 
           (hwhite2)
          CREATURES OF LIGHT AND 
           DARKNESS
           (cold10/cold20/cold40)

           (cit10)

HEXEN    *ARCHMAGE (arch10)

QUAKE    *THE BLACK CRYPT (crypt)
          DEMON HUNTER (hunter)
          THE RAT HOLE (rathole2)
         *FANE OF THE DIABOLIST* (fane11) 
         *PANDEMONIUM (pand01a)
          THE CAVES OF CARNAGE (carnage)

   + 7 levels (so far) for ANACHRONOX
   + 1 level for DAIKATANA (abandoned)

Okay, we all finally checked out Iikka Keranen's
AIRQUAKE.

Wow! Jets, tanks, aircraft carriers... Air,
land and sea battles... It's a realtime war
simulation, made with the QUAKE engine. Iikka did
the models, skins, maps, textures, QUAKE C...
And it totally ROCKS!

Go here (Iikka's AIRQUAKE page) to download the
latest version:

AIRQUAKE
http://www.planetquake.com/ikq/airquake.htm

(While you're there, be sure to backtrack to his
levels page, and get Iikka's "blue levels" too.
Cool stuff, indeed.)

Cleaner (Dave Namaksy, Lead Level Designer for
ANACHRONOX) turned me on to a real cool QUAKE
"prefabs page":

The QUAKE Prefab Park
http://www.planetquake.com/qpp/

Cool pre-made arches, tunnels, lights, bridges,
pentagrams, pillars, t-ports, etc., all in .map
file format. Go check it out!

Anyway, gotta get back to work. ANACHRONOX
milestone on the 31st!

Eagerly awaiting the full release of Jedi Knight.
(Tomorrow, hoo boy!) What I've seen so far just
makes me drool with anticipation. LucasArts rules,
as usual.

Still playing FF VII. Made it to disc 2, and it just
keeps getting better and better. I have just
updated this classic game to "My favorite game
of all time", beating out Wing Commander III & IV,
Ultima: Underworld, and yes, even Chrono Trigger!

Another game I'm spending a fair share of my
weekend time with is MicroProse's Master of Orion
II. Very addictive. It's got most of the features
you'd want in this type of "Stellar Conquest"
game. If you liked games like "Imperium
Galactum", "Reach for the Stars" or even
"Civilization", you'll dig this one. It's only
about $30 right now in stores, so watcha waitin'
fer?

Wish I could talk more about ANACHRONOX, but the
lid is still on tight, at least until December or
so... Screenshots should be happening by then, if
not sooner, btw. Stay tuned to www.ionstorm.com for
the latest details.

Also, here's the URL to my humble homepage, 
Zdim's Weapon Rack:

All kinds of new links and stuff this month, so go
check it out!

Playing FINAL FANTASY VII. (Who isn't?!!) Cheesy
translated dialogue and racial stereotypes aside,
this is a classic game. If you're interested in
what Tom Hall's ANACHRONOX is styled after,
then check out this SquareSoft whopper (and it's 
predecessors, like Chrono Trigger).

Also HIGHLY recommended: Raven's HEXEN 2. They've
done it again, folks.

The new ANACHRONOX models by Lee Perry and his crew
(dozens of 'em, by now) are awesome. Even the 
Daikatana guys are jealous. Way to go Lee!

I've done six levels (plus a "secret level") so far
for ANACHRONOX and things are looking pretty cool.
(Geez, only about 150 more levels to go!) Should
explain here that an ANACHRONOX map can be
anything from a single room/location, to a full
"QUAKE-sized" level...

Heard that Iikka's been getting a lot of attention
on Usenet lately (re: his DOOM2 maps, as well as his
QUAKE levels). Go here if you want to download
Adelusion's GOTHIC DEATHMATCH set (DOOM2) featuring
lots of Iikka's fine work:

http://members.aol.com/adelusion/adel.html

I found the best deathmatch author on the web. A guy
from Italy (Adriano Lorenzini) who makes the fastest
and prettiest QUAKE dm maps I've seen so far. Here
are the CDROM.COM addresses for four of his maps
so you can go get 'em and drool. Be sure to check
out DE BELLO, but they all ROCK!

It's official! Hailing all the way from Finland, Iikka
"Fingers" Keranen (Eeka) will be joining Team
ANACHRONOX, filling our last map designer position. If you
collect user QUAKE levels, you are probably already very 
familiar with Iikka's fine work. His infamous (and gorgeous) 
"blue levels" (IKSPQ2, IKSPQ3 & IKSPQ4) have been among the 
best maps seen on the WWW in the last four or five months.

Welcome Iikka!

If you haven't seen his levels, go to his home page
(or CDROM.COM) and check them out!

First, I'd like to get some "thank you's" in:

 To Ken Alverson - Your WBSP is great. And thanks, too, for
  your prompt, knowledgeable and easy-going responses to my
  questions and gripes. You "da man"!

 To Team ANACHRONOX - Tom, Jake, Cleaner, Squirrel, Rocketman
  and Joey: I have difficulty expressing just how much I
  admire all of you, and what a blast is to work with you all.
  This is a "Dream Team" in the truest sense of the word.

 To Ben Herrera, Deanna Molinero and Seneca Menard -
  What can I say? Your work, creatively supervised by our
  own Master of Illuminations, Jerry O'Flaherty, is the
  best in the business. Period. ANACHRONOX lives and
  breathes because of your inspired, fantastic artwork.

 To David McCandless (PC Zone) and Nash Werner (PC Games):
  Two of the nicest guys in the "mag biz" that I've ever
  met. Rock on, dudes!

 To Autolycus (at The Forge) - It's too bad you have to
  hold your finger in the dyke right now with WC... But
  thanks for doing it and your thoughtful updates from
  time to time. Ben owes you one, I think...

 To Coca Cola - Thanks for still making TAB. Without it,
  I'd be 50 lbs. overweight by now, instead of just 20.
  Been with you since circa 1967 or so, and still drinking.
  I figure I'm pre-embalmed with TAB, so when I croak, it
  should save a few bucks on funeral expenses. Anyway, 
  Nutrasweet sux, and everybody knows it.

Okay, that's out of the way. Gotta get this in before I go:

ADELUSION (http://members.aol.com/adelusion/adel.html) has
to be one of the hardest working non-pro map makers around.
DYSTOPIA III, which he made for DOOM2 years ago, is legendary, 
and still, this guy just keeps cranking the classics out. 
His latest, the GOTHIC DEATHMATCH series, is really fun and
QUITE an eyeful. Go to his page and get this. It's well
worth the download time. (Fer Chrissake, why doesn't
somebody hire this guy?)

See ya next time...

July 19, 1997

Spent a little time at QuakeCon...

Saw HEXEN2, which got me all misty-eyed and nostalgic for the
good old days when HERETIC and DOOM ruled the roost... The
guys at RAVEN are cooking up a really cool update. (What I saw
was VERY unfinished, but potentially a classic in the works, IMO.)
Still wondering how they'll top the Morph Ovum (or Porkelator)
this time!

Got to watch THRESH take on ROMERO, PARADOX, VOIN and KILLCREEK.
Dennis whomped them all, one by one. The scores are so embarassing,
I dare not quote them here... Ten dollar bets were happening as to
whether anyone would even get ONE FRAG on the guy... Unfortunately,
I missed the game between Dennis and Noel (SHADOW), but the results
were the same...

THRESH did mention that he has a web site devoted to hardcore
deathmatch strategy. It's called GX: GAMERS EXTREME.
