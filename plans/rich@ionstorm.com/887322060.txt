February 12, 1998

Today, gentle readers, I'm going to talk about NetHack,
a "roguelike", D&D style RPG, available as freeware for
most platforms.

I know this game has been around a _long_ time, but I've
only recently encountered it myself (via Iikka Keranen).

When I first executed it, I thought: "Urgh! It's ugly!
Wazzis, another crappy dungeon hack game?"

Well, it IS odd looking at the outset. (Text graphics
only...) But once you play a few games, you begin to
realize that there is far more going on then is
initially apparent. In fact, the game is HUGE!

NetHack has been in developement for 11 years on the net,
and it shows. I don't know how many $50, svga, full sound
and speech, RPG (so called) blockbusters I've (literally)
chucked into the wastebasket after a few hours, saying
things like: "Piece of shit!" or "Why can't they get it
right? Argh!!!" Then NetHack comes along and simply blows
the competition away with it's richness, subtlety,
variety and humor. Wow! (And the executable is barely
over 1 meg.)

So do yourself a favor. Grab a copy of it and jump in.
I think, if you like D&D, you'll prolly flip as much as
I have.

Go to

Zdim's Classic Adventure Games & Links site
http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Alley/6181/adventur.html

and look for the NetHack section. You can download the
latest version as well as SLASH, the latest variant of
NetHack.

Here's a direct link to NetHack, in case you don't want
to browse:

NetHack v3.2.2
http://pinky.wtower.com/nethack/binaries/msdos/nh322pm.zip

It's somehow very cool to know that a COMPLETE rpg
adventure game is just a mouseclick away! Drop a shortcut
to it on your desktop and you'll never play MS Solitaire
or Tetris again! (OK, I don't play those either, but you
know what I mean...)

 = )

Happy adventuring!

Zdim's Weapon Rack is not dead!
http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Alley/6181/index.html

Sorry if you've tried to get to Zdim's Weapon Rack lately.
Bizarre and unpredictable problems with the servers at
Geocities means intermittent "down" periods. I have no
control over this. (Plus, Geocities just can't seem to answer
any of my email inquiries, whether I'm nice or flamey...) I
guess I'll be moving from there soon, even though I feel a
debt of gratitude to them for hosting my first web home...
I'll hang tight for a month or so until ION gets us set up
with a server for employee websites. (After the BIG move
upstairs to 54.)

 * * * * *

Cleaner's purple hair IS fading... But I hear he's trying to
track down "Crazy Monty", his hairdresser, who was last seen
on a street corner in Deep Ellum selling pornographic bibles,
so things should be set to rights soon. (I think I'm going to
get a mohawk, btw. Hi-yooooo!)

 * * * * *

*XYZZY!*

------------------------------------------------------------

January 12, 1998

Moving upstairs (to the 54th floor) soon. Can't wait.
I thought Paisley Park was cool but ION's new offices
are actually cooler. No pesky musicians around either!
(Sorry Will. Okay, just one, but he's not "pesky"...)

 * * * * *

Still working on that huge set of "scary levels" for
Anachronox. Textures are coming along, yet will change
once the game gets moved over completely to Q2. Deanna
and Jay are really doing a nice job with this rather
challenging set of maps. We'll be here for a while...
(There are, what?, like 25 plus levels for this spooky,
ghostly island? Wow, Tom, next time make a little game
like Quake 2 wouldja? Kidding of course.)

Oh, Lee Perry also made an extemely convincing "pirate
ship" for one of the seaport harbors. A complete ship.
Captain's quarters... Cabins and hold below deck... All
of the trimmings... Awesome job, Lee!

Listening to good ol' Switched On Bach (Walter Carlos)

January 8, 1998

Well, it was a year ago since I made my first QUAKE
level. A scary little map, called The Black Crypt.
(Played it again recently. Still a pretty darn fun
level!) Reflecting, it all makes sense to me now,
but at the time, I wasn't even aware of the BOOM in
game/level design that was about to happen. I certainly
had no inkling as to my future in gaming back then...
I'd spend the days between gigs (I was in a funky blues
band at the time.) tweaking my HERETIC, DOOM and QUAKE
levels. Late at night, after a gig, I'd prowl the
internet and catch up on my emails.

It was also a very hard time for me, personally. My
uncle Don passed away. My favorite cat (the seemingly
immortal Wilbur) died while I treated him for
diabetes. (Aw... Poor kitty.) I'd had a massive hard
drive crash a few months before, where I lost like
four years of midi music, and was trying to revive my
backlist of jingles and industrial music. Also, a
company that I was writing music for folded... Gawd,
one Hell of a bad winter, I guess...

More and more, I became involved with level editing,
so that by January of 1997 it was pretty much a full
time fascination for me. I'd work enough gigs and
give enough lessons to pay the rent and buy food and
ciggies, but ALL of my real time went into maps.

Then this amazing email from Dr. Sleep. And another
from John Romero... My whole life changed within the
span of two weeks... And I dare say that I'm still
recovering from the shock!

So, I owe a debt of gratitude to a few people. And
I'd like to thank them for rescuing me from all of
that and helping me get on this "new" track. I haven't
had this much fun in a job since my "early days" in
show/variety bands (being on the road and travelling
all over the midwest). 

To Dr. Sleep, Steve Rescoe, Matt Sefton, Crash,
Rick Troppman, Paul Taylor, John Bye, Myscha,
Brian Uhrig, Steph & Karen Jerde, John Williston,
Joost Schuur, Mark Murray, Adelusion --- To all of
you: Thanks so much for all of your help and 
encouragement.

To John Romero and Tom Hall --- You guys picked the
finest crew of level designers that I've ever heard
of, for ION's first two 3D games. To be a part of that
line up is a daily thrill, a complete challenge and
one of the most excruciatingly fun experiences of my
life.

Also, a special thank you to Pam Wolford and Mindy
Eickhoff at ION for really helping to make the 
transition from Minnesota to Texas pretty darn 
painless! *hugs*

Rock on in 1998!

Zdim's TOP 5 VIDEO/COMPUTER GAMES of 1997

#5  The Neverhood - PC
#4  Dungeon Keeper - PC
#3  Myth - PC
#2  Jedi Knight - PC
#1  Final Fantasy VII - Playstation

Of all of this year's releases, the above five games
represent, to me, the best of the best.

Whether a game is "hip" or "cool" really isn't the
issue for me. (I still play classics like "MULE" and
"ZORK II" beacause they're excellent and timeless.)
To get on my list, a game has to transcend the trends,
be unique is some way, and above all, be absolutely a
gas to play.

FF VII gets on the list because it simply is the best
"computer rpg" yet. It is stunning in scope, story,
graphic pizzazz, playability and overall production.
Everyone who has a Playstation should get this. Period.

(QUAKE 2 got bounced down a notch or two primarily
by JEDI KNIGHT, which is an even better single player
game, imho, and the recently released MYTH, which
seems to have surprised everyone.)

 * * * * *

MYTH by Bungie Software

Get it. Play it. Be happy.

 * * * * *

If you haven't heard by now, a bunch of us at ION

Had an AWESOME level designer meeting today. Cleaner and
Rocketman are very fine fellows, indeed.

 * * * * *

Still digging the Q2 stuff and Quake Ed 4. Rocketman and
I are moving to QE4 full time now. (Er... Well... I still
will be using Worldcraft to build some of the really weird
stuff... hahaha...)

Thanks to ALL at ID for a great new game and some
FANTASTIC tools to work with! *smooch*

 * * * * *

Heading back up to Minnesota tomorrow for a few days.
My sister, Shari, is graduating, with honors, from
St. Catherine's... She's finally going to do the work
she was always cut out for: elementary education. Some
very lucky kids are going to get one Hell of a teacher
next year!

CTHUGHA is alive and well and living on the WWW!

(CTHUGHA, an amorphous, fiery being from the stories of
H. P. Lovecraft.)

Actually, what I'm refering to is a nifty program which
generates amazing images on your computer when coaxed by
your favorite CD.

The DOS version is still around, but the newer win95 and
GL versions absolutely ROCK. Get this. (It's freeware too!)
It will knock your socks off.

Just a reminder:

Be sure to stop in at the "Official ANACHRONOX Chat",
4-5pm, Fridays, at questgate.gameslink.net in #questgate.
(IRC)

Everyone had fun last time, so come on by and "rap" with
Tom Hall, Rocketman, myself, and others from Team
ANACHRONOX.

Topics? Besides info about the game, we plan to explore:

 1. The phenomenon of time reversed light.
 2. The Cheese Factor: Do our favorite cheeses really
     belong in an RPG?
 3. The psychological impact and ramifications of violent,
     3D shooter games on America's morally desensitized
     youth.
 4. Team member shoe sizes.
 5. None of the above.

We may just skip to #5, so show up with some cool
questions yourselves, okay?

 * * * * *

Listening to 70's music from Rocketman's cubicle.

Got my "official, mail-ordered" STARSHIP TROOPERS t-shirt
today. (Army green with lots of logos and stuff all over
it!) w00p! Thanks, Jake!

Now I can put off doing laundry for one more day...

ALIEN RESURRECTION just got knocked out of the #1 box
office slot by FLUBBER after, like, two weeks.

I rest my case.

 * * * * *

Building more rocks, boulders and debris, for two fairly
simple ANACHRONOX maps. (Is there such thing as a simple
ANACHRONOX map? Well, a few of them are just single
rooms or locations, crammed with detail, but not overly
large at all... Yet, even some of the simplest areas have
very long full vis times due to the detail we put into
them... Oh, how I miss the DOOM2 three or four minute bsp
build!)

 * * * * *

Hey, Iikka Keranen finally got his VISA! That means he'll
be stateside in a matter of days/weeks. w00p! Congrats,
Iikka! Looking forward to working (goofing off) with you,
very soon...

 * * * * *

Well, this is the Week of QUAKE 2. Everyone will be
buying it/playing it, including yours truly. Hats off to
ID SOFTWARE for creating what looks to be another solid
classic computer game.

 * * * * *

2PRONG stopped by early and we had a little chat about
"things that make you happy on a Monday morning", like
going outside to have a smoke, silly emails, etc. Gosh
the people that work here are (for the most part)
mellow and groovy!  :- )

 * * * * *

Listening to Joe's Garage (Frank Zappa), Live At The
Roxy (Frank Zappa), and Man From Utopia (Frank Zappa).
It's Frank Zappa Day for Team ANACHRONOX!

Updated HOPPING MAD last night. Rocketman had some
excellent suggestions for making this dm level slipperier
than ever, so I just had to implement the changes. Go to

Meeting day today.
Level designer meeting and a talk with Squirrel about
All Things Func. Should be pretty fun!

 * * * * *

Today at 4pm, CST, Tom Hall, Rocketman and myself (and
maybe a few others on the team) will begin a weekly, hour
long chat about ANACHRONOX. (And anything else we feel
like talking about!) This will be an ongoing thing. It's
being hosted by QuestGate, Anachronews, 3D Alpha, and
ION Storm (It'll be on GamesLink IRC in #questgate. If 
you do not know a GamesLink server, you can use
gameslink.questgate.net, btw.) Hope to see you all there!

Nothing much to say today.
Just listening to music, doing a meeting and building
a HUGE Grand Canyon-like chasm for ANACHRONOX.
Not a bad job at all!

I just heard that there is something called QUAKE 2
coming out real soon... (Hmmm... how did I miss this?)
Don't know much about it, but it's supposedly a sequel
to some other game called, not surprisingly, QUAKE.
Anyone with any additional info, please keep it to
yourself, because there are so many games coming out
this year and next, I don't have time to check out
every last release...

The game I'm really waiting for is DAIKATANA!

 * * * * *

Listening to Mr. Mature (Willie Murphy), the Psycho
Soundtrack (Bernard Herrmann), and Switched On Bach
(Walter Carlos).

usual screenshots (nice ones) and humorous content, so
stop in!

One of the better QUAKE spq level review sites has folded.
Bill J. "Crash"  McClendon did an amazing job reviewing
user levels; probably the best map reviews on the WWW, as
a matter of fact. His site was classy and his selection,
impeccable. He also was involved in critiquing and
playtesting dozens of levels... His thorough critiques
were awesome, and helped to get many aspiring authors on
the right track with playability, design issues and the
more technical side of the QUAKE build. We all owe him a
debt of gratitude for his contribution to the QUAKE
community at large.

Go here for a nice farewell from Bill:

RIP, and a moment of silence, for Crash's SPQ QUAKE Page.
