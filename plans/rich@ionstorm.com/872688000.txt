It's official! Hailing all the way from Finland, Iikka
"Fingers" Keranen (Eeka) will be joining Team
ANACHRONOX, filling our last map designer position. If you
collect user QUAKE levels, you are probably already very 
familiar with Iikka's fine work. His infamous (and gorgeous) 
"blue levels" (IKSPQ2, IKSPQ3 & IKSPQ4) have been among the 
best maps seen on the WWW in the last four or five months.

Welcome Iikka!

If you haven't seen his levels, go to his home page
(or CDROM.COM) and check them out!

First, I'd like to get some "thank you's" in:

 To Ken Alverson - Your WBSP is great. And thanks, too, for
  your prompt, knowledgeable and easy-going responses to my
  questions and gripes. You "da man"!

 To Team ANACHRONOX - Tom, Jake, Cleaner, Squirrel, Rocketman
  and Joey: I have difficulty expressing just how much I
  admire all of you, and what a blast is to work with you all.
  This is a "Dream Team" in the truest sense of the word.

 To Ben Herrera, Deanna Molinero and Seneca Menard -
  What can I say? Your work, creatively supervised by our
  own Master of Illuminations, Jerry O'Flaherty, is the
  best in the business. Period. ANACHRONOX lives and
  breathes because of your inspired, fantastic artwork.

 To David McCandless (PC Zone) and Nash Werner (PC Games):
  Two of the nicest guys in the "mag biz" that I've ever
  met. Rock on, dudes!

 To Autolycus (at The Forge) - It's too bad you have to
  hold your finger in the dyke right now with WC... But
  thanks for doing it and your thoughtful updates from
  time to time. Ben owes you one, I think...

 To Coca Cola - Thanks for still making TAB. Without it,
  I'd be 50 lbs. overweight by now, instead of just 20.
  Been with you since circa 1967 or so, and still drinking.
  I figure I'm pre-embalmed with TAB, so when I croak, it
  should save a few bucks on funeral expenses. Anyway, 
  Nutrasweet sux, and everybody knows it.

Okay, that's out of the way. Gotta get this in before I go:

ADELUSION (http://members.aol.com/adelusion/adel.html) has
to be one of the hardest working non-pro map makers around.
DYSTOPIA III, which he made for DOOM2 years ago, is legendary, 
and still, this guy just keeps cranking the classics out. 
His latest, the GOTHIC DEATHMATCH series, is really fun and
QUITE an eyeful. Go to his page and get this. It's well
worth the download time. (Fer Chrissake, why doesn't
somebody hire this guy?)

See ya next time...

*XYZZY!*

July 19, 1997

Spent a little time at QuakeCon...

Saw HEXEN2, which got me all misty-eyed and nostalgic for the
good old days when HERETIC and DOOM ruled the roost... The
guys at RAVEN are cooking up a really cool update. (What I saw
was VERY unfinished, but potentially a classic in the works, IMO.)
Still wondering how they'll top the Morph Ovum (or Porkelator)
this time!

Got to watch THRESH take on ROMERO, PARADOX, VOIN and KILLCREEK.
Dennis whomped them all, one by one. The scores are so embarassing,
I dare not quote them here... Ten dollar bets were happening as to
whether anyone would even get ONE FRAG on the guy... Unfortunately,
I missed the game between Dennis and Noel (SHADOW), but the results
were the same...

THRESH did mention that he has a web site devoted to hardcore
deathmatch strategy. It's called GX: GAMERS EXTREME.
(www.gamers.com) Nice site, Dennis.

TOM HALL held a brief ANACHRONOX Q&A before the ION STORM bash on
Friday night. The questions were good and Tom's comments got quite
a reaction. JAKE ("Strider") HUGHES may have stolen the show, though,
with his video plug for the upcoming short film he's directing, 
FOUR JOKERS.

ION web dude, BILLY HASKINS, performed at the ION STORM party with 
his band, SOCIETY OF THE DAMNED. These guys are absolutely badass. 
Why no "record company" has signed them is a complete mystery to me. 
(Yes. They are THAT GOOD.)

Also, many thanks to Nash Werner and PC Games for the great coverage
at QC.
 
I finally updated my humble homepage, ZDIM'S WEAPON RACK
(www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Alley/6181/index.html), with a link
to THRESH's site, a couple of new QUAKE user levels and some other
cool stuff.

Mixed feelings about SIERRA/VALVE aquiring Worldcraft... I'm happy
for BEN MORRIS, but I'm wondering: What about Worldcraft v2.0?
(promised to registered users "sometime in August") When I emailed
VALVE, I was told that they had made no decisions about future support
and also this:

 "Be assured, however, that we don't plan to shortchange WC users.
  It's not our goal to take a valuable and useful product away from
  the Quake community."

Hmmm...

After emailing SIERRA about this, I received an email ad for a 
couple of their new releases, but no mention of Worldcraft 
whatsoever... (To be fair, I guess the Worldcraft contact man is on 
vacation.)

Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we.

Saw CONTACT last night. 2001 meets Forest Gump (style, not content). 
Zemekis is depending on his tried and true formula, and it works.
Great performances by Foster and Hurt. A bit corny amd cliche, 
especially the "military paranoia" stuff (although I laughed hard at 
Woods's over-the-top performance and outlandish lines). Good story 
(not GREAT, but good). Good fx, especially the "intro bit", the "test 
run" and the "wormhole montage". Fantastic sound. Lousy music.

No apotheosis (yay!), but HEAVY on the deus ex machina, if I may...
(If sci fi is your bag, pick up a couple of David Brin's "Uplift"
novels. His version of the "first contact" story is terrific fun.)

Note: It was a kick to see that the Hubble Space Telescope photos
have finally had an impact on "Hollywood space movies"!

All in all I'd give CONTACT a thumbs up, with a score of three and a
half stars.

Stopped in today to make some "alien tattoo machines" for
ANACHRONOX. Got one that I like, so it's going into the "level".
(Sure hope Tom likes it!)

Downloaded STRAIN for DOOM2. It's a "TC" that I've been waiting for,
since ADELUSION made some levels for it. (ADEL did a great wadpack 
for DOOM2 called DYSTOPIA III, and I've been a fan of his ever 
since.) So I'll be playing that tonight instead of DUNGEON KEEPER.

Well, VOIN just informed me that his handle means "warrior" in
Russian. Cool. (And very appropriate, too.)

For any who may be wondering, "ZDIM", my handle, means "wimpy
keyboard deathmatcher" in Sanskrit. (Actually, it's from the classic
L. Sprague DeCamp fantasy novel, The Fallible Fiend.)

July 4, 1997

Everybody's leaving for the fourth... I'm gonna take over the office, the 
Alpha, and buy a whole bunch of TAB and finally finish that "Yellow 
Submarine Total Conversion for QUAKE" that I've been working on...

VOIN (What does VOIN really mean?) and MAD SOMOAN will model the Blue 
Meanies, Snapping Turtle Turks, Apple Bonkers, Countdown Clowns and the 
Dreadful Flying Glove, as well as various Beatles. SENECA and DEADHORSE 
will be doing the textures and skins. SQUIRREL will do all of the 
programming, as well as sounds, voices and music. I (Zdim) will put the
finishing touches on all of the rather "trippy" levels: Liverpool, The 
Sea of Time, Sea of Science, Sea of Holes, Sea of Green, Nowhereland, The 
Foothills of the Headlands, and, of course, Pepperland. 

The whole TC will be GL QUAKE compatible, with transparent water and really
cool pepper fx that will actually make you sneeze when you play certain 
levels!

We'll skrunch it all into one big pak file and send it up to CDROM.COM by
Monday, and nobody will be any the wiser! (heh heh)

BTW, ROMERO has declined the opportunity to do the deathmatch levels (I 
wonder why?), so I guess we'll just use some leftover Daikatana stuff... 
(SLEEP's "Turkish Delight" level, or SVERRE's abandoned "Laplander's 
Nightmare" level, perhaps...)
