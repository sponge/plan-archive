Factoids:

	I have now seen two reviews of Half-life for PlayStation 2 call the original Half-life for
PC 4 years old.  The original came out in November of 1998, which makes it exactly three years old now.

	The models made for Half-life Dreamcast and the Hi-Definition pack are not the same
as the models in Half-life for PlayStation 2.  The Playstation 2 version has more detailed
models.

	Half-life is NOT based on Quake2.  There is little to no Quake 2 code in Half-life.
All the work Valve did for Half-life was based on the Quake 1 code, of which whole sections
were replaced entirely (skeletal animation model system, entity handling in C++ instead of QuakeC),
and other sections given major rework (16 bit software rendering, EAX and A3D audio, networking).
