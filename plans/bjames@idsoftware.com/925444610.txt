May 25th, 1998

I wanted to take the time out and give a big whopping
thumbs up to ASC Games who, as of late, have been to me
the 'Miramax' of the industry. With games like 'One' for 
the PSX and 'Grand Theft Auto', they're satisfying all of
our little primal urges.

Then comes along 'Sanitarium', which really caught me by
surprise. I don't usually partake in the adventure game 
genre, but the plot-line of insanity and cast of crazy,
deformed, horrific characters makes me feel at home. It's
a great escape that makes me feel like a kid again.

I don't know if it's just me (probably not) but there is 
nothing more satisfying than running around a whacked out
world where inmates are banging their heads against a wall
and religious imagery is present everywhere.

The only game I can compare it to is 'I Have No Mouth and
I Must Scream'. 'Sanitarium' blows it away.

Amen.
