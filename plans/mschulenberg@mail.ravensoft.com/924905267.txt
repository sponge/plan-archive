Cool...the Star Trek: Voyager game has been announced,
as I'm sure most of ya'll (hey I can't help it if I'm
from Texas) have heard by now.  It's a great honor to be
one of the designers for the project.  If you somehow missed
the announcement, I recommend you consult Brian Raffel's 
.plan file.

Later,
