Work on my portion of the Scavenger mission is proceeding nicely.
It's pretty cool getting to build the interior of a derelict, hulking 
mass of a Klingon vessel.  The art guys have been churning out some great
stuff for the level, and it's all starting to become distinctly Klingon.  
I'm especially pleased with how the models and skins for the chairs are
looking...they are a fine example of Klingon decor.  If you're looking
for some more info on the game take a look at Chris Foster's and Mike
Gummelt's .plan files.
	Today I bought some cookies that come in the form of sticks.
They have much honor...
