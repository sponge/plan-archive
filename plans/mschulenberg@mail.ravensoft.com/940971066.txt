A month since the last update...
	I've noticed how some of the other developers do a
worklog-type thing, so I thought I would try one.
	Right, off we go...

* Created a brush.  Put a texture on it.  I didn't like the
texture so I put a different one on it.  It's a much cooler-
looking brush now, I can assure you...

* Liked the brush so much I cloned it and used it again so that
now it is two...two...two times the coolness.

* Created a patch mesh.  Bent it and fit the texture on it x2 and
y2.  Wanted to see what it looked like so I opted to run a BSP.

* A squiggly red line appeared in the editor.  Turns out it was
caused by a leak.  Dragged an edge, fixed the leak.

* Admired the patch mesh for a while.

* Built a door.  It opens and it closes.

* Created another brush.  Sheared it, clipped it, textured it...

* Placed a light and made it red.  It ended up being too bright
in the game.  It's fixed now.

*  MRJ liked my brushes so much he stole them all and put a bunch
of holes in them to start building his level with...vengeance
will be mine =)

Hmmmm, okay, I admit it.  These worklogs are much more interesting
when a programmer is doing it =)
	Seriously, though, work is proceeding nicely on the levels.
We're in the midst of building the last group of levels for the
game.  After this, though, the real work begins, as we have to
start scripting all of them.  So there's still lots of work to do.
I'm really looking forward to seeing how everything is going to
shape up.  Everyone's been doing a spectacular job, and I can't
wait until the game comes together.
