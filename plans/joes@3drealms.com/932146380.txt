Work Stuff:

1) I was interviewed today for the Daily Dementia show.  My "interview" is up online now, over at http://www.dailydementia.com.  It's quite "rambling".  :)

2) Some interesting Web Links I picked up recently.  These are in no particular order, just some things I've looked at recently.

a) http://www.metaspy.com/spymagic/Spy?filter=false
   Shows you the last 11 searches that people searched for on MetaCrawler.

b) http://www.insiders.com/
   Information on various travel brochures.
 
c) http://www.hit-n-run.com/jarjar.html
   Turns any web page (or email) into "Jar Jar Speak"
 
d) http://espn.go.com/editors/mlb/lostparks/index.html
   Nice piece by ESPN on several baseball parks that are going away.
