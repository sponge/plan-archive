Stuff:

1) I just updated the Dopefish site with some pictures of a guy who dressed up as Dopefish for Halloween.  They're pretty damn funny - go check it out at http://www.dopefish.com.

2) Does anyone know where you can get the Stephen King short story "Rita Hayworth & the Shawshank Redemption"?  My wife and I love the movie, and I'd be curious to read his original short story.

3) Does anyone have the Flash Gordon (1980) DVD?  If so, drop me a line, please.  Was wondering if there was any kind of extra stuff on this.

CD's I'm listening to:

1) Queen - Greatest Hits
2) Brian May - Another World (it's kinda a Brian May Day :)
3) Tom Petty - Greatest Hits
4) The Simpsons - Songs in the Key of Springfield
