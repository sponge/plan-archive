Non Work Stuff:

1) Well, the Bill Clinton fiasco has finally invaded Star Trek.  Did anyone catch the "Bride of Chaotica" episode of Star Trek: Voyager last night?  Well, the entire episode was based around Tom Paris' holodeck recreation of 1930's Sci-Fi Serials like Flash Gordon.  Anyway, as part of it, they recruited the Doctor to play the President of Earth.  After the Doctor does his thing, he walks into the ship where Tom Paris & Harry Kim are.  The Doctor says "Well, isn't anyone going to play Hail to the Chief?"   To which, Tom says something like "Hello, Mr. President, how did it go?" and the Doctor says "My performance was unimpeachable."  Man, I was laughing so hard, I couldn't hear the dialogue for a minute or two.  I just did not see that coming.  Absolutely great moment in a very differnt Star Trek episode.  They don't always hit, but I love it when Trek does something radically different like this (the bulk of the episode was in Black and White).

2) Saw Black Sabbath in Dallas Sunday night.  I'm hurting.  It rocked, of course.  I'll write a review in the next day or so, and it'll be on my Black Sabbath site at http://www.black-sabbath.com.

3) Did anyone happen to catch the Rear Window remake about two months ago with Christopher Reeve?  If so, please drop me a line.


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Brian May - Another World (Very highly recommended)
2) Roger Waters - Amused to Death
3) Black Sabbath - Master of Reality, Sabotage, Never Say Die, Reunion
3) Dario Mollo - The Cage
