Does anyone reading this remember the feature with NSI's (now Verisign's) whois lookup where you could search for all domain names owned by a company?  You used to be able to plug in name of company and see all the domains registered to them.  I can't figure out how to do it anymore.

I was going over the master list of domains our company owns.  I have a big list, but I wanted to search through their registry to see if there's any we registered that I missed for some reason.

If anyone can figure out how to do this, please email me at joes@3drealms.com.  Thanks.
