Our Web Forums have developed a corrupted user file index.  I've had to turn them off until I can figure out how to fix the index.  I shouldn't lose any user files, as I have a fairly recent backup, but anyone who signed up today (8/16) might be lost.  I'll report back when I find out what's going on.

Go check out http://www.3drealms.com.  We released a sound sample from the Megadeth recording of the Duke Nukem Theme song.  It's quite cool.  Available in MP3 or RM format, you can download it today and catch a snippet of the Duke Nukem: Music to Score by CD which is due out on August 24th.
