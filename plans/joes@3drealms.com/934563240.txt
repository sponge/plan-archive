Testing to see which of the finger archive sites pick up this.  If you can see this, then the place you're reading from is reading the 3D Realms fingers correctly.

Go check out http://www.3drealms.com.  We released a sound sample from the Megadeth recording of the Duke Nukem Theme song.  It's quite cool.  Available in MP3 or RM format, you can download it today and catch a snippet of the Duke Nukem: Music to Score by CD which is due out on August 24th.
