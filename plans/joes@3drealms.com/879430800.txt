Slight update to my Netscape remark below.  If you want the AOL
Instant Messenger software, you need to get either the "Complete
Install" or the "Professional Edition".   The "Base Install" &
the "Standalone" versions do not have it.

Netscape 4.04 is out.  If you've been using Netscape v4 series, then
you should grab this.  It's MUCH more stable than the other v4 series
releases are, and there's two big things in this one that I've been
looking for for a long time.  Well, OK, the first one I have.  The 
second one is just cool.

1) Native PNG support
2) AOL Instant Messenger

What's #2?  Well, it's basically what ICQ is, but the hub is not ICQ,
it's AOL itself, which means you can also interact with the existing
AOL subscriber base.  I'm an ICQ user (no, I won't give out my number,
I have too many people trying to contact me already), but I like this
software.  Plus, it comes bundled with Netsacape v4.04.  It's pretty
cool.

Personal:
---------

Saw Starship Troopers.  I agree with John Romero.  Man are there GIBS
everywhere.  There is one thing that happens to someone in this movie
that we saw in Terminator 2 that annoyed me.  Remember when Linda 
Hamilton got speared in the shoulder towards the end of the movie, and
then when let go, she was acting as if nothing at all happened?  Same
thing happened to someone in Starship Troopers (again near the end).
Bugs the shit out of me when that happens.  Yeah, yeah, I know it's a
movie, but still...

Also, I'll say this.  If you don't like bugs, and get nightmares from
them, DO NOT see this movie.  :)

I'll give it an 7.5 out of 10.  Probably won't rent it when it comes out
on tape.  Once was enough.  Next up for me is Bean.
