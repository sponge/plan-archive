Web Stuff:

A lot of good feedback on the new web layout.  I haven't seen a
single bad message about it.  We new it was good, but quite frankly,
I'm surprised NO ONE said anything bad about it.  Hell, I've even
gotten a few messages from some of my friends in the industry saying
they wish their sites looked like that.  :)

Movie Stuff:

I saw a movie I think I might be the only person in the industry to
go see.  HERCULES.  Yes, *THAT* Hercules.  I actually enjoyed it.
I'm truly beginning to believe that I'm not the same as everyone else
in the industry.  I go see Disney movies in the theatres.  :)

Cool Stuff:

We got a pinball machine in the office today.  A real machine, it's
called...  Oh crap, I can't remember the name of it right now, but
it's got the word "Stiff" in the title, and it is Elvira themed.
(Yeah I know I could walk over there and find out what it is, but 
hey, this is the gaming industry, aren't we supposed to be lazy? :)

Speaking of the pinball machine, I currently rock over everyone else
who has played it.  I'm the only one to place on the machine's high
score list.  Pfffft to everyone else.   I've also got the highest
scores of anyone internally at Apogee on Balls of Steel, too.  :)

Balls of Steel:

That reminds me.  There's a really cool feature I like in Balls of 
Steel, where it will coordinate high scores around the world from
people who play the game (so long as they have a TCP/IP connection).
It's really cool, and you'll be able to see how you rank against
other players (including us) around the globe.  I can't wait for this
to come out and play with some of y'all. 

Personal Stuff:

Got a washer and dryer yesterday.  Exciting stuff, eh?  It is for me.
For the first time since I moved to Texas to take the job with Apogee
(which was November of 1992), I don't have to plunk quarters into the
stupid white boxes that clean my clothes.  Yaay!   Now they can go for
other things, like buying more CD's.  :)

Work Stuff:

Our new web site is online.  It's a total redesign.  It's more
or less the same content, but in a whole new package.  It's 
the best it's ever been.  Make sure to visit us at 
http://www.apogee1.com or http://www.3drealms.com.  (They both go
to the same place).   

I want to thank Brian Cozzens for his help with this.  All the 
graphics for the new site layout (the blue/green look) were done
by him.  The basic site layout was also his idea.  The new stuff
couldn't have been done without him.

Check it out, and if you have any feedback on it, please send
me some E-mail.  It's designed for 800x600.  If you have 640x480
it's gonna look like crap.  Besides, the web shouldn't be browsed
at 640x480, anyway!

Personal Stuff:

Yesterday was my 10 year anniversary of meeting my (now) wife.  I
met her on July 17, 1987 for the first time at a diner in New Jersey
along Route 73 called "Olga's Diner".   Took us 9 years to get 
engaged, and then 4 months to get married.  :)

Quakecon:

I'm not there.  I really wanted to go last night, but had a personal
committment I didn't want to break.  Aromo, you would have to come down
here at some bizarre hour, would you?  :)

CD's I'm listening to:
----------------------

Haven't changed over the last couple of days.  Still listening
to the same ones.  I'm stuck on Operation Mindcrime again.  
Queensryche is coming here August 16th; I'm going.   I saw them
on their Building Empires tour when they did *ALL* of Operation
Mindcrime live; it was AWESOME!

Personal Stuff:

I'm domesticated now, I guess.  I bought a washer and dryer with 
my wife this weekend.  :)

New Web Site:

I'm about 2/3 through the new web site.  All I have left is the
product catalog, which I'm going to start on later today.  I'm
hoping I can get this online before or during QuakeCon (which
I'll probably turn up at).  More on that later.

Movie Stuff:

I also saw "Contact" on Friday night.  Let me say this.  This is
a movie I've been waiting to see for a long LONG time.  This is a
movie that doesn't "dumb down" to the audience.  There's more than
a few places where it could have taken the low road, like so many
of Hollywood's movies do anymore, but they didn't.  I was so happy
with this movie, it's insane.

However, if you like things blowing up, or "Arnold" type movies, this
is not for you.  This movie requires you to listen to the dialogue, it
requires you to actually *THINK*, which was so refreshing in a movie.
I was so glad someone made an intelligent movie.    If you want to go 
to a movie seeing things blow up, or hoping to catch a glimpse of 
Jodie Foster in a state of undress, don't go.  If you go to movies for
things like that, this is not your cup of tea.  It's got some 
class, unlike a lot of the entertainment on the big screen these
days.  :)   There, I've had my say.

Go see Contact.  It's great!

CD's I'm Listening To:

Geezer - Black Science
Megadeth - Cryptic Writings
Queensryche - Operation Mindcrime
Bill Ward - When the Bough Breaks
Motley Crue - Generation Swine (gets better after a few listenings)

Life Found on Mars!  It's a big coverup, but life has been
found on Mars!  Go here: http://duke.intersphere.com/ for
the details...

In other news, I'm making a bunch of progress on the new 
layout.  We've finally gotten the layout locked in for the
new look, and Whaleboy has got all the graphics done, now
it's up to me to recode the pages.  I estimate I'm about
50-60% done with it.

Did a bunch more work on the new site yesterday.  The format
is down, I now have to do the work on converting the couple of
hundred pages that make up our entire web site.  Just did a 
quick check, and it's around 706 html pages for the ENTIRE 
site.

I'll see if I can get a screen shot of the "new look" front
page.  Oh yeah, and the new web logos do *NOT* look like the
ones on Preystation.  :)

Congratulations to David Graves.  He was the first person to
send me the correct URL to the hidden Duke Nukem Forever
screen shot that was hidden on the Virtual Tour.

That's it.  For the record, that's Allen Blum's monitor, and
what you see in the corner there is part of the editor being
used for Duke Nukem Forever.   Yeah, it's "weak", but hey, we
can't give away all our secrets this soon, can we?  :)

The thing in the front with the purple cube sitting on it is
a casino table (at least one of the DNF levels will take place
in Las Vegas)

CD's I'm listening to today:

OzzFest '97 CD
Megadeth - Cryptic Writings
Black Sabbath - Cross Purposes

Work Stuff:

Work is progressing on the new look for our web site.  Brian
Cozzens has been doing some nice work on the new art, and then I
have the daunting task of converting over all of our pages to the
new look. The Virtual Tour alone has like 184 pages!  Ack!  For
long time visitors to our site, it'll be the nicest looking thing
we've done. Brian's done a bangup job getting this all together.
Look for it in July sometime (if all goes well).

Comment on Dallas:

Saw the weather forcast for here Wednesday.  First forecasted 100
degree day.  Sometimes I miss living up north, and the 100 degree
days are usually those days.  I miss SNOW!  I love it when you
get 24 inches of snow in like 4 hours.  Now *THAT* is winter!
Dallas is pathetic in the winter.  For those of you who live up
north, you'll laugh at this.  Dallas gets (No bullshit here, this
is the truth) a SINGLE INCH of snow, and the town shuts down.
It's hysterical! The people down here freak out when any snow
happens.  And they put *SAND* on the highways.  Uh, people.  Get
a clue.  That doesn't do anything.  Use *SALT!*   I especially
loved it on Thanksgiving back in 1993 when the snow was all over
the field for a Dallas Cowboys game, and Leon Lett (I think)
dropped the ball, and the team lost. HAHA!  I hate the Cowboys.
Everyone should.

CD Stuff:

I've been posting CD's I've been listening to when I write a
finger update, and I've had several comments on what I listen to.
Well, I went and decided to publish my entire CD collection on
the web.   A few updates ago, I mentioned a really bitchin CD
program that works off the CDDB database on the Internet.  It's
called DiscPlay (v4.03), and you can read about it, and get it at
http://www.obvion.com/discplay/.   If you play CD's on your
computer, you **NEED** this.  It's too awesome.

Anyway, one of the features is an HTML Export, and that's what I
did.  If you want to see my CD collection, go here:

Movie Review:

I saw Batman & Robin on Saturday.  One comment. Alicia
Silverstone is **WRONG** WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG!  God, who was
looking at a pinup poster of her when they cast her?   She can't
act worth a rats spit.  There was only about a 15 seconds when I
bought it, and that's when she was on a batbike with the ears on.
She *LOOKED* the part then. Otherwise, she was wrong.  The only
problem becomes who else do you cast as Batgirl?  The only person
I could think of was Liv Tyler, but I think she's too tall for
the role, you don't want BatGirl taller than Batman.

Overall, the movie was OK.  It didn't suck, like a lot of people
are saying, but it wasn't the best, either.  The first one is
still the best, but that's probably because of Jack Nickolson.
Positive stuff about this movie..  I did like a lot of the one
liners, even if some of them were a bit predictable (There's a
*LOT* of "cool" and "ice" jokes from Arnold).  Also, for the
first time in the three times they've had "double villians", the
two villains seemed to work well together.  The Penguin &
Catwoman just DID not interact hardly at all.  The Riddler and
TwoFace?  Two Face was totally superflous.  However, Freeze &
Poison Ivy were great.  I'm not a big Uma Thurman fan, but she
really looked good here.  Great job by her.

The problem with Batman movies now is something I thought of
after the first movie.  Eventually you'll run out of villians.
Granted, from the first two movies, Catwoman & the Riddler are
still alive, so they could return (I'm not saying what happens to
Freeze & Poison Ivy).  They say the Scarecrow will be in the next
Batman movie, but I don't remember that villian at all.  The
"Dark Knight" aspect of the movie series is all but gone.  I like
Clooney, but I keep seeing "Doug Ross" in there. That's not to
say he didn't do a good job, he does, but when your TV show is
the #1 series, you're going to need some time to break from your
already established TV character.   Should there be a fifth one?
Yeah, there should be.  However, the quality isn't as good as it
was in the beginning.  I wish they wouldn't have killed the Joker
in the first one, he was the best villian.

Mike Tyson:

Who cares?  Boxing is lame, anyway.

Duke Nukem Forever:

A couple of weeks ago, I updated the Virtual Tour on our web
site, and put in a small screen shot of Duke Nukem Forever 
that's hidden in
