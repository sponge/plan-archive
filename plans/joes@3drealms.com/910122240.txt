Work Stuff:

1) In regards to the Top 10 List I posted the other day, I wanted to point out that I figured y'all would pick up on the fact that it was a joke by the fact that I put "Top 10 List" as the number one item in my own Top 10 List.  Guess not.

2) Upgraded our UBB Forum Software today.  This one should be much faster than the old one.  There's a short news bit about it on the 3D Realms site.

3) Found a place that is selling the SWAT Duke Action Figure.  Details on the 3D Realms site.


Personal Stuff:

1) Screw the NBA.  I say they cancel the entire SPORT, not just the season.

2) Does anyone know of a decent time management/planner system other than Franklin Covey or DayTimer?  Drop me a line. 

3) I just noticed that the Sony S300 DVD player has dropped $100 to about $399 across the board.  That's the one I'm planning on buying this Xmas, so that was a very nice surprise. :)

4) Got a new movie poster for my office - this one is for Star Trek: Insurrection.  Really awesome place to buy movie posters - http://www.movieposters.net.

5) Fnord to the two people who Emailed me about my Top 10 insisting that I tell them who I was commenting about (assuming it was them - you were both wrong).

 
CD's I'm listening to:

1) Black Sabbath - Reunion
2) Aerosmith - Nine Lives
3) Creedence Clearwater Revival - Chronicle
4) Fleetwood Mac - The Dance
5) Joe Satriani - The Extremist
