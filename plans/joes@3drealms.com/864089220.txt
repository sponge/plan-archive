I've decided I'm not going to write about the same old stuff that you
see on all these other fingers, mine's gonna be non work related
usually.  :)

BTW, I saw George go "Waaah" over getting 200 pieces of E-mail. 
 Pffft.
I can do that asleep.  I get over 1,000 a day.  :)

Anyone else out there have a USRobotics Pilot?  When Tom Hall (of Ion
Storm) was at my wedding (Yeah! Tom was in my wedding), he showed me 
his
Pilot, and I was hooked. I love the thing!  Also, Paul Schuytema and 
Tom
Pytel of 3D Realms also have 'em, and I was wondering who else in 
this
industry has 'em.
