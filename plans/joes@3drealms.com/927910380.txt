Work Stuff:

1) Testing 1-2-3.  Making sure this finger service is still picked up with the new DNS propogations.

2) Our websites are all moved over to the new server.  All web sites have had their DNSs updated, and you should see the correct info if you go to http://www.3drealms.com.  If you don't, bug the people who take care of your DNS to update.


Other Stuff:

1) Does anyone know of any kind of web based service that will email you comic strips daily to your inbox?  I'm talking about the majors like Dilbert, etc...   Best I can find is to set up IE5 to scan daily for changes, and email the page to you.  Was wondering if there was any other way to do it.

2) OH DEAR GOD!  I just read they're making a damned PARTRIDGE FAMILY movie!   Help!  Someone blow up Hollywood even if it means the Duke Nukem movie never gets made!  ACK!
