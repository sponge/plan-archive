Work Stuff:

1) Seems like someone has a BIG case of jealousy over Blue's popularity.  

2) I'm going to be out of the office on vacation next week from the 11th to the 22nd.  Bryan Turner will be handling news updates on our site while I'm away.


Other Stuff:

1) Is anyone going to be in the DFW area on Friday September 18th?  I have a pair of tickets to the Texas Rangers/Oakland A's game that I need to get rid of.  They're in Section 39, if anyone knows the Ballpark in Arlington.   If you might be interested in these, drop me a line.   Asking face value, which is $25 each.

2) Someone asked me what other web sites I do.  Here's a list for the totally bored.  :)

http://www.3drealms.com                (Official Site)
http://www.black-sabbath.com           (Official Unofficial Site)
http://www.billward.com                (Official Site)
http://www.cozypowell.com              (Official Site)
http://www.dopefish.com                (Official Site)
http://www.metronet.com/~apogee/chef/  (Fan Site for a BBC Sitcom called Chef!)
http://www.geocities.com/heartland/3674/gromit.html  (Page about Wallace & Gromit)

In addition the sites I do for members of Black Sabbath listed above (Bill Ward & Cozy Powell), I'm about to do another one for another person who was in Black Sabbath, but I don't want to say who it is until the deal is 100% finalized.

Also, I'm going to be moving the last two to a new location shortly.


CD's I'm listening to:

1) The Beatles - Sgt Pepper's
2) Back to Titanic Soundtrack
3) Bruce Springsteen - Greatest Hits
