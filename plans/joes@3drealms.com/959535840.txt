Personal Request:

Is there anyone who is attending the Roger Waters concert in Dallas (on Sunday June 11th) who needs a SINGLE ticket?  I purchased a ticket, and due to some extenuating circumstances, I cannot use it.  However, Ticketmaster doesn't allow you refunds, so I now have to find a way to sell the ticket myself.

If you're interested, please email me for details on seat location, etc, but please do it before Wednesday.  Thanks.
