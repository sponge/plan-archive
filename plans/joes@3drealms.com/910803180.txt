Work Stuff:

1) OK, it's not work stuff, but...  The movie poster for Star Wars Episode I is out.  Go check it out at http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/news/1998/46/. No spoilers. Check it out. Looks sweet.

2) There's a server problem that's preventing me from updating 3drealms.com and maxpayne.com.  It hopefully should be resolved today and I can post pending updates for both of the sites.


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Rolling Stones - Dirty Work
2) Rush - Chronicles Disc 2  (Man, I forgot how much I liked Subdivisions)
3) Rainbow - Stranger in Us All
4) Brian May - Another World (A really great album)
