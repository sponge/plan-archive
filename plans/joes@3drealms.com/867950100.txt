Did a bunch more work on the new site yesterday.  The format
is down, I now have to do the work on converting the couple of
hundred pages that make up our entire web site.  Just did a 
quick check, and it's around 706 html pages for the ENTIRE 
site.

I'll see if I can get a screen shot of the "new look" front
page.  Oh yeah, and the new web logos do *NOT* look like the
ones on Preystation.  :)

Congratulations to David Graves.  He was the first person to
send me the correct URL to the hidden Duke Nukem Forever
screen shot that was hidden on the Virtual Tour.

That's it.  For the record, that's Allen Blum's monitor, and
what you see in the corner there is part of the editor being
used for Duke Nukem Forever.   Yeah, it's "weak", but hey, we
can't give away all our secrets this soon, can we?  :)

The thing in the front with the purple cube sitting on it is
a casino table (at least one of the DNF levels will take place
in Las Vegas)

CD's I'm listening to today:

OzzFest '97 CD
Megadeth - Cryptic Writings
Black Sabbath - Cross Purposes

Work Stuff:

Work is progressing on the new look for our web site.  Brian
Cozzens has been doing some nice work on the new art, and then I
have the daunting task of converting over all of our pages to the
new look. The Virtual Tour alone has like 184 pages!  Ack!  For
long time visitors to our site, it'll be the nicest looking thing
we've done. Brian's done a bangup job getting this all together.
Look for it in July sometime (if all goes well).

Comment on Dallas:

Saw the weather forcast for here Wednesday.  First forecasted 100
degree day.  Sometimes I miss living up north, and the 100 degree
days are usually those days.  I miss SNOW!  I love it when you
get 24 inches of snow in like 4 hours.  Now *THAT* is winter!
Dallas is pathetic in the winter.  For those of you who live up
north, you'll laugh at this.  Dallas gets (No bullshit here, this
is the truth) a SINGLE INCH of snow, and the town shuts down.
It's hysterical! The people down here freak out when any snow
happens.  And they put *SAND* on the highways.  Uh, people.  Get
a clue.  That doesn't do anything.  Use *SALT!*   I especially
loved it on Thanksgiving back in 1993 when the snow was all over
the field for a Dallas Cowboys game, and Leon Lett (I think)
dropped the ball, and the team lost. HAHA!  I hate the Cowboys.
Everyone should.

CD Stuff:

I've been posting CD's I've been listening to when I write a
finger update, and I've had several comments on what I listen to.
Well, I went and decided to publish my entire CD collection on
the web.   A few updates ago, I mentioned a really bitchin CD
program that works off the CDDB database on the Internet.  It's
called DiscPlay (v4.03), and you can read about it, and get it at
http://www.obvion.com/discplay/.   If you play CD's on your
computer, you **NEED** this.  It's too awesome.

Anyway, one of the features is an HTML Export, and that's what I
did.  If you want to see my CD collection, go here:

Movie Review:

I saw Batman & Robin on Saturday.  One comment. Alicia
Silverstone is **WRONG** WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG!  God, who was
looking at a pinup poster of her when they cast her?   She can't
act worth a rats spit.  There was only about a 15 seconds when I
bought it, and that's when she was on a batbike with the ears on.
She *LOOKED* the part then. Otherwise, she was wrong.  The only
problem becomes who else do you cast as Batgirl?  The only person
I could think of was Liv Tyler, but I think she's too tall for
the role, you don't want BatGirl taller than Batman.

Overall, the movie was OK.  It didn't suck, like a lot of people
are saying, but it wasn't the best, either.  The first one is
still the best, but that's probably because of Jack Nickolson.
Positive stuff about this movie..  I did like a lot of the one
liners, even if some of them were a bit predictable (There's a
*LOT* of "cool" and "ice" jokes from Arnold).  Also, for the
first time in the three times they've had "double villians", the
two villains seemed to work well together.  The Penguin &
Catwoman just DID not interact hardly at all.  The Riddler and
TwoFace?  Two Face was totally superflous.  However, Freeze &
Poison Ivy were great.  I'm not a big Uma Thurman fan, but she
really looked good here.  Great job by her.

The problem with Batman movies now is something I thought of
after the first movie.  Eventually you'll run out of villians.
Granted, from the first two movies, Catwoman & the Riddler are
still alive, so they could return (I'm not saying what happens to
Freeze & Poison Ivy).  They say the Scarecrow will be in the next
Batman movie, but I don't remember that villian at all.  The
"Dark Knight" aspect of the movie series is all but gone.  I like
Clooney, but I keep seeing "Doug Ross" in there. That's not to
say he didn't do a good job, he does, but when your TV show is
the #1 series, you're going to need some time to break from your
already established TV character.   Should there be a fifth one?
Yeah, there should be.  However, the quality isn't as good as it
was in the beginning.  I wish they wouldn't have killed the Joker
in the first one, he was the best villian.

Mike Tyson:

Who cares?  Boxing is lame, anyway.

Duke Nukem Forever:

A couple of weeks ago, I updated the Virtual Tour on our web
site, and put in a small screen shot of Duke Nukem Forever 
that's hidden in the tour somewhere.  I'm surprised no one has
found it.  :)  (It's VERY small, and you can't see the entire
picture, but it *IS* there, and it *IS* from DNF.  :)

June 23rd:

Well, everyone is back from E3.  I didn't go, (Waaaah!) so I have no
news to report.

I did see a movie over the weekend, though.  I saw "My Best Friend's
Wedding".  Julia Roberts still looks cool.   The ending wasn't what I
was expecting.  Lot of fun.  The "mush" factor is pretty low, it's a
really funny movie, I thought.  Check it out if you at all like 
Julia Roberts, and if you at all like comedies.  It's pretty cool.

I also heard from three seperate news sources over the weekend that 
after James Cameron is done with "Titanic", he and Arnold are going
to be doing a Terminator 3.  That oughta rock.  

CD's I'm listening to:

Dio - Angry Machines
Black Sabbath - Forbidden
Goldeneye Soundtrack
Def Leppard - Slang

June 13th:

Here's a fact that probably no one will care about.  :)  I got engaged
one year ago today.  What are me and my wife doing?  Going to a Texas
Rangers game tonight.  If you ever have seen the Dallas skyline, you
know that building that has a ball on the top?  That's a restuarant
(among other things) called Antares.  That's where it happened, and
we're going there on Saturday evening.

Anyway, I was poking around the web again, and it appears that someone 
has hacked the Official "Speed 2" movie site over at
(http://www.speed2-cruisecontrol.com).  Unless it's been fixed by the
time you see it, it's simply one line of text.  It says "Overall nice
special effects, but the screen play seems to have been written with
a crayon - Someone who has a clue".  Not to mention the title of the
page was "Speed 2 - Cruise Control - a movie that sinks like the boat
in the movied".  :)  I don't plan on seeing this movie, mainly 
because it looks like crap, but I found this funny anyway.  :)

UPDATE: It's been fixed.  :(

I am planning on seeing Batman & Robin and My Best Friend's Wedding
this month.  The parallels between the Julia Roberts flick and me 
and my wife's own wedding are very VERY similar.

Other Miscelleanous stuff:

- I'm also one of the only people here not going to E3.
- We're working on a new front page "look" for our web site,
  with some help from Brian Cozzens.  Should be online after 
  E3, I'd wager.
- I also found out that my friend Joe Selinske over at Terminal Reality
  will now be working (as producer) with the guys over at
  Hipnotic/Ritual/Whatever-they're-called-this-week Entertainment.
  Joe's been a good friend of mine for the last 4 years, I wish 
  him well there! Hey Joe, I guess the "L" Gesture is not called
  for here, eh? :)
- The Altec Lansing speakers Scott Miller spoke of *DO ROCK*.  I 
  plugged mine in this morning, and boy do they sound great.  Not
  to mention they're very stylish looking.
- I see Paul put Tony Iommi on his list, but he's still not at the
  top.  Come on Paul, you can do better than that!  :)
- I'm still waiting for a response to my request to fix the problem
  with our Live Shot Camera.  I'm having some software problems with
  it.  I didn't make a backup of the old capture software, and now 
  I can only take one picture at a time w/o rebooting the computer.
  Not good when you want to run an auto repeating capture system, eh?

CD's I'm listening to:

Dio - Holy Diver & The Last in Line
Pat Benatar - Inammorata (new stuff - pretty good)
Bobby Prince's Doom Music CD

Book I'm reading:
Doctor Who: Lungbarrow by Marc Platt

June 3rd:

This past Sunday, I went to see OzzFest with Richard Gray from
Hipnotic and another friend of mine Steve Quarrella (Gee, two ex
Apogeers :).  Anyway, this thing totally rocked.  Well, Ozzy &
Black Sabbath did.  The rest of the people blow, so we intentionally
went late.  It totally rocks.  Even without Bill Ward there, it
was awesome.  If you'd care to read my review of the concert, it's
over at my Black Sabbath site at http://www.black-sabbath.com under
Concert Reviews.
