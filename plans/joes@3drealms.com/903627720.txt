Work Stuff:

1) The new (4th) issue of the 3D Realms Newsletter is out and about now.  If you're not on the list, you should be.  It's free.  If you're not on it, you can sign up here:
http://www.3drealms.com/tech/mailinglist.html.  If you want to _see_ the last newsletter, you can read it here: http://www.3drealms.com/news/cnn4.txt.

2) There's a really cool book out called Speeding the Net : The Inside Story of Netscape and How It Challenged Microsoft.  It gives some insight into the background of Netscape.  It's a good read.  Go check it out here: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0871137097/chefinternetA.


Other Stuff:

0) Today's my birthday.  Number 33.  Fnord.

1) Anyone who plays Hardball 6?  If so, please Email me.

2) Anyone have any old Atari 2600 carts lying around they don't want anymore?  Email me.

3) Bruce Springsteen has reuinted with the E Street Band.  Thank god.  I've been a Bruce fan for a long time, but that Ghost of Tom Johd (sp?) album he had about two years ago was horrible.

4) Wall of Sound has a poll online where you can vote for your fav albums of the 70's.  It's pretty cool, actually.  http://www.wallofsound.com/.


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Genesis - Calling All Stations
2) Yngwie J. Malmsteen - Facing the Animal
3) Bill Ward - When the Bough Breaks
4) Black Sabbath - Mob Rules
5) Geezer - Black Science

Regarding Yngwie, the J is to differentiate him from all the other Yngwie Malmsteens out there.
