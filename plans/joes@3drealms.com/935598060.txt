1) All pending Camera Captioning Winner Prizes were mailed out today.  The reason they were not sent, even though they had been picked was that I ran out of gift certificate paper.  Since I couldn't print any gift certificates, there was no prize to send out.  :)

I got the stuff in late last week, and printed up some yesterday, and they all went out in the mail (including the contest that ended Monday, too).   If you won one of these, your prize was sent out today.

Also, I noticed some recent confusion.  Someone who was one of the "runners up" I always post thought that they too got a prize.  It's only the winning entry person that gets the prize, the others are put up there so they can be seen too, but they don't get a prize.  Sorry.

2) Blech - I turned 34 last week.  I'm getting old.  But not as old as Levelord.    Hi Richard!  :)
