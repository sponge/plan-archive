Misc Stuff:

1) I don't know how new this is, but I just ran into this over the weekend.  There's a company called Digital Stream that is/was (I'm not 100% sure of the status here, actually) that was talking to Paramount about updating the special effects of the Star Trek Classic episodes.   If you go visit their web site, they have some still images, and two mpg samples from the episode "The Doomsday Machine" that show off a sample of their work mixed in with the existing footage.  It actually looks COOL!  One of the problems with the original show over time is that the sfx are downright hokey.  I love Trek Classic, and watched it from very young childhood - I know them well.  

I was 1 when the show started, and my father tells me that was mom's Bridge night, so he got to babysit me and put me in a playpen while Star Trek and Wild, Wild, West were on.  :)

Anyways, go to their site at http://www.digistream.com and check out the samples.  I rather like these (even though the Doomsday Machine itself looks a little too "pink"), and would absolutely love for them to actually get a contract to do these.  

2) I got my Pilot III upgrade late last week.  It's way cool, but now I need someone else with a Pilot III so I can test out the beaming feature.  :)
