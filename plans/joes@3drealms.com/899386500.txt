FUCK YOU!

Write real news you moronic jackass, and don't make up shit.  Sites like yours solely exist to push your own name - report on real news, or at least verify what you say.  

You don't even have the balls to say who you are.  I dare you to come out (Hmm.. Come out) and say who you really are.

My finger is mine, and I can write what I want.  You don't like what I write, fine.  Don't read it.  Don't go and make up bullshit stories about me because of it.   I didn't see you saying anything when someone (I honestly don't remember his name now) over at Ion Storm was putting background colours and huge pictures in his plan file, corrupting the Quakefinger page.  Why don't you say he was hanging out with RuPaul or something?

Piss me off, why don't you?

Go look at my last two plan updates - there's a lot of stuff in there.
