Work Stuff:

1 - Does anyone know of an app that will take a group of files 

that is really large, and split it up over several CD's to burn?  

I have a few gigs of data I want to backup to a few CD's, and 

don't want to spend the time to optimize the data into groups so 

it will fit over several CD's.  There's got to be an app that 

will do this.  (And please don't go tell me to back up to DVD - 

that's not an option here).

Non Work Stuff:

1 - I have had a few emails asking me what I've been listening to 

lately, as I haven't published a list in awhile..

CD's I've been listening to lately:

1) Dio - Killing the Dragon (new - and awesome)
2) Deep Purple - Purpendicular & Perfect Strangers
3) Pat Benatar - Innamorata
4) Judas Priest mix CD
5) My "all bands I have CD's for" random mix CD's :)
