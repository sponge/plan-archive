Lee Jackson's finger is offline.  I pointed out to him that
QuakeFinger's script was choking trying to read his .plan. He
did some checking, and found out that his provider (nstar.net)
has decided that "for security's sake", they were going to
remove all non local access to the .plan files, which means
that anyone outside of nstar.net can't read Lee's .plan file.

We are supposed to be getting our own net access in November
(if all goes well), and at that time, (I'm told) everyone here
will have their own E-Mail and .plan files, so we shouldn't
have these problems (and there will be real email addresses,
not this joe.siegler@jefferson.gte.net stuff).

I've also been told that myself, Scott, George, & Paul could
also lose our .plan access for the same reason as nstar
claimed.  I'm hoping our current ISP will let us carry on till
then.

Due to popular demand, I put a picture of Stephen Cole's desk
on the net.  http://www.dopefish.com/2.jpg.  Check it out.  :)
The number of cups has increased radically since I took that
picture.

Personal Stuff:
---------------

* Man, I bowled some awesome stuff last Thursday.  191-210-182.
  It's been awhile since I bowled like that.  :)

* I agree with Scott.  If you're on MNF and need a field goal
  to win the game, forget it.  Go for the touchdown.  If you
  want to get in on a national "Football Pool", go here:

  That's ESPN's "Pigskin Pick 'em".  You can play against
  pretty much the world in picking games.  And it's the way I
  like it, straight up.  None of this point nonsense.

* Speaking of links, there's a really cool page out there for
  an emulator called MAME, which lets you play original arcade
  ROM's.  Not a port, but the _REAL_ roms. Check it out at:
