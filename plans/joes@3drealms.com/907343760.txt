Work Stuff:

1) There's a new poll up on our web site.  It asks "What was the first Duke Nukem game you ever played?" - Head to www.3drealms.com and click on "Polls" to vote in it.

2) I've also got a bunch of stuff about "Duke Nukem: Time to Kill" on the site now too if you haven't seen it.  There's more to come, too.



Personal:

1) I had a great time visiting family - was a lot of fun, and I also had forgotten how much "greener" Pennsylvania is than Texas. 

2) My wife and I are going to be buying a DVD player around Xmas time, and are looking at these two models.  Was wondering if anyone actually has them, and if so, what your "real world" experience is with these.  A) Panasonic A-110  B) Sony DVP-S300D or S500D  Would appreciate some comments on these if you have a minute.  Specifically looking for reliability and quality type stuff, but I'd appreciate anything you  know about these units.

3) Man, do the Eagles suck this year.  :)
