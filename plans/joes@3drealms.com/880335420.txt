November 23rd
-------------
Just released the Shadow Warrior 3DFX Patches.  Go to our web
site, and pick "News".  There's a link for it there.  That's
about all I have to say about that. 

Now on to finishing Balls of Steel.  :)

Personal:

Today was the 34th anniversary of the airing of the first episode
of Doctor Who in England.  That's one of my top five fav shows, 
and if you ask, William Hartnell is my fav doctor.

CD's I'm Listening To:
---------------------
Pink Floyd - The Delicate Sound of Thunder
AC/DC - Ballbreaker
Bill Ward - When the Bough Breaks
