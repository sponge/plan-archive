December 12th

Here's the totally useless file of the day.  You know that Volkswagen commercial
with the two guys and the stinky chair?   Found a Quicktime movie of that.
If you want it, it's here:

ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/msdos/games/apogee/misc/dadada.mov.

It's about 1.8Meg.  It's a blast.  :)

Also, the server I use to read my mail is having problems.  If you sent me any
mail either at joe.siegler@apogee1.com, help@apogee1.com, or camera@apogee1.com
in the last couple of days, it's probably lost.  :(

For the time being, send me mail at dopefish@gte.net.   This is probably the last
finger update I'll be doing from 3D Portal as I'm sure you're aware by now that
they're going away.  Thanks to Brad for the .plan access for the last couple of
months.  We're about to go live with our internal mail here at the offices, and
then we'll have plan files here, and it won't be an issue anymore.   Will let
everyone know when that's in place.  Hopefully that happens before 3D Portal
goes away.  :)
