January 24th, 1998

I start off my finger with a bit of sad news.  This is really more for anyone
who worked here in the last couple of years (before 1997, really).

Dennis Scarff, a close associate of mine when he worked here passed away
yesterday, due to a reaction to a flu he contracted about a week ago.  I
feel a loss yesterday, as this guy was a lot of fun.  I'll miss him, and 
my thoughts go out to his wife Harriet.

Also, I caught a remark by Randy Pitchford in his finger about Duke Nukem.
Specifically..

<< Duke I and II didn't have a voice and couldn't really compete
technologically no one cared about the character back then. >>

Well, Duke II *DID* have a voice.  Me.  I was the original voice of Duke
Nukem.  Okay, Okay, he only said two words (in the opening cinematic) - 
"I'm Back", but he did speak.

Couldn't compete technologically?  With what?  3D action games?  What
kind of remark is that?  How do you compare a sidescroller with a 3D
action game?   Also, in regards to "no one caring", as I recall, Duke
Nukem was the #1 shareware game when it was released, beating out things
like PKZip and the like.  Scott Miller can fill in more details there,
as I'm sure he'll remember better than I (I didn't join Apogee until
December of 1992).

Also, I think I'm the only person in this industry who has not seen
Pulp Fiction.  :)
