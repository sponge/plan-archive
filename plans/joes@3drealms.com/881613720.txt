Work:

We've finally gotten ourselves hooked up correctly on the Internet;
our office is now on a T1 behind a firewall.

The firewall is posing us some technical problems; until we get it
all worked out, I don't think anyone from here can access the 
Undernet IRC servers that we usually hang out on, and if you try
to contact us via ICQ, I'm told it's not working fully.

We're working on it; hopefully it will all be resolved soon.

Balls of Steel is close, there's a minor video problem that cropped
up at the last second, or it'd be out by now.  Hang in there, it
should still be out before Xmas if all goes well.

There's a bunch of pictures from 3D Realms' trip this past weekend
to Austin TX to see KMFDM.  Go to our site, and check out the 
News page, there's a link to it in Paul's Prey Update.


Random Personal Thoughts:

1) I might be the only person in this industry that still has not
   seen Pulp Fiction.

2) The original Black Sabbath reunited late last week for two shows.
   There's more on it at my Black Sabbath site at 
 http://www.black-sabbath.com.

3) I happened to notice that I have 14 different Email addresses
   active.  5 are work, and 9 are personal.  Sheesh!

4) The new James Bond movie opens on the 19th.  I'm psyched!  For a 
   damn good James Bond web site (probably the best I've ever seen), go here:
 http://www.mcs.net/~klast/www/bond.html.

5) I'm now a season ticket holder for the Texas Rangers again for the
   second year in a row.

6) There is *NOOOO* thought 6.

7) I saw that Pamela & Tommy Lee tape.  It's *NOT* all it's cracked up to
   be.  From all the hype, you'd expect the be all end all of this kind
   of tape.  It's not.  I have no desire to see it again.

CD's I'm listening to:

Aerosmith - Nine Lives (I like it better now than when it first came out)
Sun Red Sun
Rondinelli - War Dance
