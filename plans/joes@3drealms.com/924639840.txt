Work Stuff (wow, a real .plan update!)  :)

Around the end of this month, the 3D Realms web sites will be moving to new servers.  We hope to make the move without any interruption of service, but just in case there is an unforseen problem, I wanted to alert our fans ahead of time in case something does happen, and there's a disruption.  We will be updating you with news announcements here, as well as in our .plan files, so make sure to keep it here for the latest.

The sites that are affected by this move are:

http://www.3drealms.com (This site) 
http://www.apogee1.com (This site - different URL, same content) 
http://www.maxpayne.com (Official site for Remedy's Max Payne game) 
http://www.dukenukem.com (Our future Duke Nukem site) 
http://www.pinballwizards.com (Site for our Pinball Wizards division) 


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Quiet Riot - Alive & Well (yeah, those guys - new stuff!)
2) Black Sabbath - Reunion (can't help it - when your name is in an album... :)
3) Deep Purple - Abandon
4) George Thorogood - Rockin' my life away
5) Fleetwood Mac - Greatest Hits
