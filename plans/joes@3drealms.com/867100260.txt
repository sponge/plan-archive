Well, everyone is back from E3.  I didn't go, (Waaaah!) so I have no
news to report.

I did see a movie over the weekend, though.  I saw "My Best Friend's
Wedding".  Julia Roberts still looks cool.   The ending wasn't what I
was expecting.  Lot of fun.  The "mush" factor is pretty low, it's a
really funny movie, I thought.  Check it out if you at all like 
Julia Roberts, and if you at all like comedies.  It's pretty cool.

I also heard from three seperate news sources over the weekend that 
after James Cameron is done with "Titanic", he and Arnold are going
to be doing a Terminator 3.  That oughta rock.  I never accepted 
that it was the end of the storyline at the end of T2.  :)

CD's I'm listening to:

Dio - Angry Machines
Black Sabbath - Forbidden
Goldeneye Soundtrack
Def Leppard - Slang

Here's a fact that probably no one will care about.  :)  I got engaged
one year ago today.  What are me and my wife doing?  Going to a Texas
Rangers game tonight.  If you ever have seen the Dallas skyline, you
know that building that has a ball on the top?  That's a restuarant
(among other things) called Antares.  That's where it happened, and
we're going there on Saturday evening.

Anyway, I was poking around the web again, and it appears that someone 
has hacked the Official "Speed 2" movie site over at
(http://www.speed2-cruisecontrol.com).  Unless it's been fixed by the
time you see it, it's simply one line of text.  It says "Overall nice
special effects, but the screen play seems to have been written with
a crayon - Someone who has a clue".  Not to mention the title of the
page was "Speed 2 - Cruise Control - a movie that sinks like the boat
in the movied".  :)  I don't plan on seeing this movie, mainly 
because it looks like crap, but I found this funny anyway.  :)

UPDATE: It's been fixed.  :(

I am planning on seeing Batman & Robin and My Best Friend's Wedding
this month.  The parallels between the Julia Roberts flick and me 
and my wife's own wedding are very VERY similar.

Other Miscelleanous stuff:

- I'm also one of the only people here not going to E3.
- We're working on a new front page "look" for our web site,
  with some help from Brian Cozzens.  Should be online after 
  E3, I'd wager.
- I also found out that my friend Joe Selinske over at Terminal Reality
  will now be working (as producer) with the guys over at
  Hipnotic/Ritual/Whatever-they're-called-this-week Entertainment.
  Joe's been a good friend of mine for the last 4 years, I wish 
  him well there! Hey Joe, I guess the "L" Gesture is not called
  for here, eh? :)
- The Altec Lansing speakers Scott Miller spoke of *DO ROCK*.  I 
  plugged mine in this morning, and boy do they sound great.  Not
  to mention they're very stylish looking.
- I see Paul put Tony Iommi on his list, but he's still not at the
  top.  Come on Paul, you can do better than that!  :)
- I'm still waiting for a response to my request to fix the problem
  with our Live Shot Camera.  I'm having some software problems with
  it.  I didn't make a backup of the old capture software, and now 
  I can only take one picture at a time w/o rebooting the computer.
  Not good when you want to run an auto repeating capture system, eh?

CD's I'm listening to:

Dio - Holy Diver & The Last in Line
Pat Benatar - Inammorata (new stuff - pretty good)
Bobby Prince's Doom Music CD

Book I'm reading:
Doctor Who: Lungbarrow by Marc Platt

June 3rd:

This past Sunday, I went to see OzzFest with Richard Gray from
Hipnotic and another friend of mine Steve Quarrella (Gee, two ex
Apogeers :).  Anyway, this thing totally rocked.  Well, Ozzy &
Black Sabbath did.  The rest of the people blow, so we intentionally
went late.  It totally rocks.  Even without Bill Ward there, it
was awesome.  If you'd care to read my review of the concert, it's
over at my Black Sabbath site at http://www.black-sabbath.com under
Concert Reviews.

CD's I'm listening to:

Since I saw the band of the Gods on Sunday, I'm listening to nothing
other than Black Sabbath at the moment.  "Black Sabbath", Paranoid,
Master of Reality, Sabotage..    Ahhhh... Musical Ecstasy.

One other thing.  If you play audio CD's and have a Windows95 or
WindowsNT machine, you should be using a program by Matt Jensen
called DiscPlay.  This thing is so awesome, it's not funny.  
**AND** the registration is only $15.  Check it out.  You won't
regret it.  Uses the internet CDDB Database.  That's one of those
cool uses of the Internet that the mass media doesn't want to cover
(it's not as interesting as reporting on kiddie porn).

I've gotten a few E-Mails lately asking why I personally
haven't done any more levels for our games since i did about
20 or so for Rise of the Triad.  I wanted to say that I'm
pleased that some people out there care.  That was my first
game where I really had published work, and I'm sure as most
everyone in this industry can say, it's nice when your first
work gets noticed.  Why no more levels?  Ever try making a
ROTT level?  You can crank out a decent ROTT level in a day.
Build Levels take MUCH MUCH longer.  Sure, anyone can shab
together a Build level in a day, but if you want it to be
good, it's got to take longer than that.  I might take a 
crack at the Preditor and see what I can do though.  I do
miss level design, though.

Heard on the radio today that Howard Stern might not be on 
the air anymore in Dallas come August.  His contract is up,
and apparently the people who own KEGL don't want to renew
his contract.  That would really suck!  I've been listening
to Howard on and off for about 10 years now, since he first
hit Philly.

Metal CD's I'm listening to this week:

WASP - KFD (Still - It rocks)
Black Sabbath - Never Say Die
Deep Purple - The Battle Rages On

May 19th:

I've decided I'm not going to write about the same old stuff that you
see on all these other fingers, mine's gonna be non work related
usually. :)

BTW, I saw George go "Waaah" over getting 200 pieces of E-mail. Pffft. 
I can do that asleep. I get over 1,000 a day. :)

Anyone else out there have a USRobotics Pilot? When Tom Hall (of Ion
Storm) was at my wedding (Yeah! Tom was in my wedding), he showed me 
his Pilot, and I was hooked. I love the thing! Also, Paul Schuytema and 
Tom Pytel of 3D Realms also have 'em, and I was wondering who else in 
this industry has 'em.

Metal CD's to check out:

Queensryche - Hear in the Now Frontier
Black Sabbath - The Sabbath Stones (Import in US)
