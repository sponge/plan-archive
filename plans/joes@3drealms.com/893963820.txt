Work Stuff:

1) On Monday, I completed sending out the second issue of our Email Newsletter.  If you'd like to get a copy of it, visit our web page, there's a link to the signup page right up front.

2) Downloaded and played Descent: Freespace today.  Fun game.  Descent confused me, but for some reason, being in space seems to help this (at least with my perception) problem I had.

3) No, I don't have plans to hook our Coke Machine up to our web site (someone asked).


Fun Links:

Here's some fun links I found lately.

1) http://www.eonline.com/Fun/Quiz/Simpsons/index.html?fd.thirds.bl
   A fun link over at E which is a Simpsons Quiz.

2) http://corona.bc.ca/films/homepage.html
   Coming Attractions - An excellent site with info on under production movies.

3) http://us.imdb.com/Title?Duke+Nukem%3A+The+Movie+(1999)
   The Internet Movie Database's Duke Nukem Movie Page - Nothing there, but the page exists.  Speaking of that, I noticed the movie site I mentioned above has a slot for a Duke Nukem movie, but they haven't created the page yet.

4) http://www.usps.gov/ncsc/lookups/lookup_zip+4.html
   The Post Office's Zip+4 Lookup site.  I send letters to our customers when they win stuff, and this helps a lot.  


CD's I'm listening to:

Iron Maiden - Virtual XI (it's quite good, unless you're one of these people that are stuck in the past with their musical perceptions)
Rush - Test for Echo (same remark as the Iron Maiden album)
Black Sabbath - Tyr
Pink Floyd - Animals


Silly Email:

There was a feature that 3D Portal had started, and they seem to have abandoned (called Lamer Bin).  I thought it was a funny idea, actually (hint, hint guys).  It was where they posted stupid Email that they get.  I answer mail for us, and I have QUITE a pile of Email.  I think I'm gonna bring that feature back.  Of course I'm gonna mask who it comes from, but here goes:

From: Withheld
To: 
Subject: Guided Tour
Date sent: Wed, 13 Aug 1997 11:57:35 -0700

I noticed that in my tour I either did not see a womens urinal or if that was the womens urinal that seat must be terribly uncomfortable.Is this a blatant act of Bias or do the women actually enjoy this bathroom .If I was the women I would get on the lawsuit wagon and charge minority discrimination. Thank you guys for being a great bunch of designers and good luck on this horrible travesty of justice (maybe due should pay a visit to these people)
