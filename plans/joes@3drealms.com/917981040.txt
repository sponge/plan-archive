Work Stuff:

1) There's a problem with the server over at 3D Portal; this is preventing our web forums from working today.  Should be cleared up today.

2) Got this in email from my father who works for DEC...  "Trust the computer industry to shorten 'Year 2000 Problem' to Y2K.  That's exactly the kind of thinking that caused the problem in the first place!"


Non Work Stuff:

1) Woo-hoo!  :)  Got my copy of Sim City 3000 today.  Been waiting for this for quite some time.  If anyone knows of any decent fan sites for this game, drop me a line.

2) Did anyone happen to catch the Rear Window remake about two months ago with Christopher Reeve?  If so, please drop me a line.
