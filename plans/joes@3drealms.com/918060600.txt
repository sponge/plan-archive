Does anyone use the Deluxe CD Player that comes with Windows98's Plus Pack?  I have a question about it.  Some time ago, I remember reading of a feature where you could take your entire database collection, and publish it on a web page.  I went looking for info on that the other day on Microsoft's site, and couldn't find it.

If you know anything about this, please drop me a line.  Danke.

Joe

P.S-> The 3D Portal server problem from yesterday has been cleared up.

Work Stuff:

1) There's a problem with the server over at 3D Portal; this is preventing our web forums from working today.  Should be cleared up today.

2) Got this in email from my father who works for DEC...  "Trust the computer industry to shorten 'Year 2000 Problem' to Y2K.  That's exactly the kind of thinking that caused the problem in the first place!"


Non Work Stuff:

1) Woo-hoo!  :)  Got my copy of Sim City 3000 today.  Been waiting for this for quite some time.  If anyone knows of any decent fan sites for this game, drop me a line.

2) Did anyone happen to catch the Rear Window remake about two months ago with Christopher Reeve?  If so, please drop me a line.
