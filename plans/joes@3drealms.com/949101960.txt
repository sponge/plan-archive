Work Stuff:

1) Had a minor setback yesterday with the web site. Apparantly, a couple of repeating graphics used in the new design were causing a huge CPU hit on Internet Explorer (but not Netscape; it's usually the other way around - go figure). Anyway, yesterday was spent fixing this problem. This has put me about two days behind my original target for data conversion (not launch of site), which was supposed to be today. We'll see where we stand come Tuesday. It's all coming together rather nicely.

2) Tomorrow (Saturday the 29th) is Duke Nukem 3D's fourth anniversary. Duke Nukem 3D shareware v1.0 was released on Jan 29th, 1996. Not sure if we have anything planned at this point - but if you want to check out some old stuff for Duke's annivesary, check out LameDuke, which we released on the first anniversary of Duke Nukem 3D back in 1997. You can get that here: http://www.3drealms.com/catalog/duke3d/lameduke.html 


Non Work Stuff:

1) Noticed today that Amazon is now taking pre-orders for Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace on VHS (no DVD is planned from Lucas until all 6 SW movies are out). Anyway, if you're intersted, here's a few links for ya:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/630575067X/73407921 

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305750750/73407921 

The first one is the standard version of the movie (which is full screen). The second one is the widescreen "box set", which also includes (according to Amazon) a behind the scenes documentary, a book on movie art, and a mounted filmstrip (OOOoooohhh - hold me back).

Personally, I'd prefer a DVD, but if you want to buy the VHS tapes, you can do so via the links above.
