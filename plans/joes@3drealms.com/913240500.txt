1) Anyone out there playing Brunswick Pro Circuit Bowling?  If so, drop me a line.

3) The totally awesome Amazon.com DVD sale has changed slightly now.  It was the Top 100 DVD's for 50% off, but now it's just Top 10 DVD's for 50% off - Numbers 11-100 are still 30% off, which seems to be the going discount rate for DVD's around the web.  Head over to Amazon and check out their Top DVD sale.  It's way cool.


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Cozy Powell - Especially for You
2) The Simpsons - The Yellow Album
3) Metallica - Garage, Inc.
4) Queen's Greatest Hits I & II
