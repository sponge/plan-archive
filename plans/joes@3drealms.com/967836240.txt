Is there anyone reading this that would know anything about the old RSAC game ratings system?  That's the ratings system that was used by several people (including us) before the one being used now. 

The reason I'm asking is because I'm looking for the graphics that made up the various RSAC rating levels.  No one here has them anymore, and I contacted the company that took over the old RSAC stuff, and they claim that no one there has them anymore either.

If you happen to know where they are, or where I could obtain them, please drop me a line.  I've asked a few people who I used to work with before, contacted a few companies we used to work with, all with no luck.   Can you help?  :)

Non-Work Stuff:

I'm going to see the Iron Maiden / Queensryche concert tonight in Dallas.  Boy, did I pick a night for an outdoor concert - it's supposd to be 108 today!  BLECH.  :(
