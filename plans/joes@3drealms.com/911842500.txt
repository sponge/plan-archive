2) Anyone out there a Texas Ranger or Philadelphia Phillies fan (especially a season ticket holder)?  Drop me a line.

3) 35 years ago today, the first episode of Doctor Who aired on the BBC around 5:25PM (UK Time - I'm fairly sure that's the correct time).  Doctor Who was actually the first thing they aired after coverage of the Kennedy assassination.


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Tom Petty - Greatest Hits
2) The Kinks - Greatest Hits
3) Van Halen - Best of Vol 1
4) Van Halen III
5) Black Sabbath - Reunion


Finally, if you don't like what I write about in my .plan file, don't read it.  It's as simple as that.  No one is putting a gun to your head making you read what I write.  :D
