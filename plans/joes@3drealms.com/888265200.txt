Web Stuff:

1) There was a problem on Sunday afternoon with our web site.  A CGI process
   jammed, taking down the ability to post anything to our message bases.  
   The problem should be resolved around 5-6AMish on Tuesday Morning (hopefully).

2) Due to the problem above, I can't use FrontPage to edit the site, so I have
   put up just the new news updates for the day.  The rest of the updates (things
   like the new entries for the Banner contest) will go up on Tuesday (assuming
   the problem gets fixed).

3) There's a lot of good entries coming in for the contest.  I'm probably going
   to change the rules around the end of the week, because people are sending in
   300-600k GIF animations.  While they look cool, it's a totally unrealistic size
   for a banner.  I like them, but no one will use them, because they're too big.
   Try and keep things under 200k for animations (which is still extremely large).


WTF Department:

1) Here's something that pisses me off.  The term "El Nino".  I mean, what is this
   for?  Our soceity is so bored with things from the past that they can't call
   this what it really is.   RAIN.   That's all this term really means.  It was 
   called "RAIN" all these years up until very recently.  Why now do rainstorms have
   to be called "El Nino"?

2) "Unknown Device" when doing a Plug 'n' Pray scan in Windows95.  I just love the
   dialog box that Win95 comes up with "Win95 has detected an unknown device, and
   is installing the software for that device".  ??!?!?!?!


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Pink Floyd - The Final Cut (again)
2) Rainbow - Stranger in Us All
3) Genesis - Calling All Stations
4) Pat Boone - In A Metal Mood
