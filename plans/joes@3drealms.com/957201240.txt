To anyone who has seen the Bill Clinton mockumentary video that was released yesterday..  Anyone know if there's a good HIGH QUALITY version of it available for DL on the net?  I've only been able to find crappy 28k or 80k streaming Real Media versions.

I was looking for some huge high quality version of the thing.  If so, let me know, but PLEASE do not email the thing to me.  :)

Thanks.
