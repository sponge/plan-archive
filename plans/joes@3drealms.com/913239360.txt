1) I just got off the phone with Lee Jackson.  He is in the Hospital.

He just told me that it's official, he's having his gallbladder removed.  He says that his doctor told him that he's undergoing surgery within the next 12 to 24 hours, and he'll keep me updated as to what's going on with his recovery. If I find out anything further, I'll pass it along.  It's not life threatening, but still, surgery is never a good thing. :(

I set up a topic on our site's Msg bases about this - if you want to check it out, go here:

2) Anyone out there playing Brunswick Pro Circuit Bowling?  If so, drop me a line.

3) The totally awesome Amazon.com DVD sale has changed slightly now.  It was the Top 100 DVD's for 50% off, but now it's just Top 10 DVD's for 50% off - Numbers 11-100 are still 30% off, which seems to be the going discount rate for DVD's around the web.  Head over to Amazon and check out their Top DVD sale.  It's way cool.


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Cozy Powell - Especially for You
2) The Simpsons - The Yellow Album
3) Metallica - Garage, Inc.
4) Queen's Greatest Hits I & II
