Work Stuff:

1) Go check out our (not officially released) poll script at http://www.3drealms.com/poll.html.  There's a question about the poll script itself there I'd like some folks to answer.


Other Stuff:

1) The woman who played Lt. Ilia (Persis Khambatta) in the first Star Trek movie died last week of a heart attack - she was 49.  :(

2) Speaking of Star Trek, the trailer for the next movie, "Star Trek: Insurrection" is making the rounds now.  It was on Entertainment Tonight last week, and it's on a few web sites that have this "advance" info on Trek movies.  Check it out.  This looks to easily be the best Next Gen movie, possibly the best Star Trek movie of all.

4) Wall of Sound has a poll online where you can vote for your fav albums of the 80's.  It's pretty cool, actually.  http://www.wallofsound.com/.

5) There's a cute poll over on abcnews.com about whether or not you're a net addict.  Go take the poll at http://www.abcnews.com/sections/tech/DailyNews/netaddictsurvey_intro980810.html.

CD's I'm listening to:

0) None.
