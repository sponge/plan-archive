1) Thanks to everyone (all 250 or so of you) who replied to my Shawshank Redemption question from yesterday's plan file.  Of all the people that emailed me, only one gave me a really good idea.  Go to the library and get the book.  Thanks Doug Howell, I'll do that.  A better idea than just buying the book just to read a short story.  :)

2) Found a site that has still pictures from the forthcoming Star Wars Trailer online.  Due to the popularity of the subject matter, the site is clogged - Duh!   But if you can get through to check it out, it's worth it..

Stuff:

1) I just updated the Dopefish site with some pictures of a guy who dressed up as Dopefish for Halloween.  They're pretty damn funny - go check it out at http://www.dopefish.com.

2) Does anyone know where you can get the Stephen King short story "Rita Hayworth & the Shawshank Redemption"?  My wife and I love the movie, and I'd be curious to read his original short story.

3) Does anyone have the Flash Gordon (1980) DVD?  If so, drop me a line, please.  Was wondering if there was any kind of extra stuff on this.

CD's I'm listening to:

1) Queen - Greatest Hits
2) Brian May - Another World (it's kinda a Brian May Day :)
3) Tom Petty - Greatest Hits
4) The Simpsons - Songs in the Key of Springfield
