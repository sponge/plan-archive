I don't often make comments like this in my plan file, I'm usually pretty laid back about things like this, but I decided to post my feelings on a few things.


"Top 10 List of things we could do without in the game industry".

 1) Top 10 Lists.

 2) Another friggin joystick from some company.  These things blow for 3D action games, which is the dominant game format now anyway.  

 3) Another mouse from Logitech.

 4) Game demos about 3/4 months before the release of the full game.  Does anyone care about the full game by then?

 5) "Jerry Springer" game news web sites who try to shock people, and then go legit.  If you wanted to be "legit" news, why not just do that in the first place?

 6) More Quake.

 7) The DOJ telling us how to run our computer companies.

 8) More TC's from people obviously incapable of doing one that anyone would really care about anyway (how about about a few REALLY good ones instead of a million crappy ones?)

 9) Yet another startup game company made from ex employees of another.  How about some really TRUE new blood?

10) Web Gaming Site polls asking what your most looked forward to game is.
 

CD's I'm listening to:

1) Black Sabbath - Reunion
2) Phil Colins - Hits
3) Fleetwood Mac - The Dance
4) Joe Satriani - The Extremist
