Web Site:
---------
Well, our "Apogee 98" Web site is now online.  Check it out at http://www.apogee1.com
(or http://www.3drealms.com, too).   It rocks.  That's all I'll say about it.  If
you have some feedback on it, please let me know.


Balls of Steel:
---------------
The v1.1 CD Master is in duplication, should be moving to store shelves soon, and we
will finally be getting our in house copies so we can ship direct orders, too.  Now
that the Apogee98 site is online, I will get to work on the v1.1 shareware episode,
and the patches for the existing v1.0's that are out there.  I'm hoping that will
all get done on Monday.

Personal:
---------
I love my wife.  If you scoff at me saying this here, deal with it.  I do.  I don't care
who knows.

The Taking of Pelham 123 remake was OK.  It didn't totally suck, but it wasn't great,
either.
