James Bond: I've been saying for over a decade that John Cleese would make a perfect replacement for Q if he ever quit.  Well, as you may know, Cleese is in the new 007 flick as "R", Q's assistant.   Read today that he also signed on for three more 007 flicks in the same role!   Oh man, this is awesome!!

Work Stuff:

1) Work is progressing on the new site.  Started working on moving over some of the old content.  This is going to be so much cooler than our current site!!   

Because of this, updates to the current site will be minimal.

Non-Work Stuff:

1) Does anyone have the Hasbro Chess via Email game?  If so, and you're interested in playing, please drop me a line.  Thanks.   If you don't know what this is, go check out http://www.emailgames.com.  It's pretty cool - they have games you play via someone else, and your moves are sent through email.

2) Caught on the Official Star Wars site today that Jar-Jar Binks will be back in Episode II.  Check out this text at http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/news/index.html#ahmed:

November 10, 1999 -- While George Lucas is still working on the script for the next film, and the start of general casting is still several months away, several actors are already clearing their schedules to be available for filming in Australia and on location next summer. Among them, we're happy to confirm, is Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, who will be rejoining Ewan McGregor (playing Obi-Wan Kenobi) and Natalie Portman (as Queen Amidala) for Star Wars: Episode II. 

CD's I'm listening to:

1) Queensryche - Q2K
2) Megadeth - Risk
3) Van Halen 3
4) Geezer - Black Science
5) Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince - Greatest Hits
