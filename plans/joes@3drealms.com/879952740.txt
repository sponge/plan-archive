Work:

Balls of Steel is final.  I've been given "final code", and
today, I'm shipping off a CD to GT for final QA testing.  Assuming
it passes that, then it's off to mass duplication, and then we
put together and release the shareware episode.  There's still
a decent chance it will be out before Thanksgiving.

However, as usual, remember to check out the "When it's done"
sign hanging on the wall.  :)

Loved Paul Jaquays's plan update the other day talking about why
level designers don't do work updates in their files.  :)  Got a
major laugh out of it.  You could extend that to people who do
things like print manuals and the like.  Or Bob the Janitor (laugh)!

Personal:
---------
As some of you know, I do the web sites for black-sabbath.com, and
for Bill Ward (original Sabbath drummer - billward.com).  I was 
contacted this week by another former member of Sabbath about doing
a site for him. When we work out the details, I'll let you know who
he is (he's not on this list below).

A bit of ego tripping:  Since I've started doing that Black Sabbath
site, I've had several people who used to be in the group get in
touch with me for one reason or another.  I've had contact with Bill
Ward, Cozy Powell, Vinny Appice, Neil Murray, Dave Spitz, Bob Daisley,
& Tony Martin.  As a fan of the group, it's bizarre that the people
I've been listening to for years have emailed me, or called me on the
phone.  (Coming off cloud now)

CD's I'm listening to:
----------------------
Black Sabbath - Tyr
Aerosmith - Nine Lives (was disappointed with this, actually)
Dio - Dream Evil
Judas Priest - Jugulator
Ozzy Osbourne - The Ozzman Cometh
Brian May - Back to the Light
Yes - Union (I saw this live, it was awesome!)
Stevie Ray Vaughn - Greatest Hits
Rainbow - Rising (One of my "Desert island" albums)
