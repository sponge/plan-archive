Work Stuff:

1) A few days ago, someone emailed me about the "typewriter text" application that used to run on the front page of our web site.  I managed to locate the archive (with the help of an old friend of mine), but I lost your email address.  If that's you, you can download the thing here: http://www.3drealms.com/stuff/typewriter.tar.   Also, the person who wrote it has a newer version, if you want to look at that, its here: http://www.ericharshbarger.com/eric-cgi/j?type/index.html.   

2) There was a problem where our office internet system locked up on Friday, and didn't get cleared up until sometime on Sunday (I think).  Anyways, if you tried to send mail or something of that nature to someone here, and it didn't get through, try again - all should be well now.
