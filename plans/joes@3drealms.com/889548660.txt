Stuff:

1) Released an old game of ours today as freeware.  "Beyond the Titanic".  It's an old text adventure game by Scott Miller.  We're not offering any support or taking registrations, but we thought that this was an "appropriate" time for it to be released again.  :)

2) I've started taking some pictures for the updated Virtual Tour.  Still not totally sure what format it's gonna take, but I'm hoping to have it done by the end of the month (but no guarantees).

3) Noticed the search page on our web site isn't finding anything.  I'm looking into it.

4) The Live Cam is still down, because I can't get the camera working again due to the big storm a week ago.  I'm gonna have to take it in to get fixed.  :(

5) Is there anyone out there who is using MicroSoft Publisher 98?  If so, please Email me, I've got a question or two for you (especially if you're from MicroSoft).

6) There's a real funny article over on CNN about Monty Python and their reunion next year for their 30th anniversary.  Check it out at http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9803/09/britain.python.reut/.  I really like the way they figured out to involve Graham Chapman, who died in 1989.

7) Also, there's a review of the new "PalmIII" (aka PalmPilot revision 3) at http://www.tapped.com/palmiii.htm.  If you use a Pilot, you should read this.

8) http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~bct7m/star_links.html -- That is one of the coolest sites I've gone to in awhile.  You plug in two names of any actors, and it will link them (kinda like the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon thing).  Check this out, it's a blast.  I've sat there for like two hours some sleepless nights plugging in names.  Longest I've gotten it to go is 5 links.

CD's I'm listening to:

1) Joe Satriani - Crystal Planet (his new one - it's damn good)
2) The Simpsons - Songs in the Key of Springfield
3) Judas Priest - Jugulator
4) Iron Maiden - Best of the Beast
