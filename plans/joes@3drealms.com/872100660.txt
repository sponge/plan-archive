Work Stuff:
-----------

1) Dave Taylor ->  Yeesh.  :)

2) Shadow Warrior -> I've geen given what could be "final code" for
   the registered CD's.  I've assembled the goodies directory, gotten
   the shareware together, worked on the installation program, got
   updated TEN code, etc..  In other words, the game is done.  Once I
   get the final green light, I'll be burning the master CD that all
   the millions of CD's will get copied from.  Shadow Warrior has been
   under development for some time now, it'll be good to be done with
   it.  I found a memo from December 1993 showing all the games we had
   under development then, and Shadow Warrior was on there with it's
   orginal name (it was called "Ninja Master" then).

   Counting all the audio tracks & the computer data, this CD is very
   close to being full.  It's about 630Megs of stuff on it, and
   there's no 90mb .avi files to help fill it up, either.  :)

3) Balls of Steel -> This is close behind.  I've done some work on the
   help file for that, as BOS is a Win95 native game, and my old style
   of help file won't cut it anymore.  :)   Can't wait to get this
   game out there, it's a *TON* of fun, especially the fact that you
   can do high scores over the Internet against the rest of the world.
   It's a blast!

4) Prey -> I spoke with Paul Schuytema about doing some level design
   for Prey.  I'm going to take a stab at a level or two, and if
   they're good enough, I hope to have them in the game.  Please don't
   take this that I'm on the Prey team full time or anything like
   that.  I don't want to step on the feet of the existing designers.
   This is more of me doing it on a lark, and if something good comes
   out of it, then hey, that's cool.  I don't really want to see my
   name turn up on the Prey pages.   The only reason I mention it at
   all is that since I mentioned in here about my ROTT level design
   experience, I've gotten some E-Mails asking if I was going to do
   level design again.  I'm gonna try.  :)

   Hmm..  The Vomitorium in portal technology.  :)


Personal Stuff:
---------------

1) Today is my 32nd birthday.

2) The Billy Joel CD I mention below was released yesterday.  My wife
   Lynn got it for me for a birthday present.  For those Billy Joel
   fans out there, there are three new tracks on here, but they are
   *ALL* cover tunes.  No new Joel tunes. Speaking of that, I heard a
   rumour that this is the final Billy Joel album.  Something about
   him not wanting to do this type of music anymore.  Can anyone
   confirm that?

3) It's about time Roger Waters puts out something new!

4) George was deposed on our Pinball Table.  Ha!  :)

CD's I'm listening to:

1) Billy Joel - Greatest Hits Volume 3
2) Van Halen - Balance
3) Iron Maiden - Best of the Beast
4) Bill Ward - When the Bough Breaks


Stupid User E-Mail:
-------------------

I was looking through my collection of (ahem) some of the more 
verbally eloquent E-Mails that I get, and found this little gem. 
Can't even figure the thing out, I don't think it's in English.

Personal Stuff:

I got asked about this, and quite frankly, I had forgotten about
it.  If anyone reads Star Trek books, and happens to have a copy
of a book published in 1990 called "Doctor's Orders", get it out.

In this book, if you turn to Page 67, you'll see Dr. McCoy 
talking to a medical grunt you'll recognize. :)  There's a one
"Lt. Joe Siegler" mentioned there.  Yes, that's me, and no it is
not a coincidence.  Back in 1989/1990, I hung out a lot on the
CompuServe Science Fiction Forums, and from that led to an E-mail
exchange between me and the author of this book, Diane Duane.

Diane and I got to talking once, and I jokingly said "Hey, put
me in one of your books, but if you do, kill me".  I seem to 
remember only joking about it, but she did it!  A few pages later,
I get eaten by a tree (if you read the book, it makes sense).

I'm not making this up.  Go to a book store, and look at the
book "Doctor's Orders" by Diane Duane, and look at Page 67.  :)

Diane, if you happen to read this (I doubt it, but hey), can you
please E-Mail me?  Thanks.

Work Stuff:

I've been burning CD's fast and furious for our people here, as well
as for GT for testing.  Looks like Shadow Warrior is close, because
I've been instructed to work on the tech file for it.  :)   My new
shiny CD burner rocks.  I can burn a full CD of 650 or so megs in
10 minutes.  Much nicer than the old one I had which took almost
two HOURS to burn the same size CD.

CD's I'm listening to:

For those of you who have been following this, you're gonna think I've
gone off the deep end here, but these are the CD's I'm listening to
today (mainly due to the last one on this list) :)

Twisted Sister - Big Hits & Nasty Cuts
The Best of the Kinks
Doctor Who 1996 Movie Soundtrack
The Best of the Village People

More good feedback has been rolling in for the new look web site.

Some people have decided however that it's so good that they're
going to use it for their own sites!  I'm not just talking about
the general idea, I'm talking about the whole thing, lock stock
and barrel.

Stealing all the graphics, the idea, the code, man, EVERYTHING.
This is really friggin annoying.  Brian & I spent a hell of a
lot of time working on this, and I realize that the Internet is
a place where theft happens all the time, but cripes folks! 
Are you that derift of skill and ideas that you have to rip off
our entire site to make one of your own?  If that's the case, 
then you shouldn't be doing a web site at all.

This has been brought to my attention twice now, and in both
instances it has pissed me off.  The one that I was told about
this morning was even worse, because the kid's update list even
said something to the effect of that they wanted a new look to
their site, so a new one was created (don't you mean stolen)?

There's a lot of good on the net out there, but people like this
who steal the site altogether and then claim it was theirs really
pisses me off.

Get a clue, people.  Do you own thing and don't steal the hard 
work of others out there, eh?

CD's I'm listening to:
Iron Maiden - The Best of the Beast
Geezer - Black Science (Man, this RULES!)
Motley Crue - Generation Swine
Twisted Sister - Big Hits, Nasty Cuts
Bill Ward - Ward One: Along the Way

Man, writing this has pissed me off again about this subject. 
The person this morning has an ICQ pager.  Perhaps I should put
his URL on here, and have everyone flood him with requests to 
remove the graphics.  :)

Speaking of people that cheese you off, I got this E-mail a few
days ago.  I can't possibly people people can really be this stupid.
But they can.  Read this:

George Carlin said this a long time ago.  And it still holds true.
Man does it EVER hold true.

 are STUPIDER THAN THAT!"

Web Stuff:

A lot of good feedback on the new web layout.  I haven't seen a
single bad message about it.  We new it was good, but quite frankly,
I'm surprised NO ONE said anything bad about it.  Hell, I've even
gotten a few messages from some of my friends in the industry saying
they wish their sites looked like that.  :)

Movie Stuff:

I saw a movie I think I might be the only person in the industry to
go see.  HERCULES.  Yes, *THAT* Hercules.  I actually enjoyed it.
I'm truly beginning to believe that I'm not the same as everyone else
in the industry.  I go see Disney movies in the theatres.  :)

Cool Stuff:

We got a pinball machine in the office today.  A real machine, it's
called...  Oh crap, I can't remember the name of it right now, but
it's got the word "Stiff" in the title, and it is Elvira themed.
(Yeah I know I could walk over there and find out what it is, but 
hey, this is the gaming industry, aren't we supposed to be lazy? :)

Speaking of the pinball machine, I currently rock over everyone else
who has played it.  I'm the only one to place on the machine's high
score list.  Pfffft to everyone else.   I've also got the highest
scores of anyone internally at Apogee on Balls of Steel, too.  :)

Balls of Steel:

That reminds me.  There's a really cool feature I like in Balls of 
Steel, where it will coordinate high scores around the world from
people who play the game (so long as they have a TCP/IP connection).
It's really cool, and you'll be able to see how you rank against
other players (including us) around the globe.  I can't wait for this
to come out and play with some of y'all.

Personal Stuff:

Got a washer and dryer yesterday.  Exciting stuff, eh?  It is for me.
For the first time since I moved to Texas to take the job with Apogee
(which was November of 1992), I don't have to plunk quarters into the
stupid white boxes that clean my clothes.  Yaay!   Now they can go for
other things, like buying more CD's.  :)
