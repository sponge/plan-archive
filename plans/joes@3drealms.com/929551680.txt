Work Stuff:

1) Testing 1-2-3.

Non Work Stuff:

1) Ding Dong, the Wicked Witch is dead!  Yay!!  Circuit City pulled the plug on DIVX.  That reminds me of the scene from Monty Python's Holy Grail...  "...and there was much rejoicing!!"

2) And you thought the end of Phantom Menace was the end of Jar-Jar Binks?  Think again.  He's gonna be back in Episode II, per an interview with George Lucas.  If you watched the special on Fox about the special effects in Star Wars, Lucas said that Jar Jar will "probably" return in the next one.

Let the flames begin.  :)
