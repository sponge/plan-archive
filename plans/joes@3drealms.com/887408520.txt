Misc Stuff:

0) 28 years ago today, Black Sabbath released their first album!  Awesome!  :)

1) I was looking for a program the other day that will change my windows wallpaper for me
   automatically.  I found a million of them.  But, I'd like one that would look for the
   image files inside a zip file.  None that I found did that.  Does anyone know of any
   like that?  If so, please let me know.

2) Also (and this is gonna sound really REALLY geeky), but is there anyone out there who
   likes the old TV show Alf?  My wife and I love that, and if you happen to have the
   show on tape, send me an Email.

3) Regarding Keith Schuler's "Monkey" finger update.  Go to his bio page on our web site,
   and click on his nose.  :)
