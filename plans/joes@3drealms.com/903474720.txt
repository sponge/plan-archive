Work Stuff:


1) I'm going to be putting out a new issue of our email newsletter tomorrow.  Don't know why I'm mentioning it in my plan file, but since I'm here...

2) There's an interview with me over at The Apogee Temple.  Check it out...  http://www.3dportal.com/apogeetemple/.



Other Stuff:

0) It's my birthday on Thursday.  Number 33.  Robert Plant has the same birthday as me.

1) Is there anyone who plays Hardball 6?  If so, please Email me.

2) I actually watched an episode of South Park that I liked.  Normally I hate this show, but for some reason this one made me laugh (the one with the giant Snake Firework)


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Madonna - Ray of Light (One of my fav albums of the year)
2) Geezer - Black Science (One of my other favs of the year)
