Work Stuff:

I released Balls of Steel about 30 minutes ago (it's 11:30AM as I write this).
There's a list of download places at http://www.pinballwizards.com/download.html.
Go check it out.  It rocks.

Couple of short comments about it.  It's our first Windows game in the slightly
over 10 years history of the company.  Up until now, everything has been DOS.
The retail version should be in the stores next week, from the 16th to the 19th
depending on where you are or what your local store has ordered.  :)

Also, T1's rock.  I see that Scott Miller said that it took us (me, really) 3.5
minutes to upload the file to our server.  Let me correct him.  It took me
precisely 3 minutes and 1 second to upload the 13,888,512 byte file to the 
server.  Was beautiful watching it fly that fast.   I wish I had this kind of speed
when I would take two full days uploading our games to all the BBS's around the
country like Software Creations, Exec-PC, Execnet, etc....  And I remember us
saying that 1Mb was too large, so we made a smaller version so people would download
it (speaking of Monster Bash).  ;)

Now that Balls of Steel is out, the next new game from 3D Realms (as all other games
under development now are in the 3DR banner) is Descent: FreeSpace.  See Scott 
Miller's plan file for more on that.

Personal Stuff:

Sunday is my 5 year anniversary working for Apogee.  I started here December 14, 1992.
Major Stryker was the first new game released when I was on the payroll.  :)

If anyone watches Deep Space Nine/Voyager, you should remember the really damn cool
story arc they did at the beginning of the DS9 season.  It was awesome.  They're doing
the same type of thing for Voyager in a few weeks.  Supposed to be cool, as they 
find a way to..  No, I won't spoil it.  It's way cool, though.

Anyone who follows me (all 4 of you) knows that I do the web site for Black Sabbath
(although unofficially).  I do, however officially do a site for Bill Ward, the 
original Black Sabbath drummer.  Two days ago, I struck a deal with Cozy Powell,
whom some of you might know from Rainbow/Whitesnake/Black Sabbath/ELP/Etc...  I'm
going to be doing his web site, too.  :)

It's way cool when your musical idols call you on the telephone.  (laugh)

CD's I'm listening to:

Brian Setzer - Guitar Slinger
Judas Priest - Jugulator
Rainbow - Rising
Rainbow - Long Live Rock 'n' Roll
