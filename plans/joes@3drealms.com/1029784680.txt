Well, I have a bit of sad news to report, so I'll just get right to it.  Former Apogee/3D Realms programmer William Scarboro has died.  He died of an asthma attack on Friday August 9th, and his funeral was today.

William was born March 2, 1971 in El Paso, TX.  He was a graduate of Texas A&M with a degree in Computer Science.  He came to work here back in 1993, and was the first programmer we hired back then when we started doing in house development.  He was mainly known for his work on Rise of the Triad where he worked on actor code, weapon stuff, and the gibs.  In fact, William was responsible for the old /EKG gib cheat in ROTT.

For me personally, it sucks because William was a good friend.  He hasn't worked here in many years, and he was someone I still kept in touch with semi regularly after he left.  He was someone who shared my views on music, and entertainment - and was the kind of person who could set off both of us laughing just by looking at each other - didn't have to say anything.

His obituary was in the Dallas Morning News Website in the following URL - the date listed there as his date of death was wrong, but otherwise is correct.

Sad news - and definitely put a damper on all of my thoughts now.  :( 

I'll finish with something that the two of us used to share a lot of laughs over.  "Uh... 27" - See ya later "Da Hur".
