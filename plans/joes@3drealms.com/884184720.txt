Our Email/Finger Stuff:

Hey gang, I'm back with a finger.   As you've probably noticed by
now, our crew is now "fingerless".  We're in the final stages of
getting finger stuff set up in house.  At that point, the plan is
for everyone here will have their own finger and email access.  
Email for us here is still working, so if you had an address before,
then it's still working.

To this, yesterday we discovered a DNS problem with our mail
server, so if you sent mail to someone @apogee1.com or @3drealms.com,
and didn't get an answer, try sending again, the mail may have been
sent into the nether regions of the Internet.  That should be
straightened out now.

Repeating.  All of us are now "fingerless" (save for myself here). 
We didn't think it was worth the bother to set up everyone with an
external finger when we're "this close" to getting it working inhouse.

Misc Stuff:

As some of you may have seen before over on Preystation, there's some
very silly links in my bookmark file.   Go check out Preystation, and
there's a link to my bookmark file.

Also, I recently bought myself a programme guide for the Simpsons.  Man,
this thing is awesome!  It covers all the seasons (except for the current
one), including all the old Tracy Ullman shorts.  If you like the Simpsons,
I *STRONGLY* urge you to buy this book.  It has lists of all the D'ohs, 
the couch gags, the blackboard remarks, tidbits, voice lists, and it
doesn't end!  This rocks hard (if you like the Simpsons, that is).  
Here's a link to buy the book from Amazon.com (who also rock hard).

There's a new Star Trek: Voyager on next Wednesday.  Also, if you're
familiar with Deep Space 9, you'll know they started this current season
with a 6 story story arc, which was never done before in 30 years of
Trek.  Voyager is doing something similar starting in the episode after
this one.  It's a really cool story arc starting with the episode entitled
"Message in a Bottle".  Can't wait.

Titanic.  Go see it.  It rocks hard.  I thought I would be bored, but I
wasn't.  I loved it.  It's awesome.   So is the new Bond movie, although
you'll get a different opinion out of that from the other people here.
My opinion of TND..  If you liked Goldeneye, you'll like this one, too.
