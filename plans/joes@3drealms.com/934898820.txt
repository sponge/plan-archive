Around 2:30 last morning, I turned our forums back on.  I figured out what caused the user database corruption and repaired the problem.

I would have said something about it in my finger, but our fingers are set up so they can only be accessed from behind our company firewall, and I was at home.  :)

There were about 5 user records who had signed up last night that had to be deleted to fix the problem, so if you are one of these people, feel free to sign up again.  Thanks!!
