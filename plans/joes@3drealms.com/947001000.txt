Work Stuff:

1) http://www.dopefish.com is changing servers.  There might be some weirdness over the next couple of days as the DNS works itself out (shouldn't start seeing the new server until tomorrow).  The new server has a message letting you know that you've reached the new server.  If you don't see said message, you're still working on the old DNS.  There is no new content on the new server, just a message saying "this is the new server".

2) Put Tim Weisser's web bio up on our site this morning.  It had actually been coded for a few weeks now, but I was going to wait till I psoted the new web site, which I was always under the impression was a few days away.    However, since that's been delayed now, I went ahead and put it online in the old site format.

3) I'm going to be installing a new version of the UBB software this afternoon.  It's supposed to work better with Netscape, cookies, and the "Y2k issue".  Let's see.  :)


Non-Work Stuff:

1) Finally got Seti@Home working here at the office.  Of course, I'm using the user name of Dopefish.  :)  What's funny about that is on the gajillion to 1 chance that something is actually found - can you see the headlines?  "Dopefish finds life in the galaxy".  :)

If there's anyone who is interested in joining the Dopefish SETI@home group, you can do so here:
