Work Stuff:

1) I'm going to be on the Daily Dementia on Friday.  TC Emailed me today and asked if I wanted to do it, and I said sure.  No clue what we're gonna talk about.  I'll probably get insulted for my taste in CD's.  :)  

2) As you know, our Live Cam has been down for some time.  The camera we were using is dead, and we need a replacement.  As such, I would like to hear your ideas on replacement hardware.  What I am looking for is something that doesn't have to be plugged into a computer to work, and has an out jack (RCA cable) that can be hooked into the video transmitter I use which transmits the signal from the camera back to my office for processing for the web.

Any ideas folks?

3) Ran across a program specifically designed to screw with those spammers who run software that does nothing more than search the web for Email addresses embedded into the mailto links.  Check this out: http://www.e-scrub.com/wpoison/.

4) More Eidos Booth Babes.  I don't remember who sent me this link, but here goes: http://www.ndsn.com/starcraft/pics/eidos/.  The woman who I gave an award to, but lost the picture of is in eidos_girls24.jpg.  Most of these are of Nell McAndrew (Lara).


Misc Stuff:

1) I just ran across (it's actually old, but I forgot about it for some time now) a page that says that there is a DVD out in Germany that has all three Wallace & Gromit adventures on it (http://rummelplatz.uni-mannheim.de/~mfeld/wg_laser.html).   Does anyone actually have this thing, and is there an NTSC version of that?  

I also did a Wallace & Gromit page - http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/3674/gromit.html.

2) I went through and purged my Netscape bookmark.htm file of a lot of old crap I haven't used in a long time.  When I started, the bookmark file was about 96k.  It's now around 64k, which is still huge, but my bookmark file hasn't been that small in quite some time. 

Here is a collection of links that I am dumping from my bookmark.htm file, and I figure if I stick them all into a plan update, then they'll be kept for all time, should I ever want to look at them again.  :)   There were a lot more that I didn't put here, since it was obvious what their URL's were (like the Chrysler car people, American Airlines, etc...)   I also didn't bother making this friendly for the web .plan archive sites, as there's a lot of links here, and I would have had to hand code all the URL's.  

HINT to people who run these sites: Make your scripts pick up URL's and automatically make them clickable!

Yesterday's .plan update:



12:28 PM 6/30/98

OK, here's my special "TC is gonna hate these" list of CD's I'm listening to:  :)

1) Michael Jackson - Dangerous
2) The Bangles - Greatest Hits
3) Huey Lewis - Greatest Hits
4) Yanni - Greatest Hits
5) Barry White - The Icon is Love
6) DJ Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince - He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper
7) Billy Joel - Greatest Hits Vol 3

And yes, I actually own all these.  Fnord.



Work Stuff:

1) I thought of this today when I was taking a shower (I don't know why I thought that, and I don't know why I'm telling anyone that), but I had a thought about Balls of Steel and Windows98.   If you install Windows98, it comes with DirectX built into it.  When you install Balls of Steel, it prompts you if you want to install DirectX v5.0.  Well, if you have Windows98 on your machine, and then go to install Balls of Steel, you should say "NO" to the install DirectX 5.0 prompt that comes up after all the files are copied over.   

I haven't actually tried it to see if the DirectX install is intelligent enough to know not to install if you attempt to "downgrade", but my recommendation is that you should say *NO* to the DirectX install prompt in the Balls of Steel CD install if you have Win98 on your machine at the time you go to install it.


Other Stuff:

1) Caught that they started pre-production work on Jurassic Park III to be in the theatres in 2000.  Here's a news story about it: http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/entertainment/story.html?s=z/reuters/980630/entertainment/stories/film_jurassicpark_2.html.

2) There's a pretty cool picture here from the new Star Wars movie.  Doesn't give anything away, it's just a promo picture.  However, I *VERY* much like the look they've given to Liam Neeson.

3) Did anyone happen to tape the final episode of a series called "Life Goes On"?  If so, drop me a line.

4) Finally saw "The Fifth Element" over the weekend.  Lynn & I went to Joe Ske's for dinner on Sunday (it was his birthday), and we watched that.  It was also my first taste of DVD-Dom.  Oh man, I want one even more now!   A
