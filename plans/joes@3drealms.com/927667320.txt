Oh dear god.  Please don't let this be true..  Leo DiCaprio as Anakin Skywalker in the second Star Wars film?  As if Jar Jar Binks wasn't bad enough...

1) We have just about all our domain names switched over to our new 
provider.  The only one left that hasn't been moved is 3drealms.com.
That's being submitted today, so there might be some minor weirdness
in the next 48 hours or so as the changes get processed.  Don't panic. :)    

2) We may not yet be done with the original Star Wars films.  Picked up this 
nugget over the weekend.  If true, they certainly know how to run the cash
cow. :) -  This text is not mine, it comes from one of my DVD news sites,
http://www.dvdfile.com.

Here we go again. I'm sure there will be much buzzing 
about this, so here goes. Corona is reprinting a newspaper story about 
Kevin Braun, a CGI artist (sort of a "hometown boy makes good" story). Near 
the end of the article, if the quotes are true, it appears there will be 
yet another version of Star Wars: A New Hope in theaters, and a DVD 
release. Um, when will this end? Will we ever see a final version of any 
Star Wars film? Can Mr. Lucas just pull that CG wand from out of his ass 
already and be done with it? (Oops, sorry...I promised to watch my 
language.)

Now, I will email Lucasfilm (but don't expect a response). I'm sure the web 
will be buzzing about this, so hopefully someone will get a good answer or 
update. Of course, as we know, Mr. Lucas has stated he wants to wait until 
all six films are done before the DVD. Perhaps, if this New Hope II thing 
is real, he is waiting to redo the films yet again before the DVD. Prepare 
for a long wait, young Jedi.

Interesting/cool/lame/whatever web sites I've visited lately, and wanted to point out:

1) http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/6172/
   A Really cool Austin Powers site
2) http://www.ihatestarwars.com
   Not for those who are bereft of a sense of humour, that's for sure.
3) http://unit.shada.com/
   Cool archive of Doctor Who video


CD's I'm listening to:

1) W.A.S.P. - Helldorado (new stuff)
2) Tony Martin - Back Where I Belong
3) My own MP3 archive.  :)

I'm also stuck with that Livin La Vida Loca song in my head.  Saw Ricky Martin
do it live on Saturday Night Live a few weeks ago, and it's been stuck in my 
head ever since.  I can't help it.  :)
