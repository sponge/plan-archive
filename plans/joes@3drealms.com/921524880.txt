Non Work Stuff:

1) Is there anyone out there who is familiar with Rolling Stones live set lists?  Question - did they ever do any material from the Undercover album on any tours other than that one?

2) Also, does anyone in the D/FW area (specifically Garland) know a good pinball repair person?  If so, please drop me a linke.

Work Stuff:

1) OH CRAP!  If you sent me any email over the weekend, it's been lost.  I downloaded all my mail this Monday morning, and then deleted my entire Inbox.  CRAP!!   If it was important, PLEASE PLEASE resend to me.  Thanks. BTW, this is only for stuff sent directly to me at joes@3drealms.com.  The Camera Captioning Contest is unaffected.

2) Sometime around the end of April, the 3D Realms web site will be moving servers.  I'll keep everyone posted on what's going on, as it will definitely involve a DNS change.

CD's I'm listening to over the last couple of days:

1) Black Sabbath - Forbidden & Seventh Star
2) Rolling Stones - Hot Rocks & Steel Wheels
3) Pink Floyd - Momentary Lapse of Reason
4) Spinal Tap - Break Like the Wind
