Work Stuff:

1) The Camera Captioning Contest that was scheduled to end yesterday has been extended another week.  I'm heavy into trying to finish off the new web site, and I'll change the contest when I launch the new web site.  I realize I've let a few contests slide without picking a winner, but I've been fairly busy as of late.  When I launch the new site, all will be there.  :)

CD's I'm listening to:

1) Santana - Supernatural
2) Hepcat - Right on Time
3) Iron Maiden - Seventh Son of a Seventh Son
4) Ozzy Osbourne - Bark at the Moon

Work Stuff:

1) If you get a minute, could you drop by our polling area at http://3drealms.3dportal.com/cgi-bin/multipoll.cgi and please answer the poll about what web browser you're using?  I'd really appreciate it.

2) Thanks to the ton of people who replied to my plan problem yesterday.  No one seemed to know how to use the Macro function built into FP2k.  Unfortunately, a bunch of people kept suggesting Dreamweaver.  Folks, I wasn't looking to switch stream and learn a new program just to fix a search/replace issue.  I wanted to know how to get around the issue with what I have.  :)

Other more realistic options were two programs called 'Search & Replace 98', and one called "Push that Damn Button".  The second is probably what I'll go with, as all I really need is something to push the buttons that FP2k presents me with.  Thanks to all that replied.

I'm really hoping to have this all done by the end of next week and possibly launch the week after that.  More on that next week.
