June 3rd:

This past Sunday, I went to see OzzFest with Richard Gray from
Hipnotic and another friend of mine Steve Quarrella (Gee, two ex
Apogeers :).  Anyway, this thing totally rocked.  Well, Ozzy &
Black Sabbath did.  The rest of the people blow, so we intentionally
went late.  It totally rocks.  Even without Bill Ward there, it
was awesome.  If you'd care to read my review of the concert, it's
over at my Black Sabbath site at http://www.black-sabbath.com under
Concert Reviews.

CD's I'm listening to:

Since I saw the band of the Gods on Sunday, I'm listening to nothing
other than Black Sabbath at the moment.  "Black Sabbath", Paranoid,
Master of Reality, Sabotage..    Ahhhh... Musical Ecstasy.

May 29th:

I've gotten a few E-Mails lately asking why I personally
haven't done any more levels for our games since i did about
20 or so for Rise of the Triad.  I wanted to say that I'm
pleased that some people out there care.  That was my first
game where I really had published work, and I'm sure as most
everyone in this industry can say, it's nice when your first
work gets noticed.  Why no more levels?  Ever try making a
ROTT level?  You can crank out a decent ROTT level in a day.
Build Levels take MUCH MUCH longer.  Sure, anyone can shab
together a Build level in a day, but if you want it to be
good, it's got to take longer than that.  I might take a 
crack at the Preditor and see what I can do though.  I do
miss level design, though.

Heard on the radio today that Howard Stern might not be on 
the air anymore in Dallas come August.  His contract is up,
and apparently the people who own KEGL don't want to renew
his contract.  That would really suck!  I've been listening
to Howard on and off for about 10 years now, since he first
hit Philly.

Metal CD's I'm listening to this week:

WASP - KFD (Still - It rocks)
Black Sabbath - Never Say Die
Deep Purple - The Battle Rages On

I've decided I'm not going to write about the same old stuff that you
see on all these other fingers, mine's gonna be non work related
usually. :)

BTW, I saw George go "Waaah" over getting 200 pieces of E-mail. Pffft. 
I can do that asleep. I get over 1,000 a day. :)

Anyone else out there have a USRobotics Pilot? When Tom Hall (of Ion
Storm) was at my wedding (Yeah! Tom was in my wedding), he showed me 
his Pilot, and I was hooked. I love the thing! Also, Paul Schuytema and 
Tom Pytel of 3D Realms also have 'em, and I was wondering who else in 
this industry has 'em.

Metal CD's to check out:

Queensryche - Hear in the Now Frontier
Black Sabbath - The Sabbath Stones (Import in US)
