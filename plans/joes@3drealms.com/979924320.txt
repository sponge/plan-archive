Does anyone know where I can buy a quantity of blank DVD cases?   This is for me personally, not for 3D Realms.  I'm looking for a quantity of around 50, preferably around 50-75 cents each.  

I also REALLY prefer them to be the Amaray cases.  The link below is what I'm looking for.  I've found a few places that sell 2 or 3 packs online, but they're never Amaray cases.

If you have a lead, please email me.  Thanks.
