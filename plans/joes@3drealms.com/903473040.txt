Work Stuff:


1) I'm getting really tired of seeing this graphic above.. This is really starting to piss me off.  What's with these people?  Why is this site always impossible to reach?  It keeps pages from loading.  Anyone have any info here?  It's not just in the game industry (3D Portal, Blue's, etc..) I'm seeing this problem elsewhere.  It's so bad that you have to load in a page, get stuck, hit escape, and just..  Oh dammit, why isn't this ad server reachable?  (rant off)

2) I'm going to be putting out a new issue of our email newsletter tomorrow.  Don't know why I'm mentioning it in my plan file, but since I'm here...

3) There's an interview with me over at The Apogee Temple.  Check it out...  http://www.3dportal.com/apogeetemple/.



Other Stuff:

0) It's my birthday on Thursday.  Number 33.  Robert Plant has the same birthday as me.

1) Is there anyone who plays Hardball 6?  If so, please Email me.

2) I actually watched an episode of South Park that I liked.  Normally I hate this show, but for some reason this one made me laugh (the one with the giant Snake Firework)


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Madonna - Ray of Light (One of my fav albums of the year)
2) Geezer - Black Science (One of my other favs of the year)
