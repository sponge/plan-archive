Quick question..  Anyone reading this have World Series Baseball for the Xbox?  If so, drop me an email at joes@3drealms.com.

Thanks.

P.S.  That date thing in my last plan update got screwed up.  I meant to say Dec 10, 1993 - not Dec 3, 1993.  It also had NOTHING to do with Duke as the flood of emails I got thought it did.  :)
