Hey gang.  Work continues on the new look site.  At the end of today, I'll have everything done and converted except the virtual tour and the product catalog (the two biggest parts).  I expect that we're going to put the new stuff online before the tour is done, as we may have a rethink on how the tour is done.

Anyway, I'm working on the Cheat Codes as I speak, and I wanted to put the codes for Duke on the N64, PSX, & Sega.  However, no one here knows what they are.  Is there anyone out there who knows a game site that has the full list of codes for these things?  If so, let me know.   

I see Stephen Cole talked about the Porcelain statues.  They're damn nice!  I have #72.  Don't know who has 69.  :)   I'm also sending some dig cam shots of the thing in my office to 3D Portal.
