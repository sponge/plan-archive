Work Stuff:

The web site is now done - and will be launching as soon as "Part Two" of the thing is finished and working correctly.  Can't say what "Part Two" is yet - that's a secret.  

However, once Pt 2 is done, it'll be a quick turnaround.   Thanks to the folks I contacted over the weekend who helped me out looking for errors.  You know who you are - your help was extremely valuable.


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Bill Ward - When the Bough Breaks
2) Santana - Supernatural (**OUTSTANDINGLY** good album)
3) Joan Jett - Fit to be Tied (Greatest Hits)
4) Metallica - S&M

Also heard a few new tracks from the new AC/DC album due out this month.  They still sound like AC/DC - Can't go wrong with the same cords all these years.  Here's a comment.  AC/DC is now 26 years old as a band - and Angus Young, their guitarist is only 40.
