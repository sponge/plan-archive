Work Stuff:

1) Today is the 5 year anniversary of the release of Rise of the Triad v1.0 shareware!  I did a short piece on it on http://www.3drealms.com - Check it out if you get a minute.

2) I installed a new version of the forum software that we use this afternoon.  Was a big update, the forums were down for like three hours.  All appears to be running well, though.  If you see any weirdness, please email me.
