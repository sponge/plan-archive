This is a bit of a strange personal request..

Is there anyone out there who remembers the mid/late 1980's Philadelphia Apple II BBSing scene?  Do you remember people like Mean Machine, Darkside, PeaceFrog, Sturm Brightblade, Siona, Baldrick (me)....?   If so, drop me a line, would ya?  I'd like to chat you up.  ESPECIALLY if you happen to _be_ one of these people.
