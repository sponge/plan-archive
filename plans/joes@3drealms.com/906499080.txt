I've returned from my vacation.   Spent the entire day doing Email and reading the msgs on our forum.

I've also got an ISP question.  Does anyone know of a national ISP that has the usual $20 a month unlimited usage and also has v.90 active and running NOW?   If so, drop me a line.  Thanks.   I have v.90 going on my local ISP here (for my home access), but when I was away on vaca, it occurred to me that if I wanted to use my net access I couldn't w/o calling Long Distance back to Dallas (not happening).

Was looking to see if any national ISP's (like Concentric or something like that - NOT CompuServe or AOL) have v.90 implemented now.
