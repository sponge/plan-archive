Work Stuff:

1) Progress is being made in the data conversion.  I'm still hoping that I'll be done with data conversion on Friday.  That doesn't mean I'll be uploading then, there's another issue that needs to be dealt with once I finish the data conversion.  More on that later.

Non Work Stuff:

A few odd things to ask about:

1) Does anyone know where to obtain "Iron City Light" beer in Dallas?  I used to have a source, but they stopped selling it.

2) Anyone reading this into mass transit as a hobby?  If so, I'm looking for some obscure information on the Philadelphia subway systems (both the Broad Street line & the Market/Frankford El).  Thanks.


CD's I'm listening to today:

1) Led Zeppelin - In Through the Out Door
2) Rainbow - The Very Best Of
3) W.A.S.P. - First Blood, Last Cuts
4) Black Sabbath - Born Again
5) Geezer - Plastic Planet & Black Science
