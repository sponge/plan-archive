Work Stuff:


1) I spent the better part of this afternoon revamping the old Camera Captioning Contest pages on our web site.  I went through all of them (back to the first one in May of 1996), and added a navigation scheme that will allow you to browse through all the old entries much easier than before.  I've had several people ask me about this recently, so I've added it.

Also, tomorrow, I'm going to go through and pick winners for all the pending contests.  The reason I hadn't picked any was that I was rather busy with the web site move(s), and unfortunately, I had problems even updating the news pages, let alone something like the camera contest.  I can post now (still not correctly, but I can do it now), so I'm going to tackle this (as the contest is due to change again in a day or so).  :)


2) Alert to the various finger archive folks (3D Portal, Quakefinger, etc...)  We're going to be changing our finger server shortly, which means all of our 3D Realms info will need to be updated.  Once I have some more info on what this change will entail (like what will need to be fingered, and when it will occur), I'll be passing on that info.   For now, nothing's changed, though.


Non Work Stuff:

1) I picked this up off the Dallas Stars Usenet group last night - it's just WAY too funny. :)  And before I get bitch mail about this, I thought it was a well played game - the goal WAS good - read the rules, and don't complain to me about how you can't interpret them correctly.  :)
