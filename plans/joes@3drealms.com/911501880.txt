1) Exactly one year from today, the new James Bond movie opens.  November 19, 1999.  The provisional title of the movie is "The World is Not Enough".  Make sure and check out this Bond site - it's totally awesome: http://www.mcs.net/~klast/www/bond.html.

2) Speaking of Bond, if you are into Bond, and you have a DVD player, you owe it to yourself to get the Tomorrow Never Dies Special Edition DVD that just came out this week.  This is an extremely good use of DVD features.

3) Speaking of DVD, Metallica has a cool DVD coming out next month (just in time for Xmas - snicker) called "Cunning Stunts".  It's filmed specifically for DVD, and makes extreme use of the "Multi Angle" button.  You're supposed to be able to pick whichever band member you want to look at for as long as you want to look at them, or take the "regular" video feed, as well as look backstage, and stuff like that.  Sounds sweet.

4) If anyone has the Flash Gordon DVD, please drop me a line about it.  I'm looking to find out what the content on it.  Is it just the movie and nothing else?

5) Boo-boo on yesterday's plan file.  Juan Gonzalez won the AL MVP two times in the last three years, not two.  Also, Sammy Sosa won the NL MVP today!


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Kiss - Psycho Circus
2) Van Halen III
3) The Who - Who's Better, Who's Best (Very Best of)
