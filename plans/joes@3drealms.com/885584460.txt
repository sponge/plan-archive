January 21, 1998

Balls of Steel - A master CD of the v1.1 revision was sent to GT for
final QA testing yesterday.  Once we hear back that there's no problems
with it, I'll be given the green light to release the update.  There 
will be a patch too (unless I can't figure out how to resolve some 
tricky issue with the patch process, but I don't think it will be a
real problem).  My last finger update had what's new in the new version.
If you're reading this on one of the finger sites that archives old
versions, you can check it out there.

New Web Site - I've begun the work on converting our web site over to
the new look.  The "Apogee 98" site as I'm calling it will allow me some
more screen real estate in working with things.  It's a very flexible 
format, and thanks again to Brian Cozzens for his damn nice layout.  It
should be more readable, as the background is white, and the text is 
black.  It works VERY well.

Trivia - The answer to my last question is Monster Bash, with 7 revisions,
all of them in 1993.  1.0 (Apr 9), 1.01 (Apr 10), 1.02 (Apr 12), 1.1 (Apr 26),
2.0 (May 11), 2.1 (May 23), "Lite Version" (Jul 27).

Question #2 - How many titles have Scott Miller & George Broussard personally
authored for the company (combined), and what are they? 

Dopefish - Forgot this was out there.  http://bounce.to/dopefish/.  I have
that as a link if you're familiar with the http://bounce.to site.

CD's I'm listening to -
John Mellencamp - Best I Could Do
Metallica - Reload (I like this more than Load)
Pat Benatar - Innamorata
Judas Priest - Jugulator
Black Sabbath - The Eternal Idol
Tomorrow Never Dies Soundtrack
