Work Stuff:

1) Testing to see if the finger archives pick this up.

Non-Work Stuff:

Picked this up off of Cinescape.  Ugh.  The Leo DiCaprio Star Wars Episode II stuff continues.  Read this.  This could be FAR FAR worse than Jar-Jar.

To those of you Star Wars fans who hold a grudge against Leonardo DiCaprio for mesmerizing teen girls everywhere enough to play a big factor in Titantic's smashing of Star Wars' box office record: Start panicking. In a chat last night, producer Rick McCallum addressed the Leonardo DiCaprio as Anakin Skywalker casting rumors ... and he didn't rule it out. "Both George and I love Leo's work, but we haven't even begun casting yet for Episode II, and won't until September or October," the producer said. For the record, the Insider loves the idea of Leo as Anakin. He's a great young actor (he certainly looks young enough to play 19), and he looks enough like Jake Lloyd for it to work. Backing up McCallum's claim that nothing is going on the casting front (at least as far as DiCaprio is concerned), were similar sentiments expressed by DiCaprio's reps to yours truly last week.
