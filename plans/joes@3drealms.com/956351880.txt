Work Stuff:

1) Someone the other day wrote me to ask me why I put a note in my .plan file saying that our site was down.  He went on to say "If you're down, how do you expect people to see the note saying that you're down"?  Well, the server that has our finger stuff is different from our web server.  :)


Non-Work Stuff:

1) Does anyone reading this happen to have a Phillips TiVO machine?  I'm looking into one, and was curious to know if anyone has any real world experince with the thing.  Thanks.


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Black Sabbath - Dehumanizer
2) Dio - Magica
3) Metallica - And Justice for All
4) Santana - Supernatural
5) AC/DC - Stiff Upper Lip
