Work Stuff:

1) Can anyone recommend some good E-Commerce site software?  I'm going to start looking at some of them, but the field is pretty wide open.  Was wondering if anyone had any real-life experiences they can pass on (good or bad).  Thanks.

2) One more license aquired that N64 fans will be happy to know about. "Nintendo Of America has picked up the video game rights to this movie. Nintendo's company Rare which worked on GoldenEye OO7 will help develop the game." If the TWINE game is half as good as the GoldenEye game was we'll be happy (although there might not be as many updates to the site when the game is released...)   (Not related to us, but the Goldeneye game was pretty popular - This was taken from the Corona Movie Preview site at http://corona.bc.ca/films/mainFramed.html.


Other Stuff:

1) I'm sure by now everyone knows what the Star Wars Promo Poster looks like.  With that in mind, you *MUST* see this.  It's friggin hysterical!  http://corona.bc.ca/films/details/simpsonswar.html

2) Any Doctor Who fans reading this?  A lost B/W Bill Hartnell episode has been found.  "The Lion" was unearthed in New Zealand (it's the first episode of The Crusades).  I'm one of these freaks that loves the old B/W Doctor Who stuff from the 60's.

3) Dammit.  Just bought Armageddon on DVD, and found out they're doing an "SE" for it in March..  Grr...

4) Saw that the DVD for Star Trek: Insurrection may be released in May.  When it is, there's talk of having some deleted scenes put in (the library stuff with Crusher, and the original ending to the movie).  Hope so.  Paramount does a crappy job with their DVD's anyway (Hello?  16x9 please?), this might go towards moving them in the right direction quality wise.

5) I did some poking around last week (as I was curious myself), and this is what I can find on Shawshank Redemption as a Region 1 DVD..

1) DVD File says "Cancelled due to Legal Reasons".
   http://www.dvdfile.com/release_index/discontinued.htm

2) DVD File also says "Scheduled for March 2nd"
   http://www.dvdfile.com/release_index/warner.htm
   (To be fair, DVD File also says he'll believe it when he sees it)

3) IMDB says "March 30, 1999"
   http://us.imdb.com/DVD?Shawshank+Redemption,+The+(1994)
   (Not sure how valid this information really is)

The Web DVD stores are equally confusing.  :)  Some of them don't have it listed at all.  Those are DVD Express, Amazon, Digital Eyes.  However, Netflix DOES have it listed. It says available on March 30, 1999.  They're taking orders for purchase and rental.  I also found it at 800.com (which seems to have the best price, as they're not charging for shipping).

I also found it listed as coming out on March 30 on DVD Review.  I also looked through that DVD Price Search site, and it also showed it as March 30th available through a few stores (they list Digital Eyes, when I could not find it myself on their site).  The couple of places that have it listed all have it listed at 16x9!

Quite frankly, I'm not sure what to believe.  I really want this film out, and I want it bad, as it's one of my all time favourites.  If it actually sees the light of day in Region 1, I'll snap it up the first day it's avaialble, as I have a feeling that if it continues to have legal trouble, it might get pulled if it does show up in March.  If anyone has any more **CONCRETE FACTUAL** knowledge as to what's going on with this title, I'd love to hear from you.

CD's I'm listening to:

1) Custom job I made for myself (Best of albums bought in 1998)
2) Deep Purple - Abandon
3) John Mellencamp - John Mellencamp
