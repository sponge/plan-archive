Work Stuff:

1) Sometime around the end of April, the 3D Realms web site will be moving servers.  I'll keep everyone posted on what's going on, as it will definitely involve a DNS change.

Non Work Stuff:

1) Thanks to everyone who replied about my pinball repair request.  I think I've found what I'm looking for - thanks to the guys over at Ensemble.

2) Does anyone know of a store (preferably a web store) that sells empty double CD jewel cases?  Not the regular (single) ones, but these new double ones that are the same physical size as a single, and have a "flippy" middle part where the second CD goes?  I'm looking for thse, and have never found them blank.

3) Is there anyone out there who is familiar with Rolling Stones live set lists?  Question - did they ever do any material from the Undercover album on any tours other than that one?

4) Anyone out there have a DVD copy of "While You Were Sleeping"?  If so, drop me a line, I have a couple of questions about it.


CD's I'm listening to over the last couple of days:

1) Queensryche: Operation Mindcrime (Oh my GOD is this an awesome album)
2) Megadeth: Peace Sells, but who's buying?
3) Rolling Stones: Undercover
4) Black Sabbath: Reunion

Games I'm playing lately:

1) Hardball 6
2) Need for Speed III
3) Unreal
4) Sim City 3000
