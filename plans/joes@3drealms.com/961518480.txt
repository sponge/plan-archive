OH CRAP!  This is an odd request, but I need to know if someone has this file on their system...  Around July 1998, I created a real Video file of Bobby Prince singing the lyrics to the Dopefish theme song.

I can no longer find this file.  Does anyone have it?  If so, please send me an email at joes@3drealms.com, as I want to get it back.  Thanks.
