Quite some time ago when I got a new car stereo, I remarked about a feature of the player where certain CD's had the song titles pre-loaded, they'd show up on my display.  I had never heard of it before, but there's 

I took a quick look around with Google, and a site cdtext.com simply forwards to a Sony Europe site with a 404.  Also found a CD Text FAQ here (http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~aa571/cdtext.htm) which linked to something that was a list of Sony CD's that supported it, but that too is a 404.

Does anyone know if there's a web site out there which catalogs which CD's have this feature available in them?  I know you can burn the stuff yourself, but that's not what I'm looking for - looking for some site that tells you which CD's you can buy in the store that have this built into them.

If I can't find it, I might consider starting one myself.
