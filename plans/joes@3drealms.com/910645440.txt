Picked this up today from the Official Star Wars Site..  (No spoilers, you're safe)


November 6, 1998 -- On Friday, November 20th, Star Wars fans (finally!) can get a glimpse of the upcoming Star Wars movie, as theaters across the U.S. and Canada will be showing trailers for Episode I The Phantom Menace. The trailer will not be attached to any particular film, but will instead play on a variety of films opening that weekend. (To be sure you get a chance to see the trailer, keep checking www.starwars.com for more information.) With over two minutes of footage from the new movie, which is scheduled to open in the U.S. and Canada on May 21, 1999, this will be an experience fans won't want to miss.


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Black Sabbath - Reunion
2) Brian May - Another World
3) Megadeth - Rust in Peace (their best disc)
