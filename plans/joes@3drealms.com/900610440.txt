Work Stuff:

1) I am working on some CGI scripts for our web site today, so if you connect to it and get no response, just wait a few minutes and try later.  It'll probably be up and down for a few hours this afternoon.


Thanks to everyone who bombed me with mail about my Fav Game News site question.  I wasn't doing that to conduct a poll mind you. :)

CD's I'm listening to:

1) Journey's Greatest Hits
2) Triumph - Classics
3) Pat Benatar - Innamorata
4) And a big Pfffft to TC..  Van Halen III
