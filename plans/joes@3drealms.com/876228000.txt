October 7th
-----------
I'm back from my mini-vacation; my parents were in town visiting
Lynn & I.  Was nice to see the parents.  Back to the grind.

I'm making a final push to finish the Balls of Steel help file,
as the game is due shortly.  More on that later.

We got our T1 hooked up here at the office; it should be operational
for all of us shortly.  For now it's only on one machine while we
set up all the security nonsense.  Was really neat watching it
download a 8Mb file in less than a minute.  :)

CD's I'm listening to (new stuff!):

Drain STH - Horror Wrestling
Rolling Stones - Bridges to Babylon
Genesis - Calling all Stations
Sheavy - Blue Sky Mind

Oh yeah..  HOW ABOUT THEM GIANTS!
