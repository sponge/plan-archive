January 29th, 1998 (Added a bit at the end of this rant about a movie.)

General rant about the state of the industry .plan files:

You know, I read the diatribe by Randy Pitchford, and I had this big
reply worked up (Chris Hargrove touched on most of it already, which was
the what about those of us who are happy here), but then I decided, why?

What's the point?  Life's too short to be caught up in pissing your time
away worrying about details and whatnot.  Even if someone got fucked out of
their royalties here (which I have no knowledge about - I intentionally try
and stay away from that issue here), so what?  (For the record, I got 
royalties on one thing, the ROTT addon pack, which was negligable money
anyway - I did that project for the love of the game, not the money).

The Lord and the Bible tell you to be happy with what you have, as envy is
not a thing to let drive you.  I love my job.  I've been at Apogee for
over 5 years, and I've seen an awful lot of people come and go.  Scott
& George have done a lot for me personally.  They've stuck their necks
out for me on more than one occasion when they didn't have to, not the
least of which was hiring me over the telephone back in the Fall of 1992
without ever seeing or meeting me at all.  Why do I think they did this?
I stuck my neck out for them.   I owe a lot to these guys, and quite frankly,
I feel that when people have a chip on their shoulder, or want to be a rock
star, they generally don't work well with anyone but themselves.  I've seen
a lot of "rock stars" come through here, and I won't say who, since I don't
feel like getting into that, but it just pisses me off about a lot of people
in this industry.

Get a clue.  Be happy with what you have, and you'll be a much happier person
overall.  I have an awful lot since coming here that I didn't have before, and
probably wouldn't have in my life.  Sometimes I think a lot of people in this
industry would be a lot happer if they a little religion in their lives.  

Some people might see this as my sticking my toungue way up the ass of management
here.  If you want to take that kind of attitude, then fine.  Be that way. 
All I can say to that is that this is a genuine feeling, my religion allows me
to be nice to people w/o having to feel like I'm kissing up to them.  When
someone does something nice for me, I tell them.  Period.

I normally only talk about game stuff, and what CD's I listen to in my plan
file, but the fact that so many people spend so much of their time whining
about something is really annoying.  I've seen quite a few arguments since 
a few web sites started archving all these finger plans by everyone, it almost
makes me wish the resource wasn't available so we wouldn't have to listen to
all the bullshit that comes out of people's mouths (ok fingers).  And yes,
I realize that I'm using the same vehicle that I'm bitching about to say this,
so there's no need to point that out.

In closing, I'd like to say just one word.

Fnord.

ADDED IN LATER:

I didn't change anything on my rant, I wanted to add this. One of my all time
favourite movies has been remade.  It's "The Taking of Pelham 123".  This is 
a really cool concept.  4 guys hijack a New York City Subway Train.  I won't
say anything else other than that.   Originally made in 1974 with Walter
Mattheau, Robert Shaw, & Martin Balsam.  I love this movie, and have for a long
time.  They REMADE IT!

It's gonna be on Sunday night after the ProBowl on ABC.  Unfortunately, the
biggest actor I've ever heard of in the remake is "Donny" Wolhberg.  Ugh...
Anyway, I'm still gonna watch it, even though I'm not expecting a whole lot
out of the remake.  Here's a couple of web sites about it (although I expect
the ABC one won't be here at all after Sunday):
