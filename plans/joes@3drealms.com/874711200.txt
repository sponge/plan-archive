A quick note to let everyone know that this morning I was 
informed that we had finished shipping all direct pre-orders
for Shadow Warrior, and are now working on "new current" orders.

So, if you ordered it direct from us, it's on it's way.  :)

Personal Stuff:

Found my SNES Super Bomberman cartridge.  Forgot about it; this
is a damn fun game!  Shot a 209 last night at bowling.

CD's I'm listening to:

Queen - Greatest Hits 1 & 2
Megadeth - Cryptic Writngs
Geezer - Black Science
WASP - KFD
ZZ Top - Rhythmeen
Ozzy - Live & Loud

I also added a better script on our web site for fingers that
looks like our site.  If you've spent any time looking at the
game industry web community lately, you should recognize the
script.  It's the PlanetQuake finger stuff.  Thanks a ton 
to James Groat for all his help in getting this going. Lee 
Jackson, our Music & Sound Director has also been added to
the list.

Shadow Warrior is done, done, done!  It's been a long time 
coming, but we're expecting our shipment of CD's today (It's
3:30PM when I write this, and they're still not here), and
GT is expecting to ship to stores on Monday.  It's nice to be
done with the game after so long.  

The next new game is Balls of Steel, which shouldn't be all
that far behind.  Shadow Warrior is also our final DOS game.
All other games under development are Windows95/98 games.

Personal Stuff:

I took my first vacation this year last weekend.  Went home to 
visit my family, as my brother got married.  I'm still dealing
with a super huge swamp of E-mail that was waiting for me when
I got back.  Still have a few hundred to answer, I should catch
up some time next week.

Started my bowling leagues this week.  I'm 32, and this is my
25th consecutive year in a bowling league.  Just in case you
are wondering, I average about 160.  Highest game is 257.

I saw Scott's little dig at me in his plan file.  I'm a big
Eagles fan, and I totally hate the Cowboys, and take a lot of 
crap for it.   All I have to say is this.  HA!  Arizona Cardinals
beat you into the desert!  And we beat the Green Bay Packers!
I'm going to the game on Monday night.  I expect the Eagles to
lose, but then again, unlike Cowboys fans, I still like my team
when they lose.

I also cleared out a lot of the old dead wood in my finger plan.
Wish some of the others would do so, it's annoying downloading
a 25k .plan file sometimes.  :)
