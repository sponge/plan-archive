We just got another update of BOS from the team in Australia.
It's looking real good, and I'm making a final push to get the
help file done.  This is the first Windows Help file I've ever
made, so it's a learning experience.  I've been doing the tech
files for all of our games since Bio Menace.  That was the
first game of ours to have one (I thought of the idea). 

Anyway, about BOS, it's close, should be out soon, if all 
goes well, but don't forget to take a good look at the 
"When it's done" sign on the wall.

There's a bunch of help programs out there, but the one I'm
using is "HelpScribble".  It's cheap compared to a lot of
the other ones out there, and it does the job.

Personal Note:

While writing this, my brother called me, and told me that the
pet cat we had for 17.5 years was put to sleep today.  Kind of a
sad moment for me, as I grew up with the cat, it was a good
friend to me for a good number of years.  I'll miss her.
