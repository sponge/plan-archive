Work Stuff:

1) OH CRAP!  If you sent me any email over the weekend, it's been lost.  I downloaded all my mail this Monday morning, and then deleted my entire Inbox.  CRAP!!   If it was important, PLEASE PLEASE resend to me.  Thanks.

2) Sometime around the end of April, the 3D Realms web site will be moving servers.  I'll keep everyone posted on what's going on, as it will definitely involve a DNS change.

CD's I'm listening to over the last couple of days:

1) Black Sabbath - Forbidden & Seventh Star
2) Rolling Stones - Hot Rocks & Steel Wheels
3) Pink Floyd - Momentary Lapse of Reason
4) Spinal Tap - Break Like the Wind
