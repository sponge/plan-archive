Getting real close with Balls of Steel.   I'm going to wrap up the
help file and the installation program today or tomorrow, and then
I'm told to start getting ready for the final push next week.  Once
we work out a release date, I'll let ya know.

I know that a lot of people around here use ICQ, and I do too (no
I'm not posting my number here), and I just read an article about
something that might pose a serious threat to ICQ.  It's something
in the next version of Netscape that will let Netscape users have
the same type of feature, only it will be merged with AOL's Buddy
List, so it will have an immediate user base of 9 million people,
even before Netscape is invovled.  Check out the article here:

Personal Stuff:

I noticed Scott Miller is no longer posting his ridiculous Cowboy
predictions now that they're losing most of the time.  Typical Cowboy
fan.  Don't talk about them when they're losing.  :)

CD's I'm listening to:

Roger Waters - The Pros & Cons of Hitchhiking
Roger Waters - Amused to Death
Megadeth - Cryptic Writings
Black Sabbath - Sabbath Bloody Sabbath
Pink Floyd - A Momentary Lapse of Reason
