Star Wars Stuff (absolutely no movie info here):

1) I picked up this stuff from Cinescape Online.  (http://www.cinescape.com/insider).  It's rules laid down by Lucasfilm in regards to what theatres can do with the Phantom Menace movie.  Check it out.  Some interesting stuff in here:

As previously rumored and reported in the Insider, for a theater to be allowed to show Star Wars: Episode One - The Phantom Menace, they are going to have to follow a number of strict requirements. Today's Variety finally put together the full list which I'll provide to you now:

*  Phantom Menace must be shown in the largest theater or auditorium of a complex for the minimum required length of the run of the film. 

*  As reported yesterday from the Insider's source, the film must stay in that theater for a period of 12 or 8 weeks depending on the market. This is for films that open on May 19. Theaters that open the film on June 18 must show it for four-weeks. 

*  If a theater has committed to showing the film on two or three screens, the film must stay on those screens for the minimum required amount of time per instructions above. 

* The film must play on three screens sin competitive areas where more than one exhibitor has theaters. Exhibitors will get "100% of their house allowance for the first screen, 50% for the second and 25% for any additional screens." That last point suggest more than the three screens that were previously reported to be the limit. 

* Interlocking, which allows a theater to screen a single print on two screens, will be forbidden. One print per screen. This is gonna be expensive! 

* "Exhibitors may not deduct additional security expenses from rental fees." 

* As expected, theater passes will not be honored, in this case for the firsts eight weeks. 

* "Payment is to be made within seven days (30-60 days is typical) for the first several weeks." 

* Paid advertising on the same screen between showing is prohibited for the first two weeks. 

* Trailers may be shown as long as they don't exceed 8 minutes of time. The trade also reports that Fox has attached 2
