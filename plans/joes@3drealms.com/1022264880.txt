Work Stuff:

1) Some good looking stuff coming out of E3.  The first time I wanted to go and couldn't - I finally get back into the world of console gaming this past Xmas by getting both an Xbox & a Gamecube, and I can't go to E3 to check out the new stuff.  Waaah!  :)

2) Dec 3, 1993?  Dec 3, 2003?  ;)


Non Work Stuff:

1) I don't know how many of you reading this follow baseball well, but I do - I'm a big baseball fan, and ran across something a couple of days ago that fans of baseball might get a kick out of.  As you know, there was an attempt this past off season (an ill advised attempt, IMHO) to eliminate two teams via contraction.  The Twins & the Expos.

Well, there's a web site that is pushing a very cool idea which, if it flies, would be a big ol' middle finger to Bud Selig.  It's an attempt to vote in all the Expos & Twins players as starters to the All Star Game (which is in Selig's own team's ballpark this year).

Check out the web site here: http://voteexpostwins.0catch.com

It's quite an amusing prospect - even if it doesn't fly, I expect some Expos & Twins players will place higher than they would have had otherwise.  Check it out - you can vote 25 times (per registered email account), so it's definitely something that's easy to do.  :)
