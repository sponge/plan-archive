Stuff:

1) I've been playing a lot of Hardball6 lately.  I can't bat worth a damn, but I'm having a lot of fun with it.  Anyone else play this?

2) This is going to be a REALLY strange request, but I have a personal reason for looking for this.   Is there anyone who happens to have a copy of the Bonanza Christmas album?   The thing with Lorne Greene, Michael Landon, et al?  If so, contact me.

3) Alien Resurrection comes out on tape tomorrow, and Tomorrow Never Dies comes out on the 12th.

4) If you haven't done so already, visit the "No Divx" page at http://techzone.weezy.com/.  Divx bites wind.  It shouldn't be allowed to proliferate.  Some rich bastard somewhere apparenetly thought of this idea as a way to make themselves even richer.  Do what you can to kill the format.
