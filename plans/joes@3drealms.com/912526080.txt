1) The Dallas Morning News in Yesterday's "Parade" section awarded Half-Life the "Hottest New Game" award in the multi-player games category.  This is what they had to say:

>> HALF-LIFE.  A 3D first-person shooter in which players work with security guards and scientists while killing monsters and government soldiers.  Half-Life is the thinking-man's DOOM. (Sierra $50). <<

2) Finally saw the Star Wars Trailer in the theatre.  Went and saw "A Bug's Life" on the 25th, and they had the SW Trailer in front of it.  What was also cool was they had the Star Trek: Insurrection Trailer right after that.  :)   I also got a big kick out of Bug's Life.  Probably one of the best G Rated movies I've seen in awhile.

3) Pink Floyd's "The Wall" was released today back in 1979.  God this makes me feel old, as this album was the shit when I was in High School; I was in 9th grade when this was released.  (If you don't feel like doing the math, I'm 33)

4) Amazon.com is having a totally awesome sale on DVD's right now.  Their Top 100 Sale CD's are 50% off, which is some insane pricing.  For example, the 4 DVD set "From the Earth to the Moon" is only $59.99 - This thing is usually around $100 or more in stores, or other web sites I've seen.  They're also taking pre-orders on some things like Armageddon for only $14.99.  There are some really awesome deals on DVD's.  Head over to Amazon, and click on "Video", and you'll see the "Top 100 DVD sale" link.  They rock.  :)

5) How can you blow the coin toss?


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Pink Floyd - The Wall
2) Black Sabbath - Reunion
