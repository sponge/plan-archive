Just a quick note.  It was a georgeous weekend here in Dallas this weekend.  I had forgotten how cool it is to get outside, and take a walk in the park, throw around a football, and sit by a lake watching ducks, and that kind of stuff.  Makes me realize that sometimes I spend too much damn time in front of the computer.  If you get a chance, go outside and enjoy some real life, lest it pass you by.


Make sure to read my finger update previous to this one, as I have several things in there that should be read.  :)
