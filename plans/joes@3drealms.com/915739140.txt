Work Stuff:

1) There was some weirdness on our forums this morning.  It was preventing messages from being seen.  That has been cleared up, and all is well there again.

2) There's a problem on the server that hosts our web site where I can't easily edit things right now.  It should be cleared up shortly.  That's the reason updates are a little slower than normal, since I need to do everything by hand (Ughh).  

3) (Saw this on Gamepost) SimCity Classic Free on the Web: Maxis, a division of Electronic Arts, is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its multimillion-selling SimCity Classic game by making the groundbreaking metropolis-building game available on the Web free of charge. The free version of SimCity Classic is part of a new Web site, devoted exclusively to SimCity, the game line that has sold over five million copies worldwide. The Net version, while still a single-player game, allows players to chat and exchange tips with one another while building their imaginary cities.  The website is http://www.simcity.com
 

Other Stuff:

1) Anyone else think the "new look" of OGR news is just too cluttered for it's own good?  That used to be one my daily visits, but the thing looks just too cluttered for me to want to pay any attention to it.

2) Saw today that George Lucas now plans only 6 episodes of Star Wars, not the original 9 that he had talked about around 1980.  If you want to read a news story about this, go here:  http://us.imdb.com/StudioBrief/1999/19990105.html#1.

3) Damn.  Looks like they solved the NBA lockout.  I was REALLY hoping the season would be cancelled.  Of course, my dream was that the whole SPORT would be cancelled, but hey.  :)

4) Anyone out there have a Scared Stiff Pinball machine, or at least play one regularly?  Drop me a line.

5) Don't know if anyone cares or not (probably not), but I paid off my car loan today.  2 1/2 years early!  Woo-hoo!  :D
