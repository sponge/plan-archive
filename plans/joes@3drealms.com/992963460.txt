Go check that out.  Bill Gates recently donated $100 million to the UN in support of AIDS research.  Our industry (and a HUGE amount of the fans, too) seems to be permeated with the notion that "Microsoft is huge, fuck 'em".  I disagree with that, and when I see something like him donating this much cash to medical research, I believe he should be applauded.

I'm sure I'll get a bunch of emails going "Fuck you - Microsoft sucks, Linux is the future, you're not l33t - woot!", but it won't matter to me.  Anyone who can afford to donate this kind of money *AND ACTUALLY DOES IT* should be applauded.
