Work Stuff:

1) Down to just four days of the Dementia a week.  Just one more day of death a week now, TC.

2) Moving along with the Virutal Tour.  Hit a minor snag, though.  The tripod I'm using is broken, which makes the pictures I take come off a little crooked.  If I can't fix it, I'm gonna have to get another one.   :(


Personal Stuff:

1) The Tomorrow Never Dies DVD is sold already.  :)

2) (Repeat from last .plan update) This is a bit of a strange personal request..

Is there anyone out there who remembers the mid/late 1980's Philadelphia Apple II BBSing scene? Do you remember people like Mean Machine, Darkside, PeaceFrog, Sturm Brightblade, Siona, Baldrick (me)....? If so, drop me a line, would ya? I'd like to chat you up. ESPECIALLY if you happen to _be_ one of these people. 

3) Check out your local rock stations now.  Why?  The new Black Sabbath album, Reunion, is scheduled to be played in it's entirety on several radio stations around the country tomorrow evening.  I have a few of them listed over on my Black Sabbath site at http://www.black-sabbath.com, but you might be better off finding out on your own, as I only know of a few of them personally.

4) Season premiere of Star Trek: Voyager (Year 5) is tomorrow night.


CD's I'm listening to (been awhile):

1) Metallica - ReLoad
2) David Gilmour - David Gilmour
3) Black Sabbath - The Eternal Idol
4) Kiss - Psycho Circus
5) Geezer - Black Science (get this thing!)
6) Brian May - Another World
7) Deep Purple - Abandon (New stuff!)
