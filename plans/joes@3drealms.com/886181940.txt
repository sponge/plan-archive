Shadow Warrior:
---------------
The Shadow Warrior 3Dfx patch v1.1 is out.  It's on our web site.  Go
get it.  I'm sure it will be on all the related sites this afternoon.


Balls of Steel:
---------------
I've been told that Balls of Steel v1.1 has passed GT QA, which means
that the v1.1 CD's are going into production, and will be shipped to
the stores shortly.  The shareware v1.1 and the patch to update v1.0
and v1.1 will go online right after our new web site look goes online,
which is slated to be early to mid next week.


Prey:
-----
Oh My GOD!  I took a look at what they were doing again this week.  
That's about all I can say (That's a good Oh My GOD, BTW :)


Unprofessionalism:
------------------
I used to think that the remark "All other games will go sit in a corner
and urinate on themselves" was the most unprofessional thing I've seen
uttered by someone in this industry.  It's been topped (unfortunately).


The Taking of Pelham 123:
-------------------------
I mentioned this yesterday, but some people weren't aware I had added it
after my rant yesterday, so here it is again:

One of my all time favourite movies has been remade. It's "The Taking of 
Pelham 123". This is a really cool concept. 4 guys hijack a New York City 
Subway Train. I won't say anything else other than that. Originally made 
in 1974 with Walter Mattheau, Robert Shaw, & Martin Balsam. I love this 
movie, and have for a long time. They REMADE IT!

It's gonna be on Sunday night after the ProBowl on ABC. Unfortunately, the
biggest actor I've ever heard of in the remake is "Donny" Wolhberg. Ugh...
Anyway, I'm still gonna watch it, even though I'm not expecting a whole lot
out of the remake. Here's a couple of web sites about it (although I expect
the ABC one won't be here at all after Sunday):
