Work Stuff:

1) Does anyone know what a .jsp file is?  I've got one sitting in my "My Documents" folder, and I have no clue what it is.  I asked around here, and no one knew either.  

2) Just heard about Redwood.  Hope all goes well on the recovery side, dude...


Misc Stuff:

1) Do you play Monopoly?  Well, I found out they're planning on adding a new piece to the game that you can play as.  It's the first time since 1950 they've done that.  Go check out http://www.monopoly.com for info on the three choices - they're putting it to a public vote.

2) This is damn funny.  If you've ever worked in Tech Support, or just want a laugh, you owe it to yourself to go here: http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/2968/cuphold.htm.

3) Is there anyone out there with old Atari 2600 cartridges collecting dust?  If so, drop me a line.

4) I read in Cinescape this weekend that Paramount plans to release the second Beavis & Butthead movie at the exact same time as the new Star Wars movie (Memorial Day 1999).  :)

5) Saw on Redwood's that Fox has announced open DVD Support.  Yay!  Also, Paramount has announced their first DVD titles to be released October 6th.  Listed FIRST on their announcement list is Star Trek: First Contact.  If you want to see what else they are planning, check out the link here: http://www.thedigitalbits.com/paramount.html.


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Anthrax - Vol 8: The Threat is Real
2) Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here
3) Brian Setzer - Dirty Boogie
4) Iron Maiden - Virtual XI
