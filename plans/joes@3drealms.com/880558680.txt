About my Company:
-----------------

Today is a landmark day in the industry.  Today is what has been
decided as the 10 year anniversary of the birth of Apogee.  
On November 26, 1987, Scott Miller submitted the first episode
of Kroz to Softdisk.  Scott had been doing games for some time,
but this is regarded as the "Birth of Apogee".  An awful lot of
what is happening today in this industry, both the Dallas scene,
and the (er) larger people is a direct result of this action
10 years ago.

Personally, I owe a lot to Scott, as he was real nice to me 5 
years ago when I moved to Dallas to take this job, and is still
nice to me all these years later (Hell, 5 years anywhere in
this industry is ancient history).  My actual 5 year anniversary
here is December 14th.

If you want to read more history about us, I've recently put
together a page on our web site that details the release dates
for everything we've put out.  You can get to it at

Balls of Steel:
---------------
I found out that Balls of Steel full version passed the final
QA testing at GT, and it's gone off for mass duplication and 
shipment to stores.  Yay!

Just some final tweaking to the shareware table (which is 
Darkside), and then that will be released.  That should still
be out before the full version hits the shelves.

CD's I'm listening to:
----------------------
Motley Crue - Generation Swine
Rainbow - Rising
Black Sabbath - Technical Ecstasy
