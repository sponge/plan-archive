I've moved my .plan file to 3dportal.com.  The reason for this is
that it's a lot easier for me to manipulate my own finger this way,
until we finalize our net access for our offices.  

For the time being, you can finger me at jsiegler@3dportal.com.

Here's a current complete list of all fingers for our company
personnel (This will be much more standardized once we finalize
our in house net access).  I realize it looks messy with fingers
and E-Mail all over the place, but that's why we're finally doing
our own inhouse net access.

1) Scott Miller - Prez of Apogee
   Finger: scottm@mailhub.gte.net
   Email: scottm@3drealms.com

2) George Broussard - Prez of 3D Realms
   Finger: georgeb@mailhub.gte.net
   EMail: georgeb@3drealms.com

3) Paul Schuytema - Prey Producer
   Finger: pauls@mailhub.gte.net
   EMail: pauls@3drealms.com

4) William Scarboro - Lead Prey Programmer
   Finger: williams@mailhub.gte.net
   EMail: williams@3drealms.com

5) Joe Siegler - Webdude
   Finger: jsiegler@3dportal.com
   Email: joe.siegler@apogee1.com

6) Lee Jackson - Music & Sound Director
   Finger: ljackson@3dportal.com
   Email: ljackson@nstar.net

7) Scott McCabe - Prey Artist
   Finger: smccabe@3dportal.com
   Email: smccabe@3dportal.com

Work Stuff:

Lee Jackson's finger is offline. I pointed out to him that
QuakeFinger's script was choking trying to read his .plan. He did some
checking, and found out that his provider (nstar.net) has decided that
"for security's sake", they were going to remove all non local access
to the .plan files, which means that anyone outside of nstar.net can't
read Lee's .plan file.

We are supposed to be getting our own net access in November (if all
goes well), and at that time, (I'm told) everyone here will have their
own E-Mail and .plan files, so we shouldn't have these problems (and
there will be real email addresses, not this
joe.siegler@jefferson.gte.net stuff).

I've also been told that myself, Scott, George, & Paul could also lose
our .plan access for the same reason as nstar claimed. I'm hoping our
current ISP will let us carry on till then.

Due to popular demand, I put a picture of Stephen Cole's desk on the
net. http://www.dopefish.com/2.jpg. Check it out. :) The number of
cups has increased radically since I took that picture.

Personal Stuff:
---------------

* Man, I bowled some awesome stuff last Thursday. 191-210-182. It's
  been awhile since I bowled like that. :)

* I agree with Scott. If you're on MNF and need a field goal
  to win the game, forget it. Go for the touchdown. If you
  want to get in on a national "Football Pool", go here:

http://games-espn.sportszone.com/cgi/pigskin/Request.dll?FRONTPAGE

That's ESPN's "Pigskin Pick 'em". You can play against pretty much the
world in picking games. And it's the way I like it, straight up. None
of this point nonsense.

* Speaking of links, there's a really cool page out there for an
  emulator called MAME, which lets you play original arcade ROM's. Not a
  port, but the _REAL_ roms. 
  Check it out at: http://www.media.dsi.unimi.it/mame/

Current CD's (I'm freaking myself out here):

Newsboys - Take me to Your Leader (Christian Rock)
CCR - Chronicle (Greatest Hits)
Tom Petty - Greatest Hits

Elvis Presley - The Number One Hits ?!?!?
The Best of Star Trek - 30th Anniv CD
