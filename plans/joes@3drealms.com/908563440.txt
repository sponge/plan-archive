Work Stuff:

1) It would appear the Duke Nukem: Time to Kill is hitting the stores today.   I got an email from someone who said he picked up one, and was planning on playing the hell out of it this weekend.  Here's a bit from his text:

>> It came in at Waldensoftware in Middletown, OH yesterday.  And I checked and Electronics Boutique also has it today in Cincinnati. <<

2) Virtual Tour is almost done.  I expect it to be online next week unless something totally disastrous happens.


Personal Stuff:

1) Week from Monday is my two year wedding anniversary!  :)  (I know, who cares, but I wanted to say it anyway)


CD's I'm listening to:

1) Kiss - Psycho Circus (this thing is better than I was expecting)
2) Van Halen 3 - (still love this and they have a new studio album planned for 99!)
3) Black Sabbath - Forbidden
4) Tomorrow Never Dies Soundtrack
5) Metallica - Reload
