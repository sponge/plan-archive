------------
Just to let some people know, the reason I haven't updated our
site in the last couple of days is that I've been sick as a dog.
Caught some sort of stomach virus that's been making me puke a 
lot, as well as several other gross things that I probably don't
need to mention here.

I don't post this for sympathy (people send me E-mail on some of
the smallest detail things I put in this .plan), but simply to 
let some people know why I haven't updated our news site with 
some info in the last couple of days (I was asked about it).

Hopefully, if I'm not still a puke machine when I get up in the
morning, I'll go in to work, and then the world will be great
(No it won't, but when you're awake at 3:15AM, haven't slept 
in almost 24 hours, haven't slept more than a couple of hours
in almost 72 hours, and haven't eaten *A THING* in 2 full days,
(except for one small bowl of instant mashed potatoes) you do 
silly things.  Like this .plan update.

Fnord.
