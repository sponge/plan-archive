Yes, that is my real name.

Ok, when you saw Wolf you spooged on your own knees right?
Then DOOM came out and you spooged all over yourself again,
only this time more. "Wow!", you thought, "I didn't know I
could spooge _that_ much!"
Just wait till Quake, you'll be mopping spooge for days.

We have completed quite a few small maps and
several larger maps. Creating Quake maps is a lot more
detailed than making DOOM maps. Since you have so many
options now you spend a lot of time trying to figure out
which of your cool ideas to use... instead of having to
throw them away because the engine cannot handle what
you want to do. Creating floors above floors is very cool
and creates some really beautiful scenes. The lighting
is a lot of fun... but if you are not careful you can
spend way too much time just moving lights around to
see what things look like:)
I am also working on the doors/plats/buttons/triggers
and weapon code. Creating doors and other simple objects
is the game is a breeze. You simply create the model
that you want to represent the object... write some
code for when it is "touched" and "used" and then throw
it into the map. Object like weapons are much the same.
You just think of the type of weapon you want to have,
figure out how to make it work, code it in, and then
throw it into the map.
btw: The maps we are working on are going to be very
cool for DM. Quake maps will be small to medium in size
because we have found that maps this size are more fun
to play in single and multiplayer. There will be some
larger maps... but in general we are trying to keep
the sizes down.
