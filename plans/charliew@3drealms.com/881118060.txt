Work Stuff 
----------
I'm really looking forward to making some of the maps that are currently
running through my mind and into this game design. Heck, I'm looking forward
to playing them! Started work on a 32 player DM map for SiN. These things
are simply huge! You could literally fight the entire match and never see half
the other people in the game. I look forward to seeing how teamplay or clan
matches would turn out in something like this. Might be quite interesting.

Since I'm such a huge Team Fortress fan, I might decide to make a Team Fortess
map for Quake 2 when(if?) the mod gets made. Then again, there might not be a
reason to since the 2fort4 layout will most likely be recreated again and used
everywhere. Someone brought up the issue of having a true "fortress" match
with the all out 200 players on a server. I definately can't wait to see how
that pans out... but heck, I have enough trouble surviving as a scout now
with only 16 people after my head, much less 100! ;) Imagine a line of 10 good
snipers guarding the entrance. *Ouch*

Uhh... not much. Hopefully will be going car shopping this week (finally). I
have been bumming rides off of people since after I sold my 1977 Thunderbird
the summer after my senior year in high school. I miss that car... it was soo
cool. I definately plan to eventually buy one again and restore it. Talk about
power in a car. I don't know a damn thing about engines, or what have you...
but when I can cruise down a back road at 100+ mph and feel like I'm going
60 mph down the freeway... you know you have something good. Plus, the car
is just a fortress. Don't even think of getting in my way cause I'll just
plow right through ya! :) Anyways... what I'm most likely going to be getting
is a Ford Ranger. Nice solid little truck that looks sharp. I might get a
full size pickup like an F150, but I dunno.

Why get a truck instead of a sporty car like the rest of the guys in this
biz? Because this is Texas!! Ummm... yeah.

Listened to Les Miserables all day today. I still find it hard to believe that
such classic music was actually written during my lifetime. 1985 was the first
year of performance. Cool, that means that the 80's is still my favorite
time period for music. Haha.

Oh yeah, the thing I was going to say in my last update but forgot about was 
that there is a new interview with me up at The Ultimate SiN by Hexagon.
