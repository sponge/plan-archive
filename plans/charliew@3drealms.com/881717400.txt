Work Stuff
----------
Looks like... ummm... I will be able to start working on some real single
player maps real soon. Yeah! That of course, means that the DM map(s) will
be put on the backburner and worked on off and on. I'll probably set aside 
about an hour a day to work on it/them (still uncertain as to if I'll be
breaking the map down into several smaller DM maps yet or not).

Probably the most well received idea so far regarding large numbers of
players on a server is the concept of the "Track Meet" system. I hope that
someone eventually makes a rocket arena or 1 on 1 mod that will allow this
sort of thing. And how about tag team situations, and simple team play
goal oriented things. I am really look forward to playing some stuff like 
that.

Other Stuff
-----------
I picked up my new truck tonight. If buying a vehicle is this much trouble
every time then I'm just gonna walk when the lease on this one is out. :)
I wound up buying a 1998 Ford F150 with a big v6. That's about all I know
in the technical area. I tried the Rangers, and I really still like them...
but when it comes to just simple get up and go it didn't have enough. So I
tried this lonely solid black one down at the end of the line and loved it!
It feels sooo good to not have to depend on other people for rides anymore.
For all you people in those little wimpy sports cars... watch out for the
big black demon running up behind you. Course, once the light turns green
you'll speed away but hey... it'll scare you for a minute! :)
