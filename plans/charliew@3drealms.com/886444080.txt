Wow... being 21 feels like a totally different world than 20. Ok... maybe
not.

Something to chew on: In action games, is it really the killing that gives
you the thrill, or is it the survival? Personally, I think it is the
survival. The violence is merely a means to an end (and what a cool one at
that!!!) but I like seeing new ways to survive other than killing everything.

There is a new interview with me up at http://www.gaminator.com
But unless you can read Japanese... I doubt you will be able to read it. :)
I think they are going to send the English version to Ritualistic.com, but
not sure.

Wieder rolls on outta here...
