Work Stuff 
----------
Well, design stuff for the future project is going really well... Patrick,
Mike, Joe, and I have been pounding away at it and I like the action. Heck,
I think I'll write up a script and get Hollywood to produce it. Maybe not. :)

The 32 player DM map that I thought was huge... well... it grew. I tend to do
this. I start out with this idea, and I think "Ohh... this won't take too
long". But the next thing I know I've added to the idea... and each addition
seems like it won't take that much longer. And it won't. But get quite a few
of those additions and you suddenly have a monster. :) So, the layout of the
map is now designed to handle the much larger numbers of players that Q2 and
all of its licenses will take advantage of. The thought of 100+ players on
one server in one map still boggles my mind... but looking at the layout I 
can imagine it actually happening. *shudder* The cool thing, is that there
really isn't any reference to go off of on exactly how a 100+ player map
should be handled. So I sit back and watch some of the larger games of Team
Fortress, Rocket Arena (teams), and normal DM games. I have spectated a few
matches to see where some of the cooler things happen, and where some of the
problems occur. Should be cool. However, since I have taken on the obligation
of making this map larger than planned, it will take longer. I'll just have
to make sure that I spend some time on it every day after my normal day of
work. The last thing I want it to be is a collection of tons of rooms. I want
to capture the same feel of an 8+ player game on the smaller maps... but, of
course... have 100+ people on it. :) I definately look forward to seeing how
the user maps for Q2 handle the situation when it is available. You can bet
I'll be looking to see what works and what doesn't work and adjusting from
there.

Thanks to those people who own Ford Rangers that told me I was making the
right choice. I have yet to hear one bad thing about the Ranger... so I'm
sticking to it. There has to be something right when every single owner I 
have talked to has just raved about the truck. Yeah!!

Listened to "The Nightmare Before Christmas" soundtrack all day.

Went to see "I know what you did last summer". Not exactly the greatest
flick... but geez... who cares when you have girls like that as two of the
main characters. Kudos to whoever designed the outfits for the actresses!
I know, I'm a pig. Can't help it. :)

Wieder rolls on outta here...
