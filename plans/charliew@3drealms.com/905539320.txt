If you are intersted in Sin editing, scripting, whatever... then do
yourself a favor and check out "The Node":

http://www.ritualistic.com/node/

These guys are really on the ball and have done an incredible job in
documenting what they have learned from the demo. Heck, pretty soon
maybe I'll start swinging by there to look up stuff I need to
remember. ;) So if you wanna get a decent head start on learning
the functionality of Sin you should definitely check the page out.

We have all been pretty quiet about everything Sin related. For good
reason. Lots and lots and lots of things are coming together. Sometimes 
we forget there is anywhere else in the world but this office.

Do hotcakes really sell all that well? I've always wondered that.

Wieder rolls on outta here...
