Blair Witch Project, tonight, midnight, in a cool little independent/foreign film theater. I can hardly wait.

Everquest is so good it sucks, at least for people who have problems waking up in the morning. It probably feels cool to make a game that people have to stop playing because they like it so much.

Wieder thinks he should have been going with a girl to this movie, instead of a bunch of game developers...
