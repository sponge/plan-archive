Valentine's day is coming up. No Valentine... oh well, maybe sCary will be
my Valentine. I think giggler might already have him though.

I showed a demo of the GruberEngine to the coders here at Ritual. The Uber
guys are going back to the drawing board now after seeing the stuff I was
able to pump out in my spare time. BWAHAHAHAHA. Ummm... ok no. Just to clear
something up (mainly so I will stop getting emails regarding this)... Gruber
has nothing to do with Uber. I figured all you bright intelligent people of
the net would figure out that Gruber is just a parody of Uber. Especially
when I said it has 16 colors. :) But it IS real... just something I am
goofing off with in my spare time (when I'm not totally immersed in
re-reading Wheel of Time or playing through all of Age of Empires). Hobbies
are cool.

Duke Caribbean is out in stores. I was able to play through it with fresh
eyes and ummm... all I can say is what were we thinking? Aside from the final 
boss level and the rocky deathmatch level (only ones of mine I am happy with 
in the product) I was quite upset to see how it turned out. :( If you are 
wanting to play a Duke add-on with some fresh stuff to see check out Nuclear 
Winter. It isn't very polished, but has some very original and interesting 
stuff and worth the $15 you might pay for it. I still would love to see any 
reviews of Caribben, or if you have played it and have comments send them my 
way. Even if it is to say I'm a no talent bastard. :) But wait for Wanton
Destruction to play the airplane level before you call me that, hopefully
it will change your mind. ;)

Oh, and the new offices are cool. Patrick and I have enough room to play
baseball or football in our little corner. Of course, I would have to get him
away from Clan Arena. And that isn't gonna happen. :)

Wieder rolls on outta here..
