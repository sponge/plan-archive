Thanks for the b-day wishes... especially Blue's. I was starting to feel
old until I read that. ;)

Extention of the last update regarding what is more exciting in action
gaming... the killing or the surviving. Quite a few people sent stuff,
but for the most part it all boiled down to one thing: Revenge. Revenge
goes hand in hand with survival too.

If some scrub player is playing Thresh and happens to get one frag on him
right near the end of the match after getting slapped down like a child...
what is that person gonna do? Run around all day saying "Did you see that!!
Awwww yeah!!! Who's da man!" They still suck but they got that one lick of
revenge in there. I remember in Jedi Knight during one of the mountain
levels there was this door that just kept pumping out storm trooper after
storm trooper. That area pissed me off cause when I got there I had very
little health from my last saved game and had a nightmare trying to get
through there. But I survived the onslaught, which gave me thrills to no
end, and then went to find some health. I then went back to the area
and just kept cutting down storm trooper after storm trooper with the light
saber. It felt *soooooo* good. Not because I had been killing, I was doing
that the whole game. But going back to that point and just having this
constant stream of troopers to slash down to pay for all the pain they had
caused me. I can't wait until I meet an AI character that is smart enough
to taunt me with his moves and show me how much I suck. Cause it will feel
so good to shove it right back in his face once I figure him out. :)

Anyone out there been keeping up with the Diana Zamora murder trial? That
girl is one year younger than I and went to the same high school that I
did. I tell you, it is freaky to watch on national television someone walk
through a courtroom for murder, and thinking back to watching them walk down
the same halls carrying an armful of books and laughing with friends. Heck
I even talked to her on occasion. Just glad I didn't date her..............

My condolences to the families of the victims, as well as the families of the
Diane. I can't fathom how tough a situation like that is to go through.
Especially since the media is the only reason it is really getting much
attention. How many people go to trial weekly for murder, and they pick this
one case to make a national story out of? We can't live without the media,
but they sure make it hard to live when you are in their focus. Then again,
I guess in this situation I'm acting as the media. Damn. :(

Wieder rolls on outta here...
