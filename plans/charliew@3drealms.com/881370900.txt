Work Stuff
----------
Quick thing before I get started: Yes, I am working on a 100+ player DM map,
and am talking to people who write me to discuss the different implications
of this sort of game. Does this guarantee that SiN will have 100+ player
DM capability? No. I guess it was easy to assume that that was the case, and
I apologize for that. Since we are using the Q2 license, we are pretty much 
bound to what comes from id, and what we add to it after that. We have no 
idea if the 100+ player stuff will ever work, and I kinda just assumed that 
everyone who reads .plan files would know that. As far as we know 100+ player 
stuff isn't working yet. Anyways, to clarify... I'm working on this map... 
because it intrigues me and is something that is a lot of fun to work on while 
I wait for the time to start on the future projects. It is also nice to talk 
to the community about how to handle the situations... because I'm just as 
eager to try these things out as the next guy. :) And if the whole deal 
doesn't work out, then I'll just take the map and break it down into some 32 
and 16 player DM maps. Thus no lost time. Sorry to mislead anyone into 
thinking that anything was certain. Heck, we may even find out when/if Q2
gets the capability for 100+ games that it isn't any fun at all. We are all
flying by the seat of our pants until we actually just get to sit down and
play.

Some really good ideas have come up regarding handling the dynamic changing
of the map size. Some people have suggested really tall elevators that only
operate when a certain quota is met. The main problem with this is it will
limit the way you design the map. Right now mine is rather sprawling on the
x-y axis rather than a whole lot of z-axis changing. As the map comes 
together the z axis will be put more into play... but I don't really want
to break it all up to make long elevators.

Quite possibly the best solution for several reasons is the whole teleport
all players in no longer valid areas back into the valid playing field. You
re-enter the play with same health, ammo, etc that you had before. This has
been tried and proven in some of the QTeam mods which is why it is the most
attractive. Other suggestions have been playing a sound for a while saying
something to the effect that the area is closing, giving players time to get
out before they are locked in. But then what do you do with the players still
stuck in there who don't make it out? Another: simply make teleporters that go
from the valid play area to invalid play area no longer work giving players
still in the invalid area the chance to use teleporters to get back into the
valid field of play.

One of the cooler ideas I have heard so far is the concept of an entire
tournament in one map. Everyone connects (kinda like showing up to a track
meet) and does their event. You could setup the map to have Rocket Arena
areas, regular 1 on 1, Team Fortress, etc. The server could setup events where
people go in to compete in their respective division, etc. And something else
that would be cool for stuff like this would be the ability to hop around to
different games to see what is going on while you wait for your turn in your
"event". Obviously this is just one scenario... there are simply all KINDS of
things that could be setup. Imagine taking all the different Rocket Arena maps
that are popular and setting up an elimation tournament. As you win rounds
you move on to another arena to fight and move up in the rankings. If you die,
you could say drop back to the bottom and have to work your way up. If you
make it to the top you could stay there until you are defeated. Because things
might get lonely at the top... you could have people waiting their turn
challenge the champ just for fun so both can stay warmed up, etc. Might be
interesting.

Oh well, I'm really tired so most of this probably makes absolutely no sense.
