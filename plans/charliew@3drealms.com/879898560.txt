Well, first day home in Texas and I must tell you... it feels damn good
to be back in the Lone Star State.

Anyways, first off I have to give a big hello to my bud Lithium over at
http://sincity.stomped.com ... cause ... he rules the world.

So, let me tell you a bit about myself. I'm one of the newest members of
the Ritual crew, and my little contribution to the world is in level 
design. Now, since I consider the guys here at Ritual the best at what they
do... it is a huge honor to get asked to work here, and can't wait to toss
my two cents into the development machine.

I helped run a tournament in Fort Worth, TX way back when Duke was just
out called The Rodeo Shootout. Some of you might remember seeing banners for
that. :) That was the first thing I ever got paid to program or level design
for. Quite fun. Also, way way back when Duke first came out as shareware I
ran a rather large site called WiederWeb. Shut it down when it hit 100,000+
hits (which was simply a ton a little over a year  and a half ago for a fan 
page). I think the original Rodeo Shootout webpage is still up at:
http://www.cyberrodeo.com/duke ... There are some pictures and stuff there
that you might catch a glimpse of me in. :P Don't mind the HTML, it got all
wacked out over time.

Before coming here to Ritual, I worked for a small development company
based out of Indianapolis, Indiana called Sunstorm Interactive. I worked
on two projects under contract and then moved out there for just under
five months to work on two more projects. I did the contract work while I
was still a student at The University of Texas at Austin (Hook'em Horns!).
The stuff I did during this time was programming mostly for Duke It Out In
DC (Duke 3D Addon) and Cryptic Passage (Blood Addon). I also did the secret 
level for Duke DC, as well as one deathmatch map for Cryptic Passage. Once 
I moved to Indiana I began work on Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach and 
Wanton Destruction (Shadow Warrior Addon). I did both programming and level
design for those projects, but my main focus was on level design. For Duke
Caribbean I did about 60% of Market Melee, The Wavemistress, and The Alien
Remains (final boss level, and my favorite Duke map I have made to date). I
also did the four deathmatch maps. For Wanton Destruction I made the Airplane
level, and the final boss level that takes place on the rooftops of a Tokyo
skyline. The airplane level is my absolute favorite build engine map I have
made, and since I am completely done with Build, it will remain that way.
Although The Alien Remains in Duke Caribbean is a very very close second. 
The rooftops map has a pretty cool true 3D looking area in the final boss
room that was a lot of fun to make. I also did the three deathmatch maps as
well as the one capture the flag map. In addition to all those levels being
done in the short 4-5 months I was there I did a bit of webpage design and
was responsible for programming the DOS installers, launchers, etc for those
addons. I really had a lot of fun working on those projects, and if you are 
interested in Duke or Shadow Warrior I would highly suggest you check them 
out. The guys at Sunstorm have a ton of talent and I truly enjoyed working 
with them. I wish them all the luck in the world and definately look forward 
to what they put out in the future. Especially when Robert Travis makes the 
move over to the true 3D editing... wowsers! Check them out at:

Anyways, you're probably thinking to yourself "Gee Charlie, all that Build
design experience is great and all... but why in the hell are you at Ritual?"
Well, while I was doing that stuff, I knew I didn't feel comfortable in
Indiana, and thus started to look into getting back to my homeland Texas. So,
I picked up Quake mapping in my spare time and began making application maps.
Lithium sent one of my maps to Giggler... Giggler asked for more... I made
timebomb.bsp in response to the Ritual mapper search, and they liked what
they saw. So, I made another map to show them while I visited them here in
Dallas... and now I'm here. Now I get to be back in The Metroplex where I feel
at home and couldn't be happier. As I was driving back in I saw the Fort Worth
skyline and just shuddered. You probably think I'm crazy but it was almost
a spiritual experience... honest! :) Seriously though... things rule in Texas,
and I was nuts to think this state would ever let me leave. Plus, the girls
are just better looking in Texas. ;)

Well anyways, that's enough blabbing on and on. Plenty of time to say all the
stuff I forgot to say and such.

BTW - If you haven't heard of The Wheel of Time yet, go check it out at:

I got to see a bit of the growth of this project and it looks to be a winner.

Wieder rolls on outta here....
