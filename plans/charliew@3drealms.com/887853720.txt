No new SiNfo to talk about. Cool things happening though. I'm really starting
to get anxious for a new FPS to play. It is gonna be a lot of fun this
spring/summer for FPS players.

My truck became a man today. Big strong sweaty men moving tons of heavy
furniture. They were jumping in the back of the truck scarring up the bed
and just all around doing things that should be done to a truck.
Ok ok... so the big strong sweaty men were really giggler, sCary, Patrick
and I, and half the time we were complaining... but hey.

I bought "Jesus Christ Superstar" over the weekend. It is the 20th
Anniversary London Cast recording and I absolutely love it. I've been wanting
to grab it for a while. Now all I gotta get is all of Phantom and Evita.
Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber are simply brilliant. I'm still confused 
about something though... and maybe someone can enlighten me. Why did Webber 
choose to stop at the death and not tell of the resurrection? Whether you are 
a Christian or not... the resurrection is the single most important aspect 
that the final week of his life led up to.

Wieder rolls on outta here...
