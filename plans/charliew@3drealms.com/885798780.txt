This is a "what the hell am I still doing here at the offices?" update.
Thus nothing SiN or Ritual related. :)

Wow... the NFC domination of the Super Bowl is over. All I can say... is I'm
glad that A) it was John Elway to do it and B) it wasn't San Francisco that
lost it. The only way it could have been better is if it had been the Cowboys
in Green Bay's place. I'm a jerk... I admit it. :)

What a game though. Big congrats to Green Bay for being such a good team this
year.

Gruber Engine (not to be confused with the illustrious Uber Engine) has 16 
bit color... er... sorry... it has 16 color graphics. Oh yeah!!!

Wieder rolls on outta here...
