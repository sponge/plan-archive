Wow, talk about excitement. Around 3-4 am the neon sign in front of Dallas 
Alley (the building we are in) decided life wasn't worth it anymore and self 
combusted causing quite a nice fire display right below Harry Miller's office. 
Personally, I suspect foul play since the firemen had to come up to the second
floor and mess around in Harry's office. You never know what lengths other
game companies might go for some secret info. ;) 

But anyways... it was quite energizing for that time of the morning and I
decided to hang around outside on the curb watching them pretty much break
everything on the front facade of the building. Axes were flying and water
was soaking everything. They managed to rip open everything on the front of 
the building. Can't wait to see the Dallas Alley management's faces when they 
arrive this morning. :O

And hey... if yer in the Dallas area watch the news for it. The camera dudes
were around for a little while and I might have managed to sneak into a
couple of background shots. :)

Oh yeah... that Sin thing is going really well too. I see more Sin
deathmatching going on than any other (during free time no less!!) so
you always know that is a good sign. :)

Wieder rolls on outta here...
