Well, I beat No One Lives Forever last night. If you are looking for an FPS that is just downright fun run to the store when you can and buy it. Easily the best writing I've ever seen in an FPS game and the best voice acting to go along with it. Oh, and there is the matter of a game that is a lot of fun under all that.

The engine still seems pretty quirky but holy crap the game is just a lot of fun. Go go go!

"Warning: You are standing in H.A.R.M.'s way! Have a nice death! :)"

"How did this goat get in here?"

Thanks for the fun Monolith.

Think I've said the word "fun" enough yet?
