Wow, Sin is finally done and on it's way into all of your grubby little 
hands. :) I can't wait to see what everyone has to say when they see what 
Sin is really all about (nobody outside Ritual and Activision really knows). 
We surprised ourselves once we got the chance to take a step back and 
actually look at the game we created... so I know you are going to be very 
surprised as well. I especially can't wait to see what everyone does with the 
scripting and AI (they go hand in hand in many ways) in the future. If Sin 
doesn't give you all the options a mod author could want at this stage in 
technology, then I don't know what will. This is been absolutely the most 
fun, challenging, and rewarding year of my life. It's going to be hard to 
top it. I started off here pretty immature in many ways, and have done a lot
of growing up and learning since being here at Ritual and the things that have
happened while I was here. Hey, I'm only 21... I've gotta learn sometime. :D

On to other things. This will be my last .plan update from Ritual. I'm 
moving on to work at 3D Realms on Duke Nukem Forever. I'm extrememly excited 
about the chance to work on Duke because of my history with Duke 3D. I 
"grew up" on Duke from the days I was running fan pages, to my time working 
with Sunstorm on the Duke addons, to now. Duke is to me what Doom is to most 
of you. I learned everything I knew about level design before coming to 
Ritual from studying and ripping apart the levels in Duke and Shadow Warrior.
I've had an awesome time working with Richard Gray and now I will be working 
with Allen Blum, Stephen Cole, and Keith Schuler. Talk about pressure. ;)

For anyone who has speculations beyond working on Duke about why I am leaving, 
please provide me the courtesy to at least write and ask before you just 
assume something. Most likely you are wrong (just as the people who have 
written speculations already, have been). Writing wieder@ritual.com should 
reach me for a while.

I wish the best of luck to everyone on the Ritual team, and on FAKK 2. The 
FAKK 2 art team is simply mind bending. The stuff they have done at this 
point simply blows me away... I can't wait to see the final stuff. A thousand 
thanks to everyone at Ritual for giving me the chance to work on Sin and make 
a contribution. Looking back over the past year through the highs and lows 
(playing that first arena level with the real AI, the quantum destabilizer, 
that silly moving crosshair, Matthias and I practically living at TGI Friday's, 
Sinday... whew, finally moving into the new offices, AC... or lack thereof, 
and on and on). This has certainly been a wild ride. Be kind to "Christy" when 
I'm gone... she can only handle so many of you connected to her for so long. ;)

Wieder rolls on over to 3DR...
