SiN is rolling along. Right now we are all going through the maps and seeing
what all we like, don't like, would like to see, don't want to see, etc, etc.
Gets kinda heated sometimes but it's all for the best... trust me. :)
It's starting to look like a game I want to play, which is the best part.

On the less interesting side... my deathmatch map that I have been working
on for the past month just keeps morphing. The reason it has been going
for this long is I will make a new area for it... and realize it would be
cool to make a whole level in that feel so I just branch it off and turn it
into a new map. So, I've got quite a few new DM maps but am technically
still working on the same one. :)

"And now for something completely different..."

Logitech came by a while ago and tossed a lot of stuff our way. I think
pretty much everyone here is now using the Mouseman or the Roller Wheel
mice. Thanks guys!

I saw that Deer Hunter was #5 on the PC game best seller list. That is really
cool, especially since the guys at Sunstorm who worked on it were rushed
beyond what is normally allowed for human survival and sanity. A big congrats
to that part of the Sunstorm team.

Duke Caribbean will be out January 30th (one day after my 21st birthday...
cool!) and Wanton Destruction will be out February 15th. I know Duke and
Shadow Warrior are old and some of you out there seem to have this unnatural
hatred for the Build engine. But for the rest of you, if you happen to check
either of these addons out let me know what you think. And if you see any
reviews, please point me towards them.

If we happen to ever meet an alien species, and I am given the opportunity to
study one facet of their life to learn about their intelligence, etc... I know
exactly what I would study. The way they transport themselves as a public.
If you drive our roads you get a pretty good idea of what the human population
is like... and it's not that great. So I think looking at their transit system
would be good. I've been thinking about that since I drove 2000 miles to and
from Georgia and have just now gotten it off my chest so humor me please.

Seth Krieg has officially started up the WoT mailing list again and has even
sent out the first installment. So, if you are interested in getting news
about The Wheel of Time (the game by Legend Entertainment... not the books) 
then head on over to his site and contact him:

San Francisco lost to the Packers for the third year in a row. I think that
the one Packer fumble that wasn't called could have been the turning point
in the game... but no use crying over something that can't be changed. I'm 
depressed but as long as the Packers go in to the Super Bowl to provide the 
annual AFC spankdown... then I will be ok.

The Anastasia sound track rocks. Fox just knows how to do things right.
Even the jewel case book rules. Best one I have seen in a loong looong time.

Ok... that's enough babbling about nothing. Oh... except to say "I own you 
Brad Wernicke."

Wieder rolls on outta here...
