Just saw the preview of Age of Empires 2 on Next Generation. Excellent
looking, and the new economic concept sounds interesting. The thing I
preferred the most about Age was the feeling of building a thriving
civilization (well... up to 50 but hey) combined with the action of
a regular RTS. As long as the balance of that can stay true to the
original then I will be spending probably twice as much time in Age 2 as
I currently do in Age (which will be very bad for future Ritual 
titles... haha). One thing though... please work on the path finding,
Ensemble. That is the only problem I have with Age (and in an RTS that is a 
pretty major problem). I hate having to setup waypoints. But then again, 
maybe it is just me.

Hopefully Ensemble will get more credit for Age 2, it almost makes me want 
to puke to hear "Microsoft's Age of Empires".

Wieder rolls on outta here...
