This story that several of the news pages linked (I first read it off of Blue) is simply too much to handle. I normally try to avoid the subject except in certain controlled forums as it just leads to frustration for everyone. However, I'd encourage anyone here who actually cares about getting some sort of honest reporting about this industry and our games to write this editor and point out the glaring problems in the article: Kid killers linked to video games

I encourage and look forward to articles that discuss the violence issue with solid information and a good understanding of both sides of the issue. However an article like this simply has no place ever reaching any form of print.

Anyways, thanks to everyone who has signed up for the Duke group on SETI@Home, it will be fun to watch the group grow over time. If you aren't doing SETI, you should because it's cool to be a part of the biggest super computer that has ever existed! If you haven't put yourself on the Duke group, head on over and sign up!
