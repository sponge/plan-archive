Work Shhhtuff
-------------
I sit here with my hands in my lap eagerly awaiting Gary and Charlie to have
the tools ready with the UberEngine so I can begin toying with them. Can't
wait for that February 1st!!!
Meanwhile I keep fiddling with these curious creations called DM maps. Dunno
exactly what they are for but people seem to want them. *shrug*

Babbling
--------
The most unbelievable thing happened to me today when I went by Burger King
to get my food. The girl standing ahead of me in line actually happened to
recognize me from the press release photo, etc. Anyways, she kept looking at
me and finally said "You work for Ritual don't you?" Now, I'm thinking "Oh
yeah... she wants me... bwahaha". So I put on my best Tom Cruise smile and
say "Yeah, you play games?" <-- Standard computer geek greeting right?
She nods her head rather excitedly and says "So what is it like to really
work with The Levelord... and is Giggler really as cute as he looks in his
pictures?"

:)

:/

:(

Needless to say I was not quite on cloud 9 anymore. :)

On another personal note... the Gruber Engine has begun. Prepare yourself.

Wieder rolls on outta here...
