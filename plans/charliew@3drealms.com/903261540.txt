About two years ago I flamed a small startup company making a Quake
mission pack and told them that it was a shame so much talent was being
wasted on a bunch of jerks. I still think they are all a bunch of jerks,
but I love 'em all the same. I believe Hadwin still has that email. At
least he did when I came looking for a job at that very same company. :)

My how the time flies.

Wanted to echo Chris Johnson's message to Chris Day as he departs
3D Portal to take off for the wonderful land that is Austin and the
University of Texas campus. I'm just glad I convinced you to go there. :D
I'm incredibly jealous. Oh why couldn't Apogee have started in Austin,
thus sending the rest of the Dallas scene there too. Oh well.

Wieder rolls on outta here...
