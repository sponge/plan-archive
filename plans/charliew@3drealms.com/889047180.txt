Whoa!, Deer Hunter hit #1 for the month of January, even beating out the gods
of entertainment software: Riven and Q2. Even bigger mondo congrats to Jim 
Boer, Mike Root, and Nate Turpstra (if I keep congratulating them who knows 
where their egos might wind up... haha). Just goes to show how truly 
mainstream the average computer user is becoming. Now bring in the clones. *sigh*

The coders have been going at it adding all sorts of really fun things for us
to play with. The scripting is simply amazing and easy to use (once you spend
a small bit of time to get used to it) and all the new effects are top notch. 
If only we had another year to really really take advantage of it all. Then 
again, if we had another year the coders would add more stuff that we want to 
use more and the cycle would start all over again. Can't wait to see what user
mods people are able to dream up (especially using the scripting).

I bought "Chess" (rock opera with lyrics by Tim Rice) since I have always
liked "One Night in Bangkok". I was hoping more of the production would be
similar but unfortunately it wasn't. It was still good but just doesn't have
that same Webber musical effect. There are people who are good at what they do 
and then there are the masters, Webber and Rice are masters when together. I 
finally found Evita again so I'm getting closer to being complete. Just gotta 
get a hold of Phantom now... if only Borders would restock it!!!! :)

Today is my dad's 40 somethingth (is that a word? heh) birthday. That didn't
make ole Levelord feel too good. Don't worry Rich, in my mind you are still 
just a thirteen year old youngster. ;)

Wieder rolls on outta here...
