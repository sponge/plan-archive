Work Stuff
----------
I finally broke down and split the big DM map into two smaller DM maps. I
took the two basic themes and the main rooms that I liked the most and
created the two new maps. One map follows a flow much inspired by DM3 
(watching sCary and Patrick play Clan Arena all the time pushed me this 
direction) and the other is more akin to the scale of Jedi Knight. From 
listening to everyone talk, and in the emails I have gotten, just pure 100+ 
player DM doesn't seem to be what most people will want to play. Current 64 
player games of Q2 are crazy enough. I feel that the best application of the 
huge games will be in a tournament style setup, and in a fortress type 
situation with two armies attacking.

Everyday I wake up I am grateful to work with people as talented (and as cool)
as the dudes here at Ritual. Saw Richard and Robert picking on a poor helpless
box with a big black sword. I told them they were gonna put someone's eye out
and went on my merry way. I'm sure they stuck their tounges out at me as I
walked away. :P

Other Stuff
-----------
My truck rules. I won't tell you what sCary says about people who own trucks
though... it makes me blush. 
"Justice is served"

Just got back from watching Scream 2. I never saw the original (I simply
didn't understand why on earth anyone could think it was good) so I missed
out on a lot of inside jokes. But I tell you what, I am going to watch the
original now as soon as I get the chance. Scream 2 was absolutely the most
entertaining movie I have watched in a long time. The scene in the cop car
where they were crawling out was simply excellent. One part was really
cheezy... but I don't wanna give away anything. :) Go see it (not like you
weren't gonna go anyways) and if your parents say that you can't go... figure
out a way. ;)

Bought Monkey Island 3 finally and am dying to jump in. Lucas Arts has made
a killing off of me this year. XvT, Outlaws, Jedi Knight, Monkey Island 3, and
probably something else that I've forgotten. The thing is, I had a blast with
every one of those titles. Romero may want to make me his bitch, but Lucas 
Arts currently holds that title over me. :)

Wieder rolls on outta here...
