We released the tools to Sin earlier today (without too much hoopla or
fanfare). They let you do anything you want with Sin that is within the 
bounds of the demo (any weapons, monsters, blah blah blah). So go make 
some DM maps in the short time you have left before the full version of 
Sin is done and in your hands.

Go check out Ritualistic and The Node for places to grab them:

To top it all off, The Node is a great site to help you get started with 
Sin editing. The guys running The Node are great and have plenty of info
on editing for Sin. Start learning some scripting... I know eventually 
you guys will be able to do things with it that will boggle our minds. 

Maybe someone can recreate that "Danny The Robot" demo script we gave out
a while ago and get him working. You've got all the code and menus, you 
just need to create the map. :)

As for a status report on Sin... *big wide evil grin* 
"You ain't seen nuthin' yet... b-b-b-baby you just ain't seen nuthin yet..."
Did I mention it's too early in the morning? I'll stop now before someone
gets hurt.

Wieder rolls on outta here...
