Just wanted to say thanks to the guys at 3D Realms that welcomed me back to
Texas. I'm gonna have to take you up on that offer Matt. Oh... right back at 
you Joe. ;)

I'm starting to really get settled down and into things here. Learning a new
editor is never easy (I used Worldcraft 1.3 before coming here), but it is a
lot of fun. Especially when I have such fantastic art to use and examples 
to look at that the guys here have already done. Truly beautiful.

Remind me to get some headphones.

Wieder rolls on outta here...
