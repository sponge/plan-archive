I never said that Sin was going to be out on Oct. 13th. Someone
spoofed me on the Activision message board. Someone else took that
and a couple of other messages, combined them, sent them to news sites
as the truth. Later in that thread I let everyone know it wasn't me
(the spoofer couldn't even type "ritual" right in the email address)
but obviously someone didn't read the whole thread.

We are working hard to get this game out the door and into everyone's
hands... but we aren't releasing a date on when Sin is done. Besides,
why would a level designer tell the world about Sin's release on
a message board. ;)

Wieder rolls on outta here...
