Unreal looks beautiful... makes me even more excited to see what others
like Legend Entertainment do with their license of the engine (I can't
wait to check out Wheel of Time at E3).

On a similar note, I don't think *anyone* can claim that any one FPS game 
(or any genre for that matter) is the best ever without having played ALL 
the games that are out at that point. This is especially true when tossing 
console games into the mix.

Wieder rolls on outta here...
