Levelord mentioned that everyone decided to rot their minds with video games
at the Ritual BBQ instead of... uhh... well, whatever it is they did back in 
his day. :) Too bad it was getting past his bed time around 5:00 pm and he 
had to leave before we all left to do a little bit of minature golf out in
the fresh air. The weather has been so fantastic I don't know what to do with 
myself. I guess I'll just sit here and dream about being back at UT Austin 
watching all of the college women going to and fro.....

Much better! Of course, this is just the beginning. I'm already looking
forward to the 110 degree weather. Looks like the time has come to start
devoting precious time at the pool. Who knows, maybe displaying my drop dead
gorgeous bod will bring all the cute girls out of hiding. Ok, maybe not.
We level designers have such active imaginations... ;)

I finally found Phantom of the Opera, so my collection is complete for now.
I also broke down and bought the Titanic sountrack (now I can be just like
the other countless millions of people who bought it). But, to counter Titanic
I grabbed the Grosse Pointe Blank soundtrack. I loved the movie, and I enjoy 
the music just as much.

Books... As I wait for Robert Jordan to finish book 8 of The Wheel of Time I 
decided to start reading the series again. I'm already 1/3 of the way into 
book 2 again and loving every minute of it. It's almost like looking through 
a photo album reliving memories of past events in your life. That's how 
deeply Jordan's writing impacts you. Simply amazing....

Oh yeah, and as Matthias mentioned... the game (WoT) by Legend Entertainment 
is gonna rock your world. We both have been involved in that community before 
we came here to Ritual... so... uh... we know. :P You can also check out

Sin just keeps trucking along. Patrick and I spent quite a bit of time last
week just putting characters in the maps and watching them run around... while
we simply stared in amazement. The humans are so much fun to watch running, 
swimming, jumping, marching, shooting, etc. Blade and JC counter each other 
so well, I can't wait to see them going at it in deathmatch!

Matthias wore a shirt with my nickname on the back of it... I always knew he
wanted to be just like me. ;) haha

Wieder rolls on outta here...
