/me slaps himself in the head

How could I forget to mention this! I finished Book 7 of The Wheel of Time
by Robert Jordan last week. I tell you what, only one other author has been
able to captivate me as well as Robert Jordan has, and that is Arthur C.
Clarke (well, ok 3 if you include Gentry Lee with Clarke). Now, I'm just like
the other millions of WoT fans sitting here foaming at the mouth waiting for
Jordan to finish Book 8 so I can get my dosage of WoT. Now I can sort of
imagine what it must have been like in the old days when people had to wait
like a month just to get the next chapter for the book they were reading.

I finished the image editor for the GruberEngine. :) So now I can make
pretty pictures and such to use as the backgrounds, weapons, enemies,
etc. I've got the tools to create sounds from script files, but not sure if I
want to write something to make it easier to create and test the sounds.
The next step is to get the "rendering" engine up and running so I can walk
around in the world. Which means creating a level editor to make the world
with (probably the hardest part of the whole ordeal actually). 
Hobbies are so much cool. If you don't have one you are missing out on some
great self satisfaction.

One of the coolest things to think is "I made this! I didn't have to, but
I did it and it is all mine!" :)

Wieder rolls on outta here...
