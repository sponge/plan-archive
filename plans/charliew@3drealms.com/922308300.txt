No work/game info here, just more underage ramblings.

I finally got an account on Everquest active last night and ran around for an hour or so just exploring until my character got beat horribly by a snow orc or something and went to bed. I can't express how cool this game is. The first time I encountered the wooly mammoth was coming up over a hill and he was going directly towards me. Right as I hit the rise, so did he and just about scared me out of my chair. That's how immersed I was in the environment. Here's to hoping they get their network stuff stable soon.

Someone (I'll leave him nameless to protect the innocent) borrowed my Britney Spears CD today and opened a whole new world for me. There is a whole interactive thing on the disk, with the entire "Baby One More Time" video on it! I can't believe it's been sitting there on my desk for so long and I never knew what other treasures it held.

Combine that with Britney on the Rolling Stone cover and you've got one happy obsessed guy. ;)

Wieder goes back to hit that baby one more time...
