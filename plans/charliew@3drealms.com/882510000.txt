Work Stuff
----------
Not too much going on to report that would be interesting at all to you.
So, I'm gonna move on to the "Other Stuff" section and talk about stuff that
is not at all interesting to you. ;)

Other Stuff
-----------
Spent most of yesterday with absolutely the most wonderful woman on the face 
of this earth. I've known her since the 6th grade when I would pull her hair
in gym. A computer geek like me should never be allowed to associate with 
someone so beautiful... but we won't tell her that. :)

Taking off tomorrow to drive all the way to Georgia for Christmas. My little
5 year old brother has everything planned out for me during the time. Where
I'm gonna sleep, what I'm gonna see while I'm there, etc etc. I really miss
getting to see him every day. Now I just gotta teach him how to use a level
editor while I'm there! :)

Anyways, that's enough of me talking about stuff. I've got sleep to do before
I try to make that 1000 mile drive. :/

BTW, I hope you enjoyed watching sCary and Patrick spank me at Quake 2 in that
demo that was posted on the Shuga Shack. I'm getting better... honest! :)

Wieder rolls on outta here...
