Ok, I try to avoid talking about work related things here because... well I'm just a punk that way.

However this:

... is just about the most rEtArded thing I've read in a while.

"Oh look at us... we are EA and instead of simply adopting a packaging format which all our consumers are already familiar with, have plenty of facilities that are more than equipped to produce them extremely cheaply due to massive demand/bulk/etc... instead we will require a whole new design and come close but not *quite* to DVD case packaging because we are a unique and special snowflake. Let's pat ourselves on the back for being yet another small brick in the roadblock that stands in the way of getting our industry up to date!"

Which publisher is going to finally take that step? Is it really that scary? I'm so tired of us double packing our products and making a close to DVD sized box doesn't solve that. Why do we need a box for the outside and a case or slip or whateverthehellyouwannause inside. I'm still irritated Max Payne had to come in a full size box.

No, I don't wanna hear it anymore. Just go away... go play in the freeway... mommy has a headache.

Wieder sigh on outta here...

Oh yeah... and thanks to everyone who emailed me suggestions for the CD compilation. I haven't written back yet because I'm a lazy punk as well. I will though. They were all really good suggestions and will be putting them to use.
