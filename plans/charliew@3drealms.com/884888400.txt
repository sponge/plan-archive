Hey, thanks for all the input on what you thought about play on base100.
Most people really loved the map (kudos to Willits and co.). The general
opinion on play was that it was a cool thing for a while... but most people
are waiting for some sort of major change in gameplay for that many people
to really be fun. I still can't wait until we can simulate a true war type
situation from any of the wars in our history. Future wars can already be
simulated since most fighting is done from afar now.

I'm eagerly awaiting Gary and Charlie to get the UberEngine editor ready to
tinker with... as are all the other level designers here. The future is 
looking fun for the action gamer... lets party!

I finally found an 80's music collection that includes pretty much anything
an 80's freak would want. It's 6 cds and about 120 songs... but the damn thing
costs $120. I'm probably gonna bite the bullet and grab it though cause I'm
tired of buying a whole CD just for a couple of songs. There wasn't one song
out of all 120 listed that I didn't know or like. What I really want is some
sort of system where if I hear something on the radio I can push a button
and that *wham* I own that song and can listen to it whenever. Pay like 3
bucks for it or whatever and I'm happy. :)

Watched a lot of recordings of the "bad" press that Postal had gotten. Found
it completely entertaining and was actually slightly "envious" (to use
Richard's word). I'm still wondering when people are gonna wake up and stop
blaming everyone else for their problems/struggles/gripes with the world. 
I know I know... it'll probably never happen... but a guy can have hope 
can't he? One thing that I found really great was watching the news reporter
do an interview and hearing him say "Firebombing an entire marching band"
or "Mowing down rows of ostriches and hearing them scream in agony" without 
cracking a smile. I never could have done it, I've got a smile typing it. :)

Wieder rolls on outta here...
