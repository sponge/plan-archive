"Ahh, Christmas... that wonderful time of the year when families come
together in one place to remind themselves why they live so far apart in
the first place." <--- Not in my case but I thought this was funny. :)

Well, Christmas was fun. It was so great to see my mom, step dad, and
little bro again after a full year. Next year, I am flying though... no
more of this driving 1000 miles both ways. Especially after I got a
speeding ticket (76 in a 65, how lame is that!!! Glad he wasn't watching me 
in the 55 zone though!).

As I left Texas I noticed this really cute girl following me in a hot little
sports car (she liked the truck... had to be... haha) for a while, so I 
decided to test the waters. I sped up and started to pass people, and sure 
enough she stuck to me like glue. So I slowed down and ditto. Needless to say 
this was fun, and it was nice to have a partner on my long journey. :) But 
nothing lasts forever and she exited somewhere in Louisiana and I never saw 
her again. Ah well... tis better to have loved and lost than to never loved 
at all.

Ok, not really... but it was kinda cool when it happened. ;)

I found this store while I was in Georgia that was selling all kinds of old
stuff from the movies, so I started to check out the movie posters. I found
a totally awesome "Army of Darkness" original poster and "Lost Boys"
poster. There were so many things there that I wanted to grab but didn't have
a few hundred dollars to spend. *sigh*

Oh well, the only reason I updated was cause Maarten was bored and wanted to
update his page... so here. :) Enough random chatter. :P

Wieder rolls on outta here...
