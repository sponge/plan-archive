Ahhh, follow up to my comments about people griping about someone else's
success. I wasn't talking about something personal that happened with
me. I hardly consider myself a success yet. I have a nice job that I love,
sure, but I'm not a success........ yet. ;)

I was referring to the gripes about Planetquake recently, and even on a more 
common and larger scale, people who gripe about guys like Bill Gates, etc. 
Grow up and do something yourself if you really hate their success. 

Ugh, gotta get back into making updates about girls. :)

People who complain about someone else's success will never succeed 
themselves. Who cares how they got there. They are there and you aren't.
Trying to get there yourself is much to hard so you just gripe about it.

I've gotten some good questions about the scripting stuff. I'll be posting
some of the questions and their answers here soon, so watch for that if 
you are interested.

Wieder rolls on outta here...
