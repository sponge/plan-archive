Charlie's suck up .plan file today.

Big congrats to Ensemble for Age of Empires II. Being a big fan of the original, this was easily the game I was anticipating most that was to be released between summer and the end of the year. Everything that made the original as fun as it was is still there, everything that needed work was greatly improved. Combined with all the new stuff that works well makes me a happy Wanna-Be King. I still suck though so it's too hard, but it makes up for the Godlike bots in UT being too easy... har! ;)

Fight Club is a really fun movie, go check it out before everyone tells you how cool it is and thus spoiling the suprise.

Wieder rolls away from George and Keith trying to talk him into a fight and looks for a way to wrestle with Natalie...
