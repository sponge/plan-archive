Thanks for all the feedback related to 100+ player games and what you think
would be good for them. Most of what people have been writing about is how
to handle the situation where you don't have enough players to actually
fill the map, but still want to play the map. The idea that I had to solve
this, as well as most of the people who have written, is to setup a trigger
system that is dependent on how many people are in the map. So, you could
make a door open or close, or an entire wall disappear based on the number
of players. Of course, setting this up as a trigger system has lots of other
cool things that you could do, but you knew that. Someone told me that the
QTeam people had already done something similar in QC for CTF maps where if
the other team has no players the base is closed. So, it wouldn't be hard at
all to do this in SiN if it isn't already a capability in Q2.

Couple of things to think about though in a pure DM setup: What if the section
that I (or any other level designer) chooses to close off turns out to not be
the most fun part of the map for you and those playing with you. Lets face it, 
I don't think we will honestly be able to get 100 people to playtest the map 
before the product ships. It might happen... dunno. Anyways, it would be cool 
if there could be some sort system where everyone could vote on sections of 
the map when it resets. Then, as more people join it would open up adjacent 
sections.

Another possible problem... several people leave and the number of people has
now gone below the 32 (or 64, or whatever) player limit and the map shuts off
the desired section from play. What do you do with the other players that are
still in the shutoff section. You couldn't leave them to fight to the death,
because one person would still be left stuck in there, and forcing suicide is
never an option in my book. You might be able to teleport them to player start 
spots in the open area... but that seems kinda unfair since respawn kills are 
annoying. Or maybe make the walls/doors that close off be able to be passed 
through from the other side, so the player can make his way back into the 
main field of play.

Doing this type of map is turning out to be a lot more fun than I expected.
And I'm glad that people have given some feedback into how they think these
monster DM games will pan out. Of course, there are some people who think it
won't take off... and that is a definite possibility. But I think there will
be enough players out there (with more on the way) that a few maps will be
used frequently. There are plenty of Quake mods out there that don't get
played as much as Team Fortress, CTF, Rocket Arena, etc... but the people
who do play them would probably fight to the death if you tried to take it
away from them. :)

I gain more respect every day for people who design games that are intense, 
but have a deep enough plot(world? characters?) to care about what is going 
on. Today Joe and I were going over a certain portion of a design trying to 
figure out the best way to keep the action high, and yet still provide that 
good ole rise and fall feeling of a movie/book. Jedi Knight started to 
scratch the surface of this realm in FPS games, but I know it can go much 
farther. I hate waiting. :) Let me say though, there will always be a spot 
on my hard drive for an adrenaline pumping action game where the only motive 
is to kill kill kill.

Heh, I now know more about Ford Ranger engines and whatnot than I ever
expected. Thanks for the help... I'll definately be using it when I go out
to finally get the truck. Now if I could only find a ride...  :P

Wanted to listen to Paul Simon all day but coudln't find the one CD I was
looking for so I settled for Percy Grainger. If you know who Grainger is then
you are cool. As a Euphonium player in high school Grainger music was like 
heaven. The band versions of his music was just geared to let the Euphonium 
shine. Whee!!

I checked out Myth a little bit today. Enough to beat the first mission on
easy. I scewed up sooo bad and still beat the mission. Now that's a great
easy setting. :) Pretty darn cool. Age of Empires is still my favorite RTS,
but I think this one could jump up there pretty high if I ever take time away
from Team Fortress in my spare time to play it. I like how you start off
with only a certain number of people and fight from there. Cool slant on
things.
