Just a meer 3 more days until Duke Caribbean comes out. Prepare to see the
Dukester's legs ladies. If I'm not mistaken the legs from the original Duke
were none other than Levelord's. Too bad we didn't get him to pose for
Duke Caribbean. ;)

Ugh, the fumes from the construction on our new office space is causing
turmoil and unease in my stomach that I thought only women could cause.
But, just like with women, I'm sure the suffering will be worth it once
we are inside.

Oh my! That was tasteless... I apologize. ;)

Wieder rolls on outta here...
