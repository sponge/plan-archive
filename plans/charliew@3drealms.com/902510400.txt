To my wonderful roommate sCary...

"You can pick your friends, and you can pick your nose, but you can't
pick your friend's nose." -- It's the golden rule dude! 

It goes right along with "Thou shalt not kill" (unless the person is 
really really annoying) and "Thou shalt not commit adultry" (unless she 
is so hot that you have no choice), etc.

Now if I could just get Langsuyar to stop asking if he can pick my nose.
I think he's obsessed now.

A site that I found hit home pretty well and I had a good laugh with.
Some of you parent types might not find it so funny but, oh well.
Remember, I'm only 21. ;)

On to more relevent things pertaining to Sin. I kept forgetting to post a
couple of the more common scripting questions. Now that the demo has been
out for a little while and people are starting to delve into messing around
under the hood I'll finally post a couple of those questions.

Q) I'm wondering about how the parm. command seems to be used. I _think_ 
   it's being used to pass on reference variables for thread commands... 
   but I'm not totally sure.

A) That's exactly it. When you see a variable that has parm. before it
   that means it's being used to pass values from one thread into another.
   A parm. variable will exist in the game until there is a wait or a pause.
   It will then be cleared and you no longer have access to it. So it's a 
   good idea to convert your parm. variables into local.variables if you are 
   going to be using them much in the new thread.


Q) $object_two bind $object_one <-- How exactly does this affect the two
   objects in question?

A) What happens in that line is $object_two is now attatched to $object_one.
   Whenever $object_one moves $object_two will move right along with it. So
   if you were to make $object_one move up, $object_two would also. Same with
   rotation and anything else. $object_two can still move by itself without 
   affecting $object_one at all. This is how some of the more complex 
   movements are achieved in Sin (such as Danny the robot and the Macarena 
   robot shown at E3). Each body part is bound logically (fingers to forearm, 
   forearm to upper arm, upper arm to shoulder, shoulder to upper body, upper
   body to base, etc) and then moved in the way you would expect. If 
   $object_two were to get blocked so that it can no longer move, $object_one 
   would stop also. Ditto for the other way around.

Hope that clears up a little bit. Feel free to send in any other questions. 
I'll get to them as soon as I can.

Wieder rolls on outta here...
