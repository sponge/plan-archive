I wanted to take the opportunity to publically apologize to Joe Wilcox
of Simply Silly Software. I got into a public argument with him on IRC
that was both childish and unprofessional. I attacked him in public,
therefore I provide this apology in public.

Things are still rolling along on the Ritual front. I've spent the
weekend working on a deathmatch map that I'm pretty happy with. If you
ever played around in unfinished buildings as a kid then you will most 
likely like this one. I can almost smell the concrete and dust while 
walking around in it. :)

Pretty soon I will be moving on to my single player map. I'm definately
eager to get started on that. All these Deathmatch maps are cool, but
nothing is quite as satisfying as building a really cool single player 
map.

I'm definately looking forward to the next couple of days. Several of my
friends from UT Austin are coming up to visit their families, so I'll get
to see them too for a bit. Talking on ICQ from Indiana to Texas just isn't 
the same as sitting down face to face and goofing off together. ;)

It's a shame I don't have any cool stories to tell like Levelord. The toilet
never attacks me, I don't know any hypothetical Dicks with vans (uhhhh), and 
the sink just spouts water for me. Well, I could tell you about what it is 
like riding in the same car that sCary is driving... but I don't want to 
start a panic in the streets of downtown Dallas. ;)

That's about all that has been going on... maybe next time I update I'll have
something interesting to talk about. The life of a level designer just simply 
isn't that exciting when you put it to words. :)

Wieder rolls on outta here...
