Yeah I know, I left the "l" off the end of that URL in my most recent
update. Sorry about that.

Regarding the update yesterday about Deer Hunter, it was pointed out to me
that the Next Generation list is quite different than the PC Data list,
which is a more trusted list.

There Q2 comes in at 2nd and Deer Hunter at 9th. So again, big congrats to 
the Deer Hunter team for a job well done under such extremely tight and 
difficult conditions, and a congrats to the Q2 team for making a game
that is selling like wildfire. When I made the update, it was to congradulate
some friends... *not* a bash upon id, Activision, Quake 2, or whatever.
Had it said "Jedi Knight bagged by Deer Hunter" I would have said the same 
thing. And Jedi Knight is my absolute favorite action game available.

Quake 2 is a hit like everyone expected it to be, and nobody doubts that. 
Deer Hunter was a surprise hit and I'm happy for the guys. :)

Wieder rolls on outta here...
