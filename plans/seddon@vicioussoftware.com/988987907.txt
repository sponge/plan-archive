Project:
RAZOR, Xistence Engine (v2.5)
Plan:
GO LEAFS GO!

If your not into hockey, the Toronto Maple Leafs (my home town team) are
playing the New Jersey Devils (Yuck!)...

Now down to business. The Razor alpha-demo is coming along well, I have
set several meetings up with companies with regards to publishing Razor
and also to finally meet some masked code warriors/engineers I have been
talking to for years. The graphics look pretty cool and the
engine capabilities are extending more and more with each growing
hour...It's amazing what Caffeine and a deadline can do to you. =D

Game patent issues have been an interesting topic among the gaming
industry/mag's lately. People are "reinventing the wheel" by old
technology but snatching the patents to it even though it was already
common knowledge. I have a question for all you legal people who actually
read this plan, does a patent carry only under US law? Vicious Software
and I reside in Canada, copyrights are different in Canada so would we be
affected by these assinine patent peckers who try to cash in on the
hardworking programmers who develop games/technology?

PS. I am still looking for meetings from publishers, if you are
interested in publishing Razor email me to set up an E3 meeting.
