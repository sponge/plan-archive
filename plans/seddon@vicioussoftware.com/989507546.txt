Project:
RAZOR, Xistence Engine (v2.5)
Plan:
The Toronto Maple Leafs played a really crappy game last night, though it
was time for them to choke and lose the series against New Jersey. It's
amazing how loyal people in Toronto are to the Leafs considering they
haven't won the stanley cup in 30+ years.

Now to gaming news! Razor is coming along well. The e3-alpha will be
pretty cool. I am currently finishing the portal technology to speed
things up. I decided I needed the portals in the E3 alpha considering I
hit a nice 5 fps on a crusty old Riva TNT. I am developing the game engine
around the TNT/G400 to keep performance high on the slower cards in the
market. Anything below a TNT and well, goodluck! If any IHV's are willing 
to donate more sophisticated cards to Vicious Software for Developing our 
games, we will certainly put credit on our website and in the games. I
added Environment mapping few days ago which hits the fps, however it adds
some really stunning effects to the game! Carona's were also added a
few days ago, they look nice but are rather slow in spots. I added
colourization to them so the mappers can change their colour which is
kinda nifty. 

E3 is gonna rock! I have several meetings booked with publishers
regarding Razor. I had another publisher contact me yesterday about 
Razor so things are looking good. As always pictures will be up soon 
on the Vicious Software website. If anyone reading this can sneak me into
any parties at E3, I'll give them some VS propoganda!
