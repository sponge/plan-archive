Project:
RAZOR: A Sadness That Can't Be Silenced, Xistence 2.5 Engine
Plan:

The VS site has been updated with a nice new "face-lift". The events is
still bare same as the Razor section however those will be finished
soon. Just needed a change from the other older layout. Razor is coming
along at a great speed now that the map editor is in a nice stable
condition. Eye-candy and other nifty effects are being put into the editor
right now to add more sophisticated effects. Hopefully we'll have some
screeeners soon, in the meantime in the technology section there are the
"prelim" pictures of the first level of Razor. I got my E3 pass today in
the mail, I LOVE E3! Two other members of VS also got them, just waiting
for the last to arrive. 

On a closing note, if any companies are having parties @ E3-2k1, give me
an email if you have room the lists so I and the rest of the crew can get
in.
