Things going good at the VS front. I did the finalization of the server
stuff. Damned windows kept freezing the server, goodbye windows, hello
linux! Much easier for configuration, installation, and drum roll please I
don't have to spend a gazillion dollers on licenses for software I may use
once. 

If your bored outa your mind folks, head over to your local gaming store
and pickup alice, it's phat. American McGee knows his shit, and it's just
like another id Software title, hard to imagine he's at Ea now. =D

Hopefully if time permits I will post some screeners on the site, and dare
I say it, update the site.
