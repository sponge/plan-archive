Project:
RAZOR, Xistence Engine (v2.5)
Plan:

I saw Army of Darkness for the first time on the weekend, and oh my god I
feel like I was living in a hole! I haven't laughed so hard in a long
time...It just goes to show you, behind the programming geek there is a
brute-force maniac wanting to escape...=D

Switching to dev talk for a minute, Razor is coming along at a nice
speed. We will be will passing out alpha-demos at E3 to potential
publishers, friendly game companies, and IHV's. A publicly released
multiplayer demo will appear on the net several weeks later, if we are on
time.

After long examination of different lighting techniques, I opted for a
cheaper lightmap painter system. I originally tried Radiosity lighting
however I abandoned it after the compilation times were too damn
long. I wrote a console app to do the calculations only to find that a
visual representation was required to ensure the damn thing was 
actually calculating the correct formula's, and bouncing properly. I then
tried several other types of lighting, though I was most impressed with
the lightmap painting method. For making maps and customization it is fast
and elaborate. I won't go into details right now, but it looks cool. =D

The Vicious Software website will have some pictures of RAZOR soon, and
yes I do mean soon! E3 is quickly approaching and the VS team are getting 
excited. Now it's time for a shameless plug, if you or your company are
having E3 parties, the VS team would like to go so give me an
email so I can get the details.
