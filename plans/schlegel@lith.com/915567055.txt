The Last Plan Update

Well, I'm out of here.  Today is my last day here at Monolith.  I will be venturing off to greener pastures at Cavedog.  It has been fun the past few years here at Monolith and I am glad to have been in on the Blood 2 action.  Hope you enjoyed the past plan file rants but as of today, they are silenced.  Have fun kids! Later...
