Go get Forsaken. Install it. Play it. If you even remotely enjoyed 
Descent/Descent II, this game will blow you away. It's got better mouse 
handling (i.e. the sensitvity settings actually seem to do some good) and 
the graphics/effects are simply unbelievable. The idea is the same of 
course (fly around and shoot things), but isn't that what we all have 
grown to love?

I played it multiplayer yesterday and it is a blast. If you're at all into
eye candy for a computer game, you will drool over this for a long time. 
Oh, the amazing things you can do with hardware acceleration.
