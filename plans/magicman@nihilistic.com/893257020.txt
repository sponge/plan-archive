"At least we know that Rogue has at least one good deathmatcher now."

Redwood...shame on you...I just may have to make you eat those words very 
soon...heh. Plus...zor? A good deathmatcher? Boy, standards sure are
dropping off the charts...

In other news...

Deathmatching with cool new weapons and effects is a very very cool thing.
I'm anxiously looking forward to playing our Quake2 mission pack when it's 
done. Everything is coming along nicely...

In other other news...

Redwood's Rumor Mill...err...Redwood's 3D News had a small post about me 
leaving Rogue. Redwood knows his stuff...my last day at Rogue is approaching
quickly. I will be joining the rest of the crew at Nihilistic early in May.
I've had the best time working with this psychotic...err...friendly bunch
here. But, I can't wait to get started building a new company and making a
big impression in the game industry.
