=====================================================================

9/18/2000

Nihilistic Software (especially the Level Design team) would like to 
welcome our newest employee, Carson Utz. 

His pure level construction skill, eye for detail, and passion for 
gameplay design make him a great fit to help fill out our team.

He helped out in several areas during the development of Prince of 
Persia 3D (http://www.princeofpersia3d.com/main.html), including 
game design, level design, texture art, and writing.

Those of you in the Quake community will know him from his Quake2 and 
Quake3 "riscchip" levels (http://www.riscchip.com/):

Quake2:

What the End is For - http://www.riscchip.com/risc1.zip
The Widening Gyre - http://www.riscchip.com/risc2.zip
Inferiority Complex - http://www.riscchip.com/riscdm1.zip

Quake3:

The Ring of Bone - http://www.riscchip.com/riscq3dm1.zip
The New Flesh - http://www.riscchip.com/riscq3dm2.zip
Big Tobacco - http://www.riscchip.com/riscq3dm3.zip
Smear Campaign - http://www.riscchip.com/riscq3ctf1.zip

We're thrilled to have Carson join our team and help us take
Nihilistic's next project in the direction we want it to go.

Welcome aboard Carson!
