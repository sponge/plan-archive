Hey guys! Privet! Kak dela? 
Sorry for the lack of gaming updates, been busy lately.
Trying to find a car, any recommendations out there? oh one thing, I can't get a expensive car like John, so don't recommend a Hummer or a Ferrari J
Btw, Seneca, Rooster & Joey are in Japan right now, getting me some cool stickers & toys!
Seneca is probably playing, AM2's latest "Spike Out" 
The game looks incredible, go here for some screenshots!

Dreamcast is getting a lot of hype in Japan and in US, even though it won't come out here for almost a year, that's why I'm getting a japanese Dreamcast when it's released this fall.
Check out this page for daily updates on Dreamcast development, I'm can't wait for it!

Soul Caliber, next big game from Tekken3 team, Soul Caliber a sequel to "Soul Edge" (arcade), "Soul Blade" (psx), I highly recommend downloading some of the katas, Kilik especially, movies shows off at 30 fps, the game is 60 fps btw, some of the characters katas, (set of martial arts moves), it has the best character animation ever, motion capture at it's best!
You can get them directly from here,

Going to school some people in Tekken 3, with Nina. (you gotta love those reversals)
I'll update later on perhaps, Daikatana is doing great btw, Jim Daly (who conceptualized the game) is having a blast with his ION Blaster J
Anyway take care, and in Russian Dosvedanie!

Now after a long long day of work is finally over, I'm bored.

E3 was a blast, met Shigeru Miyamoto the Grandfather of video games, after that I didn't 
care about anything, meeting Shigeru was one of my greatest dreams come true, I'm happy!
Need to go eat a mushroom now, and travel through a green pipe!
I got his sig, I scanned it and e-mailed it to my buddies over at www.ign64.com

Saw some kick ass games, for me the game of the show was Zelda: The Ocarina of Time.
It's everything I expected to see/hear and feel.
Banjo-Kazooie comes out the 29th of June.
Banjo-Kazooie is extremely cute, but none of that matters because 
the gameplay also happens to be excellent, and possibly even an improvement on Super Mario 64. 
The worlds in Banjo-Kazooie surpass any other 3D platformer on the market in terms of 
texture detail, creative level design and replayability. And the characters, which have 
been described as unbearably cute, are so well-crafted that player's will find themselves 
enjoying the tasks and objectives set forth by enemies and allies alike. Rare has proved 
once again that it can keep pace with Nintendo's in-house developments. 

Check out www.rareware.com, great new site.

Stay AWAY from Quest64, THQ did a pretty poor job with the game.
The game seemed very rushed, and it's not coming out untill fall in Japan, they want to fix 
certain things.
Rent if first.
MK4 comes out tommorow in Blockbuster! Midway is doing the same Rare did with Diddy Kong 
Racing, play get excited and then buy, MK4 is great, met John Tobias at e3, I'm a huge fan 
of MK series.
Alright have a nice weekend dudes & girls, I know I will if you know what I mean :)
