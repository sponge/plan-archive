<p>This friday (the 13th) will be my last day as an employee of Dynamix.&nbsp; It has been
a GREAT 9 years here in Eugene and I will always look back on these years fondly.
&nbsp; The decision to leave was very difficult for me to make but I have an opportunity
in the bay area that I cannot pass up.&nbsp; I will be joining Electronic Arts in their
Online Games division as a lead designer on an upcoming multiplayer title.&nbsp; Tribes 2
is progressing very nicely and it with great sadness that I will not be able to help
finish it.&nbsp; I still plan on being an active member in the Tribes community (playing
for Western Alliance)... see you online.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Scott</p>

<p>p.s.&nbsp; You CAN buy Mirror Pond Pale Ale in the bay area... woo woo!</p>
