Ok, there is a beta patch out that has the new mission editor in it.  All of you mission builders out there give it a good pounding and let us know if you find any problems with it.
If you do find a problem please send me mail asap and we will try to get it addressed before we release the 1.4 version.
<br>
On the new Mission front:  The original Broadside is BACK!  The 1.3 version has been renamed to BLASTSIDE (Thanks to everyone who submitted a name.)
</P>

A big thanks to everyone who stopped by at Extreme Annihilation.  Also a congratulations to the Wu-Tang guys for pulling
out the victory in the Tribes 4-on-4 tournament.  They also managed to spank a drunken dev team to win their very own voodoo 2 
boards.  We will be updating the tribesplayers web site with pictures from the event when we all return from GDC on Monday.
<br>
<br>
Also, if you are planning on attending GDC feel free to stop by and check out the SUAV.  It's nifty.

I expect to be almost the final standings:</p>
<p>

So, with about a 2-1 margain the old Broadside version will be put back for the next 
patch release.  I will re-release the latest version of broadside as well for those 
people that requested it remain as a different named map.  Ok!  Now time for a contest:</P>
<p>

<p>
Send me your best name for the new map... </p>
<p>
The winner will get their name included with the new map description.  Here is your chance
to be immortalized and get your 15 seconds of fame.</p>

Woo Woo!  We got Beer!  After months of pleading for beer to arrive in 
the mail we've finally got some!  A special Thanks to DR Jeep, Qui9 and the public
beta team.  DR Jeep sent us some $$$ so we could buy some good local brews, 
Qui9 and the public beta team actually sent us a boatload of Rogue ale brews.</p>

<p>
THANKS!</p>
