The response I received from people on my request for feedback was great!
Thanks for taking the time to send in your comments, they will help us
shape future patches and even our feature list for Tribes 2.  Your 
comments are greatly appreciated.

If you have any additional comments feel free to send them to me at:

scott.youngblood@dynamix.com

P.S. I know many people really really want the OpenGL update NOW!  Don't 
worry, we're working on it... as soon as we have a version that is ready
to be pounded on we will let you have it.

Also, if you have any specific mission criticisms or ideas let me know 
and I may be able to fix them for the next patch release.  I've already
tweaked many of the missions that had play balance problems, but I would
like to hear what you have to say.

Scott
