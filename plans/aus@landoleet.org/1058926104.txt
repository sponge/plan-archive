Hey, it's Valentines day. So while everyone is doing 
cheesy shit and give out hallmark cards and teddy 
bears with hearts on them (UGH!), I'd like to take 
the time to thank somebody pretty special in mah life
and stuff.

....

I'm telling her later, not in my .plan, you nerds.

Happy Holidays and stuff! I'm happy but I swear, if I
hear another bad remix of a traditional christmas song
I will be buying a rather large gun AND YOU PUNKS THAT
MAKE THAT CRAP BETTER RUN.
