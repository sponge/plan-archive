So here I am, I just wake up and I'm trying to wake up
and look who decides to make me feel guilty about
getting to the office so late since it's my second day,
yeah, you guessed it, JON. JON JON JON. ALWAYS JON!

Though it was mostly fun, we did decide to always keep
a blunt object in reach to take care of Jon. Just 
'cause we love him... 

Also, Steve's dedication about this shoe thing was 
great, just fucking amazingly great. You rock dood.
