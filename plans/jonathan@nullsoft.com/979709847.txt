Episode I: And how can this be?  For it is a new .plan!

That's right.  A new .plan for a new millenium.  I make no promisses other than
many spelling errors and a few typos.  Such is the way of things.

It has only been a scant 4 months since I last visited these pages but so much has
happened.  I now have my very own SHOUTcast station, Chez Whitey.  You can listen
at http://scastsrv4.shoutcast.com:8014/listen.pls but be sure to have a martini in
your hand when you do so.

I have also put together a web site to help celebrate the station and to house the
pics I have taken.  Goto www.realsuave.com

I now have dsl.  That means that I am in training for quake matches again.  If you 
see Mr. Sparkle in the arena stop give me a shout.

WORK RELATED:  Yes, it is what you are all here for right?  So here goes....

I have just been given the approval to go to Sundance/Lapdance.  I will be taking 
my editorial/writer skillz on the road and you will be able to see it all when I get
back.  I promise to do a write-up for the front page of winamp.com.  Maybe even a few
movie reviews for realsuave.com

Looks like an alpha for wa3 is just a few weeks away.  We have finally been given the
go ahead for release and the boys are breaking the whips on the llamas asses to get
this one in shape.  Could a full release be far behind?

Steve continues with the revamp of the site.  Good stuff. I can't wait.

Ummmm.  that is enough for now.
