Helluva week here.  All kinds of weird shit trying to get the site live but we are on the
cusp.  Happy times.  

Going to have something special on Chez Whitey mid-month.  The supreme lounge singer/comic
Richard Cheese has agreed to let us have a Listening party with his music along with a
simultaneous chat in the Chez Whitey lounge on http://www.chatini.com

I am turning 30 this month.  Woooohooooo!!!!!!!!  Can't decide what I should do to make the
day special.  Feel free to email me with suggestions or just drop me a b-day hello.

Ninja month is winding down.  So sad.  The whole crew kicked a lot of ass in getting
the whole thing together.  What can we do next?  hmmmmm.........

Just started a new SHOUTcast station called Love Buzz.  An homage to my old college days.
Check it out:  <a href="http://lsac1-0-s02.shoutcast.net:8002/listen.pls">LOVE BUZZ</a>

Much love.  AIM me with requests for either station.
