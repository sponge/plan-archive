Welp, as everybodies seen we've finally gotten our first product out on the
shelves (yeah team ;).  It was definately a ride while making it.  I think
we've all come a very long way from where we were when we started.  Many
thanks go to all of the Ritual tribe for giving us the chance and the
means, you guys all rock, and we're looking forward to what you guys are
up to next ;).  Also many thanks go out to Activision for their help and
support :).

One thing to keep in mind when playing through Wages of SiN, we've stuck
quite a few little funny 'Easter Egg' type things all throughout the
game.  Several of them involve events that spawn multiple levels.  So just
something fun to keep in mind while going through the game ;)p.

Hehehe, well, my congrats go out to Paradox over there at Ritual, I guess
the dumb finally caught up with ya in the end there eh? ;)p

Well, we're all in wrap-up mode now.  Just cleaning up the game flow
and tweaking speed issues, making the levels faster as best we can.  We're
still also on da bug hunt and scratchin' out as many as we can.  I think
we've gotten now something like over 512 killed, and aren't findin' too
many more now that are pure code related and not just level-flow scripting
errors.  We've been getting good feed-back from the beta testers (both in-
house and Activision and now Ritual as well) and implementing those
changes.  So I think we should be very solid when it hits the shelves
(which should be pretty soon now).

I'm working on the intro cinematic to the game currently, and we've
planned out some pretty kewl shots for an in-game cinematic that I hope
people will dig.  I might end up having to cut it short though due to time
limitations, but it'll still be good :).

We've also got our boss fights pretty much done as Carl said, but I think
we're going to have to tone one of them down a bit considering one comment
we got was "he was really tough, even in God mode" ;)p.  So it should be
a satisfying fight for anyone with a nice bloodthursty mentality :).

Also, one of the "perks" of this job was coming out to warmer weather, but
I took a look out the window this morning, and there was SNOW!!! Damn it!
I got enough of that in Chicago, I don't want anymore!!  I think I'm going
to have to put Mother Nature on my grudge / assassination list if this
keeps up ;)p.

One more side note, for anybody who likes good techno / electronica style
music, check out Junkie XL.  They're like a more energetic Prodigy, mixed
with a little Rage Against the Machine style vocals at times.  They're
music is really killer, and groovin' to listen to.

Well, we're just a few days away from our offical Beta, and it seems that
we're lookin' pretty solid from what we can tell.  We've squashed several
hard-to-repeat crash bugs from the original SiN code (as well as quite a
few we induced ourselves :).  So the code is getting there as far a
solidity, it's pretty much now just play, game flow, and tweaking issues.

On an editing note for SiN LD's out there, just thought to warn you about
a certain "sudden death" scenario that you might come across.  Sometimes
when you try to load your map, the game might just quit back to windows
with no error message, just BOOM!!!  Of course, the first time we got that
here we freaked :).  But it turns out that just about everytime this
happens it's an error in the level script file associated with it.  So far
it seems to either be an extra set of double-quotes (usually because of
a layout string that was missing the closing set at the end).  Or because
there's no end statement at the end of the file.  The only other time I 
had this happend was when I exceeded the in-level entity count (I can't
recall how many times I've broken this damn engine now on this project :).
You're only allowed 1024 entities in the map at any given time, but you
can have more in there when you're designing the map of course.  But
certain entities in the map file don't get included in that in-level entity
count (like info_pathnodes, and func_removes).  If yer wondering why I had
more than 1024 entities in there, it' because I'm crazy and trying to
do some crazy crap, like a fully destroyable 3 shelf shelving unit that
would destroy differently depending upon where you hit it :).  The entire
unit consisted of 16 entities (not including stuff to put on it :).  That
and the fact that I had 7 of them in the map.  So they had to go bye-bye,
but I left the code in the script file for anyone who'd want to screw with
it (although I didn't get it fully bug-free because I had to stop using
them).

On a side note, I think Zied is looking for his next state to violate.
I see him looking at that pacific coast area quite a bit, so be prepared
for the next bombarment of bad grammer from the Supposed Former English
Major Junkie ;)p

Hey all out there in wonder full electron land (and to anybody else who
actually reads these things :).  We're lookin' for some in-house beta
testers here in the Tulsa / Dallas area(if yer willing to drive up for a
day).  Of course we can't pay ya (but we have Moutain Dew for you :).
Also, a prerequisite is that you had to have played through the original
game of SiN.  So if if yer interested, please email our boss-man Tom at
tomk@2015.com

Everything's coming together, and we're really close to being finished.
Still squashing a few bugs here and there, and we want to do our best to
make sure that all of them get squashed :).

On a side note, don't fret over Z's wonderful grammer, we have to live
with that.

OK, I'm warning anybody now that this update is mostly personal and
will have very little about the add-on pak, so either skip to the end if
ya wanna find some info about the pak.  There, warning said, now my gripe.

This whole incident with the President is proving one thing that I've
been saying all along, my entire life soo far.  We (the people) do not run
this country, the damn greedy ass politicians do.  We're SUPPOSED to be
running this country, ya know, of the people, by the people, for the
people.  But no, we don't.  Now here's the proof of that, and also I'm not
letting my political views influence me here, I say impeach the guy, but
again, that has nothing to do with what I'm about to say.  We elect
representatives to represent us, and our views in government, to make sure
that they are given their proper voice.  Well, from what I've been
hearing the majority of the country is saying not to impeach the president
and here the house has voted to impeach him.  Umm, what's the deal?  The
public said not to, and they voted to anyways?  Ken said on the way in to
work today he heard a representative say on the radio that he was elected
to "vote his consience".  Bull shit, you were elected to vote what the
public you're representing wants you to vote.  I mean when, as a public,
are we going to realize that we've been getting the big screw here?  It's
all down to votes, power, and money.  Don't mind what the public has to
say, we're above them.  

Anyways, enough of my ramblings.  It just drives me damn crazy seeing
things like this, when it's not fair, or right.

Well carl's been working on one of our Bosses, and he's pretty bad-
ass right now.  I think you guys will dig it when ya fight him (or hate us
for him ;)p.  He's interacting with the environment and using it to help
kill you :).

I'm outta here-------

My gosh, what the hell am I doing up still??  Trying to finish these damn
levels as per the norm :).

I just saw that we released some screenshots to Sharky's Extreme (even we
here don't know everything that happens all the time ;), and I saw that
it still says under the "Name of Add-On:" section, unknown.  Well the name
that as far as I know is official is Wages of SiN.  I guess in all of our
running around we've forgotten to mention that (silly us :).

On a side note, saw Star Trek: Insurrection tonight (well, yesterday
really).  It was good, I really liked it.  It was basically a 2 hour long
really good STTNG episode.  There's also a lot of good humor in this one
as well, a lot of funny parts.  So if yer a trek fan, go check it out,
you'll probably dig it.

Ooo, one other side note, I saw a link to an article from Blues News 
regarding The Grape (I think that's what his nick is) on reoccurring locals
in games now-a-days.  The point it brings up is definately true, in the 
end it's the fun and content that count.  One thing though to also keep in
mind as to why these locals are picked, is also when you have a storyline
that you have to progress and stick to, you try to pick levels that fit in
with that storyline as well as be cool locations to place levels.
Unfortunately, the locals he's saying are the most used soo far happen to
be fairly generic enough where they're cool locals, and they can fit into
a lot of different storylines that are considered to be realistic style
locals.  Obviously if all of a sudden in Half-Life, you go into a museum
while going through this hidden secret military base, that would be 
extremely out of place and would probably hinder the story development of
the game.  Just something else to think about why certain locals are
picked.  Also, just my 2 cents :).

Whelp, again, enough of my chatter...........

Well, I've tried getting a picture of Paul to send to Blues, bastard keeps
eluding me, so I'm going to have to resort to more drastic measures >:)

Man, the AI scripting in SiN is a real blessing, and a curse (and all in
one nice package :).  There's a lot of powerful things you can do with the
AI, but the problem is learning the tricks of how to write the script
files so that the AI will do those powerful things the way you want them
to.  I dunno if some people in the editting community have had a chance
to play with it yet.  It's way beyond Quake / Quake2 AI in the respects
that you place a monster and it goes on it's own programming.  You can do
that to an extent, but the level designer has to give it the brains to
behaive more intelligently.  First, the LD has to place these wonderful
little red dots all over the .map file called pathnodes (looks like yer
map caught the measles in the editor :).  They tell the AI where they can
go, duck, cover, or jump.  It may seem like "well hey, that's not real AI
then!"  But it's really intuitive in the fact that the level designer
knows where the best places for cover are, and where are the best places to
duck, or where to jump from one point to another.  So it only makes sense
to have the LD just "tell" the AI where these places are.

After ya do that, then there's the scripting (that's where the fun / hell
starts :).  It's really easy to get a guy to just follow a path around to
have him patrol an area.  But it's more complicated to have it so that
say in a group of three guys, when one spots you, they all "wake-up",
and two start to attack, and one goes and runs for back-up.  But once you
learn the proper way to code it so that the engine likes it, it starts to 
get easier.  Plus we've added some new tricks to our guys so they do some
funky stuff when attacking you :).

Well, again, more of my drivel that you're now probably really boared with
so on that note.......

Welcome to my lil' cubby hole of internet space.  And for those of you that
aren't my personal friends that happened to stumble upon this, my 
appologies ;).

Well we got these little .plan files finally working, so I thought
I'd update mine with some totally irrelevant information (well, maybe just
a little bit of relevant stuff :).

But first, to my wonderful co-worker Paul (a.k.a. Talon).  If ever 
anything were to happen to Yanni, I swear you could take his place.  I 
mean I should really send a picture over to bluesnews so he can do a
seperated at birth between you two, it's scary.

Well the add-on pack has been under major development here since March of
this year, and now it's mostly down to adding all the fun game-play
elements to the levels.  Unfortunately, that's the most time-consuming
part of the process :(.  Our schedule's been hell from day one, so we've
been pretty much working our butts off to get this thing wrapped up.
There's a lot of goodies and new toys and elements that I really hope
people will dig and have fun with, cause in the end, that's what it's all
about :).

On a side note, for anybody out there who's a Rush fan, I highly recommend
the new live album: Different Stages.  It's an excellent live album, and
the other really cool thing is that 15 of the 22 songs were recorded 
from the show at The World Music theater in Chicago, and I was there at 
that show :)  These guys every time I've seen them always do it right, and
give nothing but their best, I think this live album really captured that.

But anyways, I think I've bored you enough with my drivel, so until 
next time.........
