Today is my last day at Monolith. Although I am very excited about my new position at Surreal Software, it's hard to leave behind the place and people that have been so great the last year and a half. Lith has been a exciting place to work, and I've had an awesome experience here. I want everyone to know that Shogo is very close to completion (and is looking really really good!) and so my departure shouldn't impact the release date at all. I wish the very best to everyone at Lith and hope only good things continue to come your way in the future.

SHOGO! Yep, the game formerly known as RIOT: Mobile Armor has changed to SHOGO: Mobile Armor Division. I gotta say I love the new name, love the new website, and love the whole direction the game is going in general. Shogo is anime. Anime is good. If you haven't checked out the new site (www.shogo-mad.com), do it NOW! It's got a new AVI that completely rocks, new art, and a ton of new screen shots.

The team is entering the "vortex" stage, where everything is just coming together faster and faster, ultimately funneling into a pinpoint known as a gold master of the game. It's exciting to see the enthusiasm and dedication that everyone is displaying, and it is really starting to show in the game. On the level side, it's all about getting the levels finished for beta, which is approaching quickly. We're right on track, and the 14 hour days for the next 2 months will make them that much better. You guys won't be disappointed. Check out the new screen shots, and the AVI on the page, and you'll see what I mean.

p.s. must be a lotta H freaks out there. At last check, "more nudity" was winning the poll on the new site. ^_^
