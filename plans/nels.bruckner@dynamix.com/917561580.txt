     Putting the finishing touches on the patch...
NOT the OpenGL patch.  That comes next.

     Just got all the GameSpy/PingTool/etc. stuff all
put together and shipped off.  Hopefully a lot of
these front-end programs will be supporting Tribes
very soon (I think Kali already has it running and is
just testing a bit... they say it will be out by
Friday the 29th).

     Well, it's out.  I can't tell you how gratifying
it is to see a product like Tribes go out the door
and meet with almost immediate success.  It's fun to
just run the game and look at the server list!  It's
also cool to see all the people that are figuring out
the scripting language and the editor.  Man, that
kicks ass.

     Oh yeah...

     This last week has been probably the toughest
development time in my 10+ years of game development.
It has been a serious grind.  But, we've squashed
some amazingly nasty bugs in what we thought was
already a very clean product.  Just goes to show ya,
I guess.  And now things are looking sweet.  We are
just about to submit our first CD to CPC.  It's close
guys, it's close.

     Finishing touches are coming together... and man
it is looking sweet (and not just because we are
FINALLY (almost) done... it actually looks awesome).
I am mostly dealing with CD audio stuff (Loudmouth
did a kick-ass job on the music tracks) and squashing
the occasional bug.  Install, autorun, all remaining
important issues have all been resolved (or are damn
close).  It's just a matter of last minute bug fixes
and polish now.

	People, it is coming together!
