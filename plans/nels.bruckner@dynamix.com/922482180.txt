     Just a quick note of clarification about the
Quake(2) editor stuff.  The added support will allow
3rd party editors to be used to make the buildings
that get placed in Tribes maps.  Creating landscapes,
placing objects, mission scripting, etc. will all
still be handled via the various tools that ship with
Tribes and/or get shipped in the near future in our
free editing package/patch.  Obviously, it would be
very limiting to use a Quake-style editor to try to
make a whole Tribes level.

     ZED is dead, baby...

     We are putting the (hopefully) finishing touches
on the various mission building tools as well as a
few tweaks to the OpenGL stuff.  We have decided to
end development on our in-house building editor,
"ZED".  We will probably release the current version
of ZED with the other tools but in the near future it
will be replaced with a converter for Quake-style
maps.  Since there are so many good Quake(2) map
editors around (WorldCraft, etc.) this is a pretty
easy decision at this point.  Of course, way back
when we started on Tribes there weren't very many
nice editors available and it seemed like a good idea
to build our own.  Ahhhh, what a difference a few
years can make. :)

     Wow, it's been a long time since I updated.
Lots of stuff has been going on, both with Tribes and
Dynamix.  Things are kinda settling down now... just
in time for me to head off to Cabo San Lucas for a
little vacation!

     On the Tribes front, I'm slowly adjusting to my
new role with the team, which is basically a
managment and coordination role.  I get to make sure
all the loose ends are accounted for, make sure
everyone is communicating, keep everyone both happy
and focused.  Gee, should be a no-brainer. :)

     Our sights are now set firmly on E3... we should
have much cool stuff by then.

     Putting the finishing touches on the patch...
NOT the OpenGL patch.  That comes next.

     Just got all the GameSpy/PingTool/etc. stuff all
put together and shipped off.  Hopefully a lot of
these front-end programs will be supporting Tribes
very soon (I think Kali already has it running and is
just testing a bit... they say it will be out by
Friday the 29th).
