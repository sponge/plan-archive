    <p align="left"><font color="#00FF40"> <font face="Lucida Console"><small>Things are
    cranking along.&nbsp; We are cruising through the creature animations(Eric, Matt, Bryan
    and myself) and will most definitely be done by the end of the month with ALL of them.
    &nbsp; Granted there are always tweaks and things that will be needed as they get the
    final AI for each in but overall we'll be able to sign off on that gig.</small></font></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Lucida Console" color="#00FF40"><small>&nbsp; The other
    projects continue along at a steady pace but obviously the big focus is on getting
    DAIKATANA finished.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Lucida Console" color="#00FF40"><small>&nbsp; The cinematics
    are looking BAD-ASS and a half.&nbsp; The guys on that team right now are Bill Daly,
    Ludovic Texier, Jeff Dotson, Chris DeSimone, and Rayfield Wright.&nbsp; They are kicking
    ass and taking names with all the character animation we have(EVERY SHOT).&nbsp; The
    camera angles are jumping off Jim's storyboards and right onto the screen more HARD-CORE
    than ever.&nbsp; Bryan and I are itching bad to work on them(hehe....I'm doing a little
    pickup on some shots here and there) and will be doing so as soon as we get these
    creatures off the books.&nbsp; When we get closer to the release we'll put together some
    AVI's for all you guys to take a look at.&nbsp; This game is looking better than
    fabulous..</small></font></p>

    color="#00FF00" face="Lucida Console"> I didn't realize how small and petty people can
    get.&nbsp; The opinion pages and .plan files that take shots at us are remarkably immature
    in nature.&nbsp; How sad that you have so little to do that you dedicate your time to
    finding gossip in the Game industry.&nbsp; I know this industry has gotten a shit-load
    more high dollar and high profile than many years back but Jesus.&nbsp; We are a hard
    working group of people that put in a huge amount of blood, sweat and tears into our
    titles.&nbsp; Yeah we get great PR.&nbsp; THANK GOD... be jealous of it all you want but I
    wish everyone the success enough to get an article in TIME or a spot on CNN.&nbsp; It's
    too cool.</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Lucida Console" color="#00FF00"><small> Forming a company and
    keeping it alive and vital takes time and is an ever evolving equation.&nbsp; To think
    that every person(more than 80) that we hired originally would work out just perfectly is
    being very silly.&nbsp; If the relationship doesn't work for professional or personal
    reasons then a parting must occur.&nbsp; No one gets fired or leaves a company because
    they are happy.&nbsp; Yes we try to make people happy and keep them if they are working
    out and right for what they do but in some cases those people need to move on.&nbsp; We
    are a stronger company (personnel wise) than we have ever been.&nbsp; I will tell you that
    I didn't hire untalented people so those that have left go with my recognition of said
    talent.&nbsp; BUT it obviously wasn't working out here and those reasons remain the
    business of those individuals and myself.&nbsp; Many people have forgotten just how small
    this business is and you never know who you'll be working with again. </small></font></p>

    animations with Kris moving to the team permanently.&nbsp; They are all EXTREMELY solid
    animators and are working away on redoing/finishing all of the 80 creatures in this game.
    &nbsp; When I reviewed them all(every single animation for every baddy) I found that I
    could check off the FINISHED boxes for about 6 creatures.&nbsp; WAIT...That doesn't mean
    that we only have six animated, it just means that only 6 of them can be signed off with
    no tweaking or changes required.&nbsp; Ronn and Murphy were cranking through all 80 and
    many need additional animations, changes or complete redoes to get them up to a standard
    that Bryan and I want everything to have.&nbsp; </font></small></p>

    &nbsp; Ronn is a </small><strong>SOLID </strong><small>animator.&nbsp; All of his stuff

    anything he worked on.</small></font></p>
