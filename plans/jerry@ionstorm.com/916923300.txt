Cranking along getting everything ready for the DM tournament next month.  Matt and Justin have been doing a fabulous job of getting the weapon effects looking BAD-ASS.  All the weapons will get touched as we go through each episode but for now the focus is on E1.
Several of the weapons needed completely new effects work while others just need/needed tweaking to get them polished and kicking.

Ludo has begun work on the cinematic sets.  Should be fun doing them all in-engine.  
Everyone is working on getting this episode tight so we can move on to the next.


Kudos to www.Pcaccelerator.com for a very funny take on all this other shit.  Don't know why I had to be the chick but it's a fun read anyway.  Hope they finish it and don't leave us hanging(or should I say stacked).
