	Glad to be back from the holidays.  Had a great time off doing nothing.  Made a point of not doing a damn thing for two weeks.  It's actually harder than it seems.  Got cool shit for Christmas.

The projects are moving along.  The new team on DK are cranking hard and we are making some fantastic progress.  Andrew is doing all the things we've needed done for a while.  Obviously can't say too much on that gig.  The art is progressing.  We were 90% on the game art as of Christmas so the real work left is touchup, cleanup, some reworking where needed, and polish on all the things that aren't there yet.  Everyone is on it and it's looking kick-ass.
ANOX is looking as phenomenal as always.  Lee and the boys are doing a stellar job and the new levels they are doing will blow you away.  
Deus Ex is also cranking.  I'll go down there next week to check up on Jay and those boys.


That's all for now.
