Played through Dynamite Headdy yesterday.  There isn't
a Treasure game yet that I haven't liked.  I also played
through Contra Hard Corps again... both those games
made me remember why I liked them so much.  The bosses.
Those encounters were fun, and it wasn't size or difficulty
of the kill that made them that way...
