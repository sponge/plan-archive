[PANTHER XL UPDATE]

Panther XL users rejoice!  John Scott was kind enough to take a look at the problems you were experiencing with the
joysticks (namely, the inability to look up and down with the track ball) and has fixed them for Heretic 2.  
I believe they are now supported in full!  

Check out http://www.fpgaming.com/a3d/games/heretic2.htm for some configs and info about this joystick.

Song of the Day: "Crush", Dave Matthews Band (Before These Crowded Streets)
And: "IZ-US", Aphex Twin (Come to Daddy)

I swear it's been these two CD's for days now...

[PANTHER XL USERS]

I finally got the Panther XL up and running now (it was having trouble with certain sound cards apparently) 
and I'm going to start looking into the problems people have been having with the track ball directions.  I'll
also work out a basic configuration for the game to include on the menu to save you time (like the game pads).
So many buttons!  If you had any other comments or concerns with this joystick and Heretic 2, let me know.


[DOUBLE-JUMPS AND DOUBLE-TAPS]

Some people have commented that the side flips seem visually off.  Here's why:

I implemented a sort of double jump system for the player.  The flips are cool, but
functionality-wise, flipping through the air doesn't really lend itself for firing or 
trying to grab a ledge.  To fix this, I broke up the jumps into two steps.  When you
first jump, you're in a normal jump.  You can fire, grab, or do anything you want with your
upper torso.  If you do not fire or hold down action and are still holding the jump 
key a few moments after the initial jump, you will preform a flip in the direction of your
jump.  This serves to give you a slight boost in distance, but not too much.  The animations
will be tweaked fully for the final game of course, so you won't notice this visually.  So if
you want to jump and shoot, just hold down your fire button!

Also, now that the demo is out, I should remind everyone once more about the double tapping
and command shifting abilities.

To bind an action to a double-tap, do this:

bind_double [key] [action]

So if you wanted to bind defensive spells to a double tapped mouse key, it would look like this:

bind_double mouse1 +defend

That's it.  Works just like a normal bind.  There is also command shifting.  Think of this as a shift key 
for your bound keys.  While holding the command shift key (which you must assign, be patient) all 
keys can serve as different actions off a single tap.  Here's the setup:

bind [key] +command
bind_command [key] [action]

So if you wanted SHIFT to be your command key, and a command shifted 'W' to jump:

bind SHIFT +command
bind_command w +moveup

When you hold down SHIFT and W, you'll jump.

Follow that?  If not <jweier@mail.ravensoft.com> or I'm sure a friendly fan page would be happy to help.

Enjoy!
