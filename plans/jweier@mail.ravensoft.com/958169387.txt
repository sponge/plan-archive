I've noticed in a few recent articles that there seems to be misconceptions 
about our team and normal NPC AI.  We are not using any bot code from 
Quake 3 in our single player game; that's been gone for awhile.  The bots 
in our multiplayer game are direct descendants from Q3, but our single player 
AI is a totally new breed.  This was necessary because AI and behaviors for 
multiplayer differ drastically from single player, both in the guts of the 
code and in how the player perceives things.  The AI system has been tailored 
to work directly with ICARUS, and to allow us to pull off the team behavior.

Just wanted to calm any fears that our single player NPCs would be deathmatch 
bots.
