<b>AstroCreep over at MapCenter kicks off a new Challenge</b>
Starting Dec 7th <a href="http://mapcenter.digitalarenas.com">MapCenter</a> starts off it's first Map Challenge. We've decided to start off with something simple and picked Doors, doorways, and Archway prefabs. Although it's called a "challenge", there is no winner, it's more of a challenge to the mapper to create new and interesting stuff. 
 
The challenge will last for 2 weeks, with a one week break before the next one starts
 
Rules and guidelines can here in this <a href="http://mapcenter.digitalarenas.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=13&t=000014">thread</a> of the Mapcenter forums.
 
The challenge is open to anyone who wants to take part. For those that are not into joining forums, but use IRC, they can stop by  irc.enterthegame.com #mapcenter and get help there on the challenge.

<b>MAP CENTER TEXTURE CHALLENGE #2 UNDERWAY</b>
The <a href="http://mapcenter.digitalarenas.com">MapCenter</a> Texture Challenge #2 (flags) has just one week left (ends on Dec. 7th). There are currently 24 flag texture so far, and participants are making some very impressive entries so far.

As before with the first challenge, a preview map will be included with the challenge download for easy viewing.
 
Also we will be starting up map challenges (actually prefab packs) soon. The first few will be geared towards Q3A, then we will start to mix it up with Wolf stuff somewhere around the begining of the new year.

THREEWAVE CTF MOD
If you like Capture the Flag style team play action ... if you ever thought that the Classic Threewave version of CTF was the end-all and be-all of CTF gaming and all else merely imitators ... or if you just want a boatload of polished maps for Q3A AND Q3:TA Get the <a href="http://www.threewave.com">Threewave mod</a> for Quake III Arena AND Quake III: Team Arena NOW. Mirrored Sites are standing by, waiting for your call. Have some bandwidth ready.

A CLASS-ACT MAP MODEL DOWNLOAD SITE 
Bill Brooks, one of the regulars on the Quake3World and MapCenter forums has set up what is hands down the best site in the world for downloading map models for Q3A map making. He has most all the models from the first two QuakeCon model contests AND ... to the best of anyone's knowledge ... every map model that has been released for general public use by the Q3A map making community. And if that's not enough, Bill has been putting up models just about as fast as they are released. Models aren't reviewed and there are minimal descriptions, but that's hardly a downside. The accompanying picture shows most of what you need to know. If you're a mapper looking for models, or a modeler looking for a place to get your new Q3A map model out to the world, I can't think of a better place to go than the <a href="http://fps.brainerd.net/">F.P.S.</a> model links pages. Thanks Bill!

MAPCENTER LIVES!
Speaking of Class Acts, AstroCreep has given his Q3A mapping page <a href="http://mapcenter.digitalarenas.com/">MapCenter@qeradiant</a> and the <href="http://mapcenter.digitalarenas.com/">accompanying forums</a> a major facelift. MapCenter focuses on Q3A and Q3:TA map content creation. Anyone familiar with the Quake3World level editing and modeling forums will find a few familiar names here among the moderators and the forum regulars. The content focuses on Quake III Arena right now, but expect to see some Return to Castle Wolfenstein support in the future as development tools become available for the game.

GTKRadiant v1.1.1
Ttimo and his volunteer crew of talented toolmakers have updated the Quake 3 ARena editing tool, GTKRadiant to a full release version. This tool is slowly becoming THE tool to use for Q3A map making, as it can easily switch between vanilla Q3A, Q3:TA AND mods for editing. Get the latest version <href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/index.php3?directory=/qeradiant/GtkRadiant">here</a>. Comes in WinX version only right now. Linux flavor <href="http://www.3ddownloads.com/index.php3?directory=/qeradiant/GtkRadiant">here also</a>.

QUAKECON 2001 MAP OBJECT MODEL WINNERS ANNOUNCED

The final results from the QuakeCon 2001 Model Contest were announced Sunday, August 12th at QuakeCon 2001. The contest, sponsored by Discreet, NVidia, Linksys, id Software, and Polycount challenged model makers around the world to produce models which could be used as the centerpieces of maps; models which would demand that maps be built to house them; models which would literally knock the contest judges’ socks off.

The contest was announced first on the www.polycount.com website and the models will be displayed and made available for download there. Discreet, NVidia and Linksys provided a generous selection of their products as prizes.

The 18 model makers, who entered submitted 22 separate models or suites of models, comprised of over 50 individual model components. “The contestants really outdid themselves this year. The talent they exhibited was overwhelming,” said contest coordinator Paul Jaquays of id Software. “I can’t wait to see these models start appearing in game maps.”
