QUAKECON 2001 MAP OBJECT MODEL CONTEST KICKS OFF!

id Software, polycount, QuakeCon 2001 and its sponsors invite entries into the second annual QuakeCon Map Object  Model contest. As before, its a competition to create outstanding models for maps used by Quake III: Arena, its expansions, and community-made game modifications. This year, the contest has a simple theme:  Impressive. Were looking for centerpieces, models or suites of models so incredibly impressive that they inspire mapmakers to build play spaces simply to house them. Maybe inspire isnt the right word here. They should DEMAND that maps be built around them. We want model makers to knock our socks off.
Models can be for any style or theme of map or mod, including gothic, tech, or realistic. They just need to be overwhelmingly impressive.
As before, model makers will be competing for some great prizes, which will be announced at a later date as details are finalized. The contest begins with this announcement. All contest entries must be complete and in the hands of the contest coordinator before midnight, CDT August 3, 2001. A panel of industry judges will review accepted entries and cast their votes prior to Quakecon. Contest winners will be announced at QuakeCon 2001 in Mesquite, Texas.
Complete rules and contest details can be found at www.polycount.com contest page. 

Here are important highlights:
