The QuakeCon 2001 MapObject Model Contest gallery map is now officially in the hands of the contest judges. Eighteen modelers (and a few texture artists) submitted 22 entries comprised of individual models and suites of models (over 50 in all).

A "player" version with of the map, with appropriate credits, will be released to QuakeCon Attendees after the judges have submitted their ballots. A public version of the map will be released after the convention. Models will be released at some point after that.

Special thanks go to Timothee "Ttimo" Besset who helped me through some editor issues over the weekend and Camilla "milla" Bennett who whipped up a rework of the convention logo for inclusion as a texture plaque in the gallery map.

NOTE: Participation by Judges noted below will depend upon their availability at the time the gallery map is ready for review.

QUAKECON SEMINARS
**********************************************************************
SEMINAR: TRASH MY MAP

One of the seminars I'm hosting at QuakeCon is going to be an off the cuff, shoot from the hip, no-holds barred (leave your sensitive egos at home), on the spot map review of maps made be convention attendees. It takes place Saturday August 10th at 10:30 AM in the seminar ballrooms.

I've twisted the arms of a couple Q3A engine level designers from other companies who are going to be at the show and convinced them to sit in on this with me (and I expect to hear from a couple more after this). We've got barely and hour and we'll run through (not play) as many maps as we can in that time frame (no more than 5 to 10 minutes per map). One of us will drive and we'll run through the map on the big screen making comments, criticisms and hopefully useful suggestions for fixing up maps in production.

That's right ... maps in production ... not final released maps. To be reviewed, a map must work with vanilla Q3A or Team Arena. Any textures not in the original games must be in the map's pak file. The map MUST be compiled and in a pak file. No map files.  Finally only maps by convention attendees will be reviewed ... and the map maker must be present in the seminar.

To submit a map for review, send an email to the main QuakeCon model contest address: <a href="mailto:qc01model@idsoftware.com?subject=Trash My Map Submission">qc01model@idsoftware.com</a>. In the email give me a download link that I can grab after August 4th. If you need to make other submission arrangements let me know.

Maps to be reviewed and the order of review will be chosen by random drawing prior to the seminar. If the map maker is not present in the seminar room, we move onto the next victim. Looking forward to seeing you there bright and early. ;)

SEMINAR: HOW DO I GET YOUR JOB?

This bit of informal dicussion (probably a panel of "famous" game makers if I can convince them to reveal their life stories), will discuss breaking into the industry. If we run out of steam on that topic, we can move onto general questions from the audience that don't require that the panel members to reveal corporate or trade secrets. Takes place at 2:00 PM on Thursday, August 9th.

SEMINAR: WHEN DOES TRIBUTE BECOME TRESPASS?

This panel presentation seminar at 1:30 PM on Saturday deals with the sticky issue of "Foxxing" ... where mods are shut down for infringement on intellectual property rights. We intend to present a history of "foxxing", give an overview of copyright law as it relates to game mods, touch on "fair use" in the same light, and give some insight into why companies must protect their copyrights and trademarks. Ideally, we'll have some time for discussion. As long as everyone understands that we aren't dishing out legal advice or establishing company polices, we'll do just fine. 

See you at QuakeCon!
