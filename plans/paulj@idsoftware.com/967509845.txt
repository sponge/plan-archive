Polycount has opened up public judging for the QuakeCon2000 Map Object Model Contest. For those that can't remember, The QuakeCon Model Contest began a month before QuakeCon, the models were sent to Rogue13 at Polycount to be put in a gallery for display, and they were to be voted on by the crowd in the BYOC area at QCon. However, things didn't work out as planned, so Polycount has exercised some coding skillz and put a public voting system in place. Check out the details of the contest and vote on the contest page and check out these cool categories for winners: 

Sweetest Eye Candy - best effects, skin, in the showing 
Most Awesomely Gothic - the best Gothic model 
Industrial Magic - the best Base or Industrial style model 
The Real Thing - the best model for a "realistic" level or mod 
 Most Likely to be Mistaken for a Marital Aid - you probably can get this one 
Most Versatile - goes with everything 
Most Artistic - Rembrandt, Van Gogh and Picasso better make room for this 
That's Really Weird - homage to the unusual 

Get out and vote!

I'd like to take just up a fraction of your bandwidth to promote a new specialty store being opened by a friend near Dallas, TX.

If you're a fan of Japanese anime and live or work on the eastern side of the Dallas, Texas metroplex, or anywhere along the HWY 30 corridor in NE Texas, you may want to check out the newly opened FRIED ANT ANIME store.

The store carries a full line of anime videos and box sets, manga, graphic novels, wall scrolls and posters, t-shirts, art books and collectibles. They will also be carrying a limited selection of roleplaying game materials. 

An Anime Fan Club will be starting soon with movie viewings, costume contests, fan art contests and more.

And did I mention that the store also features a selection of limited edition, signed & numbered art prints by yours truly?


Store hours are:  M-Thursday 11-7, Fri and Sat 11-9, closed Sunday.
Phone # is metro (972) 772-4812

     Fried Ant Anime
     2006 South Goliad (Hwy 205) Suite 222
     Rockwall, Tx 75087

The store is in the "Hobby Lobby" shopping center, at Exit 68 off Highway 30. Just go a little north when you get off the highway.

I'm told that they will be getting in NightMare Before Christmas merchandise soon ... for those of you who just can't get enough of that.
