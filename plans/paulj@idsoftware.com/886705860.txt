OK, here's some hype.  First, I don't know when we'll be officially dropping the point release in your laps.  "Real Soon Now", OK?  But I can pitch you some news about what WON'T be in it. If you've had a chance to download and play Tim's Base 100 mega map, then you'll be ready for the Sewer (from xian) and City (from me) mega maps.  Sewer is all new.  Xian can tell you what he thinks is cool about it, but its got lots of pipes and water  :). 

If you enjoyed the long vistas in City 1, then I think you'll like what the City mega map has to offer.  Railgunning distant tiny clusters of pixels and seeing them burst into red spray has a certain satisfaction to the sniper in all of us.  Sneaky Field-of-View modifying bindings will add a certain degree of power to some players' arsenals.  

My basic theme for the map was "really big, open, and outdoors."  To begin the design, I clipped out some major pieces of City1 and made it possible to reach all those really high places (anyone ever want to snipe from the top of the "temple" building from City1?).  The "big valley" from City1 has been replaced with an interlinked canyon complex.  Some simple "palace" rooms have been added (one of them started out as a CTF map ... but changed gears midstream).  There's a few passages from City3 (but alas, nothing came over from City2).  Since I was allowed to play with the "style" of the game, I made the teleports a bit more "obvious."  When you see it, feel free to critique.

I'm also looking forward to the release (after point) of Steed's latest female model (Steeds Chick).  Some of her moves just can't be duplicated by motion capture ... unless of course Supergirl has joined the U.S. Gymnastic team and agreed to a capture session.  

Later,

Paul J.

Nothing else earthshattering to report about 3D games so I thought I'd eat up some bandwidth to pump a project that I worked on for TSR, and just make some general chat. 

DICE GAMES
If you sometimes play games that DON'T involve a computer, check out the MARVEL SUPERHERO DICE GAME from TSR (a wholly owned division of Wizards of the Coast).  It's a combat game where each die represents a character from Marvel comics. The various icons symbolize the character's relevant combat related skills.  The basic set features characters from the X-MEN (mostly classic heroes and villains), but later sets will feature other X-Groups, the Fantastic Four, the SpiderMan comics, the Avengers and so on. You only have to buy one set to play the game (about $14.95). My contribution to the game was creating the basic look for the dice, creating all  the icons, working with the rest of the team to develop the gameplay,  and create/suggest a lot of the super powers.

MORE DICE GAMES
If you are a dice gamer, also check out Dragon Dice. After a big start and then fading away, it's starting to get some fan support again.  I'm talking about the actual dice game, not the computer version.  If you can't get the dice at your local hobby retailer, I'm told that some of the online game and book retailers carry them.

FRANCE UPDATE
I mentioned a couple posts back (I've kept that post below), that my wife and I took a trip to France to meet with friends made on the Internet.  Now some of those friends will be coming to visit us here.  We're excited.

OLD FRIENDS
These posts are good for something [:-)].  Recently, an old friend (back from my Judges Guild days) was hunting around for on-line info to get her husband's copy of Quake 2 up and running happily.  She found my name on the website (then said "d'oh!!" for not looking at the packaging).  It was nice to hear from her again ("Hi, Ree").

BASE 100
I jump on there once or twice a day for practice.  Mostly I'm good for a few free frags, but I am getting better.  Someday I may actually be dangerous. [:-)]

What I did on my Vacation

Most people don't really don't care what you do on your vacation, but I thought I'd share a bit about my Christmas holiday with you, particularly because it is relevant to online gaming.  I'm not big into online chat, but my wife is.  She made quite a large number of friends on the Battle.Net (Diablo) system and "talks" with them daily by way of B.Net and ICQ.  Not so unusual, except that nearly all her friends are French (or French-speaking Canadians).  The story of how this got to be is longer than I want to share here, but one of her friends joked that he would like her to come to his 40th birthday party on New Year's Eve.  She laughed, said she'd ask me for permission (as a joke) and was surprised when I said "Yes, see how much it would cost to go."  To shorten the story, we flew from Dallas to Paris on the 29th and were met by her friend at the airport and he took us to a hotel near his home in central France.  For the next 5 days, we were like a part of his family.  He was our guide, our driver and when necessary, our translator. We partied on New Year's Eve with his friends, became friends with his friends and family (fell in love with his kids), saw a few sights around the France, had lunch near Bordeaux with the young man whom my wife calls her "adopted son," and ended that day with a gourmet meal at our guide's parent's home near the Bretony coast.  The week ended all-too-soon on Saturday night in Paris where we met at a restaurant with a number of other of my wife's friends from Battle.Net.  We had a great time and ended up talking (games, what else) until the small hours of the morning.  They were a great bunch of gals and guys and made us feel like we were at home with them.  While there was some risk in meeting with and trusting people you've never encountered face-to-face, we were overwhelmed by their openess and generosityt, and surprised by the differences between "online" personnas and they way people were in "real life" (generally speaking the real people were nicer).  Worth noting is that many of the friends we met at the Saturday night party were also meeting each other "in the flesh" for the first time that night. All in all, a wonderful ending to a wonderful week. (I'll skip the details of the unpleasant plane ride home ... except to say that they just don't put enough of those little bags in the seat pockets in front of you)

 Would I recommend this type of adventure to others? Yes, but only after you've really gotten to know people ... and if possible, meet in larger groups.

Oh ... how much French do I speak ... barely enough to say good day...

Paul
