Toby Goldstone noted that I am spending too much time around computers ... 
it's "ISBN" not "ISDN".

Also, I'm succumbing to the temptation to add yet another link to the
Judge's Guild web page ... the recipe for "Rat on a Stick" just has
to be shared (I know I want to try it!) [Here come the flames about using
my .plan to share recipes]

These posts seem to run in clusters ... two updates for me in as many days.

First: Let me express some thanks from Nicholas Marks that you folks nearly
shut down his freetextures.com web page yesterday.  He was getting so many
hits that he couldn't get on to do updates.  If you're a commercial hosting
site looking for some hot content, he's also looking for you.

Second: It seems that I may have given a semi-incorrect ISBN number for the
Game Design: Secrets of the Sages book.  The one I gave yesterday came off 
the back of the book, but is apparently for a "not for resale" version." I've 
changed the ISDN to the one that Amazon.com is using.  And by the way, Amazon
has a price deal on the book right now.

Third:  A long time fan wrote yesterday to let me know that my long-ago
employer, Judges Guild, is back in business and has an on line site.
If you are an "old" D&D player (meaning your involvement in the hobby predates
1981), you'll probably remember the Guild and most likely you used or at least
saw their licensed D&D game books in hobby stores.  I worked for Judges
Guild in the late 70's and cranked out a handful of game adventures for them.
What surprised me most is not that the Guild is back, but that it's not under
"new ownership. " This isn't someone who bought the right to use the name (as 
had been rumored some time back).  Bob Bledsaw, the founder of the Guild has
been convinced that the time is right for the phoenix to rise from the ashes 
(so to speak).  Well, if you're interested in role-playing game supplements
and/or adventure gaming nostalgia, check out the Guild at:

Plug time.

I've got a couple items to tout here ... and while they don't have direct
relevance to Quake 3: Arena, they should both be of interest to those of
you who make your own maps or have an interest in a game-related career.

First: 

Looking for some some interesting textures or good source art for 
game textures?  Then you need to put the FREETEXTURES web site on your
list of daily visits.  Why daily? Because Nicholas Marks, the artist who
operates the site is putting up 10 new textures or pieces of reference art
each week day.

Second:
Game Design Secrets of the Sages  ISBN: 1-56686-904-8

This is a new book on the topic of computer game making from MacMillan 
Digital Publishing, edited by Marc Saltzman.  In essence it is a 
compilation of "How I do it" anecdotes harvested from the illuminatii of
the game biz (read that as "the people who do the work") and is organized
into a pretty interesting read.  It looks to be particularly useful to 
those folks who think they want to make a career in game making.
