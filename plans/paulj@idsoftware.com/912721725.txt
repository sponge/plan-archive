I just finished testing a Q3 2-3 player map that left me seriously sweaty palmed.  WooHoo (yeah, it was one of mine and Tim Willits thrashed me around like a dishrag).

Now, the REST of this post is entirely NOT about Quake 3, so you can stop reading now if that’s your sunum bonum.

I like John Cash’s story about his encounters with HP.  It has a happy ending.  I hope mine can work out as well, because I too am really annoyed about what’s going on ... but I don’t have a computer to return as a threat.  By the way, I’m really happy with my Micron machine I bought the past summer (and have recommended them to several others making purchase decisions).  As a footnote to Cash's story, if anyone in HP’s customer service department would like to contact me about my scanner that you supposedly fixed (except for that it works occasionally as opposed to not at all, it’s acting EXACTLY like it did before I sent it in for warranty service.  Alas, it’s no longer under warranty), I'd appreciate that too.

Back to the main topic.

This must be the month for for griping about and flaming Customer Service departments.  

My family and I play Ultima Online. We’re well into our second year on the game, despite early misgivings about the game. If you enjoy RPG type games and can handle having a $10 a month suction applied to your credit card, I highly recommend it.  After the Second Age expansion came out, we decided to upgrade.  My wife placed the order to the EA Store on Oct. 30th: Credit card order over the phone. The order was for two discount Second Age editions (one for a friend overseas who doesn’t want to pay by credit card ... no we don’t do this for everyone so don’t even ask), and two prepayment coupons.  One of the Second Age copies was to be shipped to our house along with the two prepayment coupons and the other Second Age was to be shipped overseas.

Time went by and no game or prepayment coupons showed up.  Our overseas friend’s time on UO was running out.

My wife called, not sure of the exact date, but it had been over two weeks, probably longer.  The customer service checked and found that they had shipped the U.S. portion of the order to the wrong zip code (transposed digits) here in the Dallas area.  I don’t live in Dallas so it was returned to EA as undeliverable (it was returned and no one in customer service at EA called to check why). The agent assured my wife that  they would send it out right away.  

Then they called saying that UPS would be coming to pickup the 2nd age game that was mistakenly sent.  Huh??? Pick up what package? Wires are crossed here. OBVIOUSLY  they had our phone number before, but didn’t call to find out why the game was not delivered correctly.  She asked what was being sent and they told that it was one UO coupon and the 2nd Age game.  They thought that we were only supposed to get one game coupon.  When she told them she had ordered (and paid for) two game coupons and one 2nd Age game to be delivered at this address (and one to another country).  The customer service agent gave her one game time prepayment coupon code over the phone and said that the other game time coupon and the game HAD BEEN SHIPPED..

Ground shipping is not necessarily immediate, so we waited again.  Another two weeks passes. Figuring that something was amiss, we called again.  No help, here, we can’t get through to customer service.

We have tried for three days now to get through on their customer service line.  But the line is always busy. (or now, they say they are away for training sessions), and their service hours are only open during a relatively short time window during the day (basically, they aren’t open before I go to work here at id and are usually closed before I get home at night).  Even trying an around end run by calling sales first and asking to be transferred didn’t work.   The sales associates couldn’t transfer a call to customer service because the lines were so busy.

So, here it is more than 30 days after I ordered a game that was shipping and in stock and paid for it with a credit card. Now, U.S. credit law requires that items purchased using a credit card MUST be delivered within 30 days or the purchaser must be notified and given the opportunity to get his money back.  Not only has that not happened, but I’ve already been billed for the purchase on my credit card (they let no grass grow under that order).

Meanwhile, I have no UO second age upgrade, I have no idea what has happened to the shipment enroute to our friend overseas and EA apparently can’t properly staff their customer service lines in order to allow me to grill a human being about the problem.

Arrrgh!!
