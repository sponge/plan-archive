<b>FINAL THOUGHTS</b>
A Time for Every Purpose

<i>"For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven</i>
<i>"... a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;"</i>
 
<i>Ecclesiastes 3:1-2</i>
 

I’ll drop the bombshell here and get it over with. For me, this is a time to "pluck up what is planted."

Yesterday, March 7th marked the 5th anniversary of my joining id Software. So the timing of this message is somewhat ironic in nature.

After much consideration and soul searching, I've decided to part ways with id. Today, March 8th, is my last day as an id Software employee. 

After five years of making first person shooters like Quake2, Quake III Arena, and Quake III: Team Arena, I’ve come to the realization that my heart just isn’t in it any more. For this reason, I’ve decided to make a slight shift in career direction and seek other design and development challenges. I have accepted a position with Ensemble Studios (the creators of the Age of Empires series and Age of Mythology) here in Dallas, and will be taking up my new duties with them in short order.  I’m excited about the new job and I understand that the entire team there is excited to have me come on board.

I want to thank everyone who has made my id experience an interesting ride, including the guys here at id, Ms. Donna, and especially the friends I’ve made in the on-line mapping, modeling, and texturing communities. 

Anyone who needs to contact me directly should still be able to do so through my id email address for a while yet. Or you can check for me up on the <a href="http://www.Map-Center.com">MapCenter </a> forums.

Well, it has been fun, honest, but the time has come to power down this system, pack up a few remaining personal items, shake some hands, say my farewells, and head on out the door. Catch you all later.

P.S. … and don’t worry about Doom, the guys who have been doing all the really cool stuff for the game are still busting their chops hard as ever on it.
