VEGAS VACATION
Like most of the rest of id, my wife and I were in Vegas for our release party.  No winnings or great losings to report (If you don't gamble, you don't lose).

If you're in Vegas, check out the following attractions: 

THE GUN STORE.  Ruta and I went and shot full auto machine guns there (an UZI and an H & K MP5).  Not as exciting as I expected (I mean you had to be careful and point it at the target and all that ... no running around crazy firing at anything that moves). I've got a couple paper targets here in my office with a whole lot of holes in the head area.  'Course, they weren't moving or firing back...  They were extremely helpful and kids were welcome to shoot if accompanied by a responsible parent or guardian.  If you've got your own car, The Gun Store is an easy ride from the Strip.  If you're taking a cab, it's a bit pricey.

STAR TREK: THE EXPERIENCE.  This just opened in January out at the Las Vegas Hilton.  This attraction could be compared to BODY WARS and STAR TOURS at Walt Disney World.  However, ST:tE is head and shoulders above those two.  By using actors who make the storyline come alive (instead of just folks who tell you to keep your seat belts buckled at all times), you are drawn into the event.  The Special effects were also pretty darn nice. You need not be a "Trekkie" to enjoy this one.

E-MAIL: I don't mind responding to questions from the community.  It's not that hard to hit the reply button and write back.  But it really irks me to spend time crafting (and sometimes researching) a response only to have it bounce because someone thought it was cute to put a bogus return path into their e-mail.  Want an answer to a question, send e-mail with a valid return path.  I don't resend the stuff that bounces.

Later,

Paul J.

OK, here's some hype.  First, I don't know when we'll be officially dropping the point release in your laps.  "Real Soon Now", OK?  But I can pitch you some news about what WON'T be in it. If you've had a chance to download and play Tim's Base 100 mega map, then you'll be ready for the Sewer (from xian) and City (from me) mega maps.  Sewer is all new.  Xian can tell you what he thinks is cool about it, but its got lots of pipes and water  :). 

If you enjoyed the long vistas in City 1, then I think you'll like what the City mega map has to offer.  Railgunning distant tiny clusters of pixels and seeing them burst into red spray has a certain satisfaction to the sniper in all of us.  Sneaky Field-of-View modifying bindings will add a certain degree of power to some players' arsenals.  

My basic theme for the map was "really big, open, and outdoors."  To begin the design, I clipped out some major pieces of City1 and made it possible to reach all those really high places (anyone ever want to snipe from the top of the "temple" building from City1?).  The "big valley" from City1 has been replaced with an interlinked canyon complex.  Some simple "palace" rooms have been added (one of them started out as a CTF map ... but changed gears midstream).  There's a few passages from City3 (but alas, nothing came over from City2).  Since I was allowed to play with the "style" of the game, I made the teleports a bit more "obvious."  When you see it, feel free to critique.

I'm also looking forward to the release (after point) of Steed's latest female model (Steeds Chick).  Some of her moves just can't be duplicated by motion capture ... unless of course Supergirl has joined the U.S. Gymnastic team and agreed to a capture session.  

Later,

Paul J.
