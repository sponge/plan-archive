MEGAMAPS -- THEY'RE HERE!!:
In case you missed Christian's .plan announcement yesterday, the megamaps are available for download.   Special thanks to those of you who have written and expressed your enthusiasm for these maps.  Nice to know that my work is appreciated by you guys and gals ... and that I make the best Death Match maps ever made.   :0)

Positive or negative, I'd love to hear your critiques on the mega-maps.

Q2 NEWS & STUFF:
Slowly cranking away on my Mission Pack unit.  Just ripped out a bunch of stuff because it added size without adding fun (they were mostly duplicated hallway modules).

CONGRATULATIONS:
To my daughter for being accepted into her school district's Gifted and Talented program.

My buddy Todd Lockwood for being elected Vice President of the Association of Science Fiction and Fantasy Artists.  (ASFA).  I told him I'd rejoin if he was elected, so it's time to pony up my dues.  For those of you who may be curious about the association, check out their web page at:

http://www.scifi.com/scifi.con/art/asfa

If you have more than a passing interest in science fiction and fantasy art (as a creator or collector), this is the association for you.  The association is also responsible for the annual Chesley Awards given to artists in the field.

AIRBRUSH EQUIPMENT:
I'm going to be putting my art studio back together in a couple months.  Part of that is acquiring air brush equipment. Before coming to id, I used a set up at TSR  that I put together, but I wonder if I could make some better choices for the future (since I'll be spending my own money this time).  I'm curious if any of you out there have opinions and preferences on professional grade equipment.  I plan to use acrylics (probably Golden liquid acrylics for the most part).  What I used to use was:

1.5 hp silent compressor with about a 5 gallon tank on it (I can't remember the brand).  It bled oil like crazy.  I had it double filtered (the one on the compressor kept the oil out of the airline ... but was mostly done to put a pressure guage where I could reach it when working).

Valve set-up to allow simultaneous use of two airbrushes.

A light weight dual-action Iwata with a gravity feed color cup for fine work (a mid-range priced airbrush)

An inexpenxive dual-action Paasche for heavy body work ... usually using the middle weight nozzle and needle.

What I'm looking for in equipment is:

Airbrushes
Moderate cost, but Professional grade equipment (one for heavy work, the other for fine work)
Reasonable availability of replacement parts (I always keep at least TWO backup sets of needles and nozzles)
Relatively easy to field strip and reassemble

Compressor
Moderate cost (up to $700)
Enough power for two airbrushes
Silent
Reliable
Portable

Has anyone used the Aztech line of airbrushes and been happy with them?  I've got one set of positive feedback from someone I used to work with at TSR, but he was a relative newbie to airbrushing and really didn't put a lot of "stress" on his equipment.

MUSIC:
THE BIG PICTURE.  Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra.  A collection of movie suites and themes.
PLANET OF THE APES.  Jerry Goldsmith's original soundtrack.
ORIGINAL TV SOUNDTRACKS: BEST OF STAR TREK 30th ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL

VEGAS VACATION
Like most of the rest of id, my wife and I were in Vegas for our release party.  No winnings or great losings to report (If you don't gamble, you don't lose).

If you're in Vegas, check out the following attractions: 

THE GUN STORE.  Ruta and I went and shot full auto machine guns there (an UZI and an H & K MP5).  Not as exciting as I expected (I mean you had to be careful and point it at the target and all that ... no running around crazy firing at anything that moves). I've got a couple paper targets here in my office with a whole lot of holes in the head area.  'Course, they weren't moving or firing back...  They were extremely helpful and kids were welcome to shoot if accompanied by a responsible parent or guardian.  If you've got your own car, The Gun Store is an easy ride from the Strip.  If you're taking a cab, it's a bit pricey.

STAR TREK: THE EXPERIENCE.  This just opened in January out at the Las Vegas Hilton.  This attraction could be compared to BODY WARS and STAR TOURS at Walt Disney World.  However, ST:tE is head and shoulders above those two.  By using actors who make the storyline come alive (instead of just folks who tell you to keep your seat belts buckled at all times), you are drawn into the event.  The Special effects were also pretty darn nice. You need not be a "Trekkie" to enjoy this one.

E-MAIL: I don't mind responding to questions from the community.  It's not that hard to hit the reply button and write back.  But it really irks me to spend time crafting (and sometimes researching) a response only to have it bounce because someone thought it was cute to put a bogus return path into their e-mail.  Want an answer to a question, send e-mail with a valid return path.  I don't resend the stuff that bounces.

Later,

Paul J.
