For a while, I've been hinting to folks on model making forums that there would be some changes in the next point release regarding the creation of teams for Team Arena and also some changes to skin handling for Q3A.

The primary focus of the new document is making new teams for Quake III: Team Arena, but there's also huge amount of information in it on making TA and Q3A models, and a look at some new code involving both TA and Q3A models. There are RTF (Rich Text Format ... compatible with many Word Processors) and html versions available as separate downloads.

Anyone who has been itching to re-skin James and Janet or make their clan team (and have it work in game) will now have their chance.

The new release also supports new models for teams in TA, use of Q3A head models on TA models (these are not modified models and most look ugly as sin when in place on Janet and James), and a skin-naming convention that will allow the team color variations of user made Q3A model skins to replace the skin in team games, instead of the model's default skin.

The manual is about 34 pages long, but don't be overwhelmed by that. A good share of the document is examples of scripts and directory contents.

As I write this, id's ftp site is currently being hammered by folks wanting to download the beta version of the 1.29f point release, so access to our servers may be difficult. But you will be able to grab the documents from:

QUAKECON 2001 MAP OBJECT MODEL CONTEST KICKS OFF!

id Software, polycount, QuakeCon 2001 and its sponsors invite entries into the second annual QuakeCon Map Object  Model contest. As before, it’s a competition to create outstanding models for maps used by Quake III: Arena, its expansions, and community-made game modifications. This year, the contest has a simple theme:  “Impressive.” We’re looking for centerpieces, models or suites of models so incredibly impressive that they inspire mapmakers to build play spaces simply to house them. Maybe “inspire” isn’t the right word here. They should DEMAND that maps be built around them. We want model makers to knock our socks off.
Models can be for any style or theme of map or mod, including gothic, tech, or realistic. They just need to be overwhelmingly impressive.
As before, model makers will be competing for some great prizes, which will be announced at a later date as details are finalized. The contest begins with this announcement. All contest entries must be complete and in the hands of the contest coordinator before midnight, CDT August 3, 2001. A panel of industry judges will review accepted entries and cast their votes prior to Quakecon. Contest winners will be announced at QuakeCon 2001 in Mesquite, Texas.
Complete rules and contest details can be found at <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/contest/mapmodel2k1/qc01mmc.shtml">www.polycount.com contest page</a>. 

Here are important highlights:
·	All contest entrants younger than the age of 18 must submit a signed consent form prior to contest judging.
·	All contest entries must be original works and unreleased or undistributed in any form prior to the contest.
·	All entries must be the work of the entrant.
·	Entries may be the work of teams, but only one prize will be awarded per entry.
·	Models must be textured or “skinned”. 
·	Models must be submitted as working .md3 format models (Quake III Arena model format) in pk3 file form.
·	Entries remain the property of the entrants.
·	The decisions of the contest coordinator and judges are final.

Questions and concerns may be directed to the contest coordinator, Paul Jaquays, at

[note: this site recently changed location ... the address is correct here]

Every so often, I bump into something that reminds me of the degree of influence that a book, a movie, or even a game can have on people. Today is one of those days. If you've got the time, check out the gallery of wallpaper art at <a href="http://http://www.planetquake.com/quake_the_wall/">Quake_the_Wall</a>

The collection of Quake 3 Arena inspired art in this on-line gallery simply amazes me. It's not often that something on the web gives me such a feeling of awe and wonder, and yet at the same time humbles me, reminding me that we have some of the greatest (and most talented) fans in the world.


To the artists, just ... wow. I'm impressed by your devotion and talent.

To Blue, thanks for mentioning this page in your news.

To the guys at Spain Quake 3 Arena, Muchos Gracias. That's quite a collection. Thanks for taking the effort to put those pages where we all can see and enjoy them.

-Paul

Three months to the day after releasing Team Arena Map Pack 1, we're proud to announce the release of a second map pack for the Quake III Arena game expansion, Quake III: Team Arena. As before, this id-approved map pack contains the work of four mappers from the on-line gaming community. This time, three are conversions of previously released Quake III Arena Capture the Flag maps (Dynatron by Ned Man, Courtyard Conundrum by Casey of Threewave, and Smear Campaign by riscchip). The fourth map (PYRmageddon)is an original map, created for Quake III: Team Arena. These maps have be modified and updated to work with the four Team Arena game types: Capture the Flag, One Flag CTF, Overload, and Harvester.

These maps are an exciting addition to the growing number of maps available for Quake III: Team Arena and will make a great addition to the map rotation on any server.

You can download the TA_mappak2 at id's ftp site. 

<a href="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/teamarena/map_paks/TA_mappak2.zip">Team Arena Map Pak 2</a>

File size is 17.35 mg. Other download mirrors will be announced here as they become available.

If you're into making game mods (and not just for id games), then you ought to be aware of a the buzzwords "Intellecutal Property" also known as IP and how they may affect you. Ever since Fox forced a Quake mod based on the Aliens movies to shut down (hence the term "foxxing" for shutting down a mod), mod makers have become a bit more aware that the owners of popular culture copyrights and trademarks may not be amused by game conversions of their properties. Instead of saying "Thanks for the support" to these devoted fans of their game, cartoon character, or movie, they move to shut down the mod and demand it no longer be worked upon or distributed. Not a fun thing if you love the subject of the mod and have put countless hours into creating it.

If you are making mods, or are planning to make a mod based on something out of popular culture (a game, a movie, anime, cartoon characters, etc.), you owe it to yourself to read Caryn "Hellchick" Law's essay on the topic over at 3dActionplanet.

The link below will download the installer (with EULA) for the wire mesh art used to create the character skins for the Team Arnea models. Included are the mesh layouts for the two team models (male and female), all 11 character heads, and the mesh layouts for Pi and Fritzkrieg, the two tourney models.

The latest version of GtkRadiant is available. This new build supports Quake III: Team Arena and contains new editing media from Id. 

The documentation (<a href="http://www.qeradiant.com/manual">http://www.qeradiant.com/manual</a>) has been updated with two new items: the terrain manual 
(<a href="http://www.qeradiant.com/manual/Terrain_Manual/start.html">http://www.qeradiant.com/manual/Terrain_Manual/start.html</a>) and the Team Arena Mapping Help (<a href="http://www.qeradiant.com/manual/Team_Arena_Mapping_Help/start.html">http://www.qeradiant.com/manual/Team_Arena_Mapping_Help/start.html</a>). We now have everything under HTML format, and the setups contain an offline version.

A few new mapobjects are included in this release:
- tree models used in TA terrain maps (baseq3/models/mapobjects/tree2)
- TA spawns (missionpack/models/mapobjects/spawn)

You now have to select the game in the project settings dialog, set it to Quake III Arena or to Quake III: Team Arena depending on what you want to do. GtkRadiant is fairly different from Id's internal 200f Q3Radiant. It doesn't require copying the Team Arena pak file into your baseq3/ directory. Everything is fully documented on the GtkRadiant start page (<a href="http://www.qeradiant.com/gtkradiant.shtml">http://www.qeradiant.com/gtkradiant.shtml</a>).


The main GtkRadiant page is at <a href="http://www.qeradiant.com/gtkradiant.shtml">http://www.qeradiant.com/gtkradiant.shtml</a>
