New year. New projects.

Today I'm snarly because of the hiccups being caused by software/equipment upgrades that are keeping me from finishing BigCity (a massive DM only variant of my city maps). *Sigh*  Maybe its also because I had to take my kids in early to school today, so there was no retreating back into bed this morning.  Oooops.  Cash got it working again.  Snarls gone.  Thanks John!

I want to extend a special thanks to those of you who wrote and encouraged me NOT to give up on Glen Cook's Black Company series.  They kept on getting better!  Of course, now I have another problem.  Book 5, Dreams of Steel, is apparently out of print (and the author finished with a cliff-hanger ending ... aargh!!!).  I haven't done exhaustive searches in the Dallas area yet (but neither B&N online or Amazon.Com have it in stock).  Suggestions as to where to look for it are welcome!

My wife and I saw The Postman the other night (based on David Brin's SF novel of the same name).  Although the movie preserves the basic underling theme of the book ("the lie that becomes the greatest truth"), and does convey parts of the author's message,  I have to agree with the guy who wrote me and said that except for a few names and events, the book and the movie are two completely different stories.  If you've read the book (so you know what is going on), have the price of a movie burning holes in your pocket and have 3 hours (yes 3 hours!!) to kill, go see it.  Otherwise, wait for the rental.

What I did on my Vacation

Most people don't really don't care what you do on your vacation, but I thought I'd share a bit about my Christmas holiday with you, particularly because it is relevant to online gaming.  I'm not big into online chat, but my wife is.  She made quite a large number of friends on the Battle.Net (Diablo) system and "talks" with them daily by way of B.Net and ICQ.  Not so unusual, except that nearly all her friends are French (or French-speaking Canadians).  The story of how this got to be is longer than I want to share here, but one of her friends joked that he would like her to come to his 40th birthday party on New Year's Eve.  She laughed, said she'd ask me for permission (as a joke) and was surprised when I said "Yes, see how much it would cost to go."  To shorten the story, we flew from Dallas to Paris on the 29th and were met by her friend at the airport and he took us to a hotel near his home in central France.  For the next 5 days, we were like a part of his family.  He was our guide, our driver and when necessary, our translator. We partied on New Year's Eve with his friends, became friends with his friends and family (fell in love with his kids), saw a few sights around the France, had lunch near Bordeaux with the young man whom my wife calls her "adopted son," and ended that day with a gourmet meal at our guide's parent's home near the Bretony coast.  The week ended all-too-soon on Saturday night in Paris where we met at a restaurant with a number of other of my wife's friends from Battle.Net.  We had a great time and ended up talking (games, what else) until the small hours of the morning.  They were a great bunch of gals and guys and made us feel like we were at home with them.  While there was some risk in meeting with and trusting people you've never encountered face-to-face, we were overwhelmed by their openess and generosityt, and surprised by the differences between "online" personnas and they way people were in "real life" (generally speaking the real people were nicer).  Worth noting is that many of the friends we met at the Saturday night party were also meeting each other "in the flesh" for the first time that night. All in all, a wonderful ending to a wonderful week. (I'll skip the details of the unpleasant plane ride home ... except to say that they just don't put enough of those little bags in the seat pockets in front of you)

 Would I recommend this type of adventure to others? Yes, but only after you've really gotten to know people ... and if possible, meet in larger groups.

Oh ... how much French do I speak ... barely enough to say good day...

Paul
