For those of you that didn't know this, a big part of the plot in Wages of
Sin changes depending on what YOU do. You will visit levels at different
times of the day and in a different order. You will see different
cinematics, even the location of where the hostage is held changes.

If you KILL Dr. Lansing, or leave the room before he gets a chance to talk
to you (or if you never find him) the order of levels is as follows:
- Warehouses will be visited in the daytime
- Shipyards will be visited in the daytime
- Ship will be visited in the daytime
- Nightclub will be visited at night
- Vacant Building will be visited at night

If you listen to Dr Lansing, the order of levels is as follows:
- Nightclub will be visited during the day
- Vacant Building will be visited during the day
- Warehouses will be visited at night
- Shipyards will be visited at night
- Ship will be visited at night

Whether you visit a location during the day or night will actually change
the gameplay. For instance visiting the Shipyards at night makes for a
stealthier mission since there are fewer workers at night than in the day,
whereas visiting the Shipyards in the day requires you to keep your gun
holstered in order to prevent the workers from freaking out. Check it out!
