OK, Here's the scoop. For those of you interested on the status of the 
official SiN Mission Pack. The game is entitled "Wages of SiN" is being 
published by Activision and should be available in February.

We believe its the most expansive add-on pack ever created. It includes 
17 new single player levels, 7 new weapons, 12 new deathmatch levels, 4 
new characters, 12 new enemies that include 2 end-level bosses. We have 
made changes to the AI, vehicle code, particle effects, etc. 

We created new music tracks, sounds, dialog, cinematics, effects, traps 
and a completely new storyline, which of course teams us up with Blade and 
his side kick JC. 

Something else thats new to the SiN universe is the Hoverbike. Weve 
created from scratch new vehicle code, which allows the player to ride 
around on something similar to a levitating motorcycle. Its equipped with 
3 weapons and a turbo-boost that can really accelerate your speed. We have 
so much fun playing Hoverbike Deathmatch that we think it will be the next 
big thing. 

Anyway, enough of me tooting my horn. Just needed to do the official plan file thing.
