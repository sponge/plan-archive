In addition to working on our Quake3 based game for Electronic Arts,
weâ€™ve created a new division of 2015 in order to meet the demand for 
smaller, more affordable titles. Its name is Trainwreck Studios. 
Trainwreck's first release is "Laser Arena" which is based on 
Laser Tag and is intended for a younger audience. We've licensed the 
Quake1 engine and have made several enhancements to it. The game 
is currently being shipped to Software Etc., Target, Kmart, etc.
