Cool!  Duane has a new "dynamic finger page" running for the entire company... at any given moment in time, you can check to see who's wasting the most time updating their plan file. ;)

Lots of planning underway for Unreal2 -- many things afoot... but, nothing I can talk about right now.  It's all too preliminary.  I'm going to start updating more regularly once we get out of pre-production.

I'll probably have more follow-up info re: WoT at some point as well.  Although, Glen's updates at http://www.wheeloftime.com probably say everything that needs to be said.  Between our BBS, our readme at http://www.legendent.com/wheeloftime/readme/english.htm and GT's support link at http://www.gtisonline.com/pc/wheeloftime.html, I think we're almost at the point of providing too many sources of information.  What do you think?   Write to Sam on our BBS.

Hey, I guess you can tell it's been a while since I've visited the BBS -- cool new format.  I love the "summary icon" -- not too many thumbs downs... that's always nice. ;)
