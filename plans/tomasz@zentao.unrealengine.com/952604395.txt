I don't really know what is going on in my life. I don't think that
this is the best place to be musing, but shit, it's as good as I can
find right now, so why not? ;)

It's hard to find the right path to walk, and I guess it's even harder
to walk the path that you choose, but sometimes I think that walking
the path in itself can be a part of life that shouldn't be missed. It
reminds you that not everything is as 'peachy' as you would like it to
be.

The things that hurt most though are the things that people say about
the sort of person that you are I guess. I tried to do something that
I thought was good and right, and I thought that a gift to someone
would be perhaps not appreciated as much as sometihng that would come
in handy, but as it turns out, it seems that someone isn't talking to
me. Perhaps one day, I will understand that properly, but as it is, I
can merely wonder wtf I did wrong. I guess that if I knew all the
answers, choosing the right path to walk along, and walking it would
be boring, but as it is, it's a wild ride of up's and down's (or an
NT server really hehee, funny fuck I am....)

Saw a great movie a while back... Stimata. Fantastic movie actually,
not anything like what the previews showe it to be. There is a great
theme in the movie that really did mean a lot to me, and there is a
song that is in the movie that I think I can really relate to,
although perhaps sometimes more than I would like to... Thought I
would just post up the words here, as they really do mean a lot to
me, and sometimes they make choosing the path to walk easier for me.

Mary Mary

No virgin me 
For I have sinned 
I sold my soul 
For sex and gin 
Go call a priest 
All meek and mild 
And tell him, "Mary 
Is no more a child." 
It's raining stones 
It's raining bile 
From the luxury 
Of your denial 
So I don't deny 
I don't make do 
I'll press alarms 
Place bets on truth 

I'm so up and down 
And I love what's not allowed 
I was lost, now I see: 
And now I'm growing old 
disgracefully 

Whatever happened to Mary? 

I'll spit on floors 
And do more drugs 
Burn every bill 
Get drunk on love 
Wear next to nothing 
In the pouring rain 
Be a bad example 
And do it all again 

I'll be uncareful 
I'll cause such scenes 
And I'll never talk 
Of used-to-be's 
Tattoo my face 
I won't go grey 
Be a dancing queen 
I'm growing old disgracefully 

I'm so up and down 
And I love what's not allowed 
I was lost, now I see: 
And now I'm growing old 
disgracefully 

Whatever happened to Mary? 

Mary, Mary 
Quite contraryÂ  


Also, I have been listening to Era's self titled album of late, nothing
short of awesome music there. It's an errie mix of orchestral, ambient
and amazing vocals that remind me of the soundtrack to the movie "The
Mission" (also a must hear) or that are near "Vangelis: 1492" in their
sound. A work of true masters.

You know, I think that it's actually worse not to know what is going, than
to know just what is, be it good or bad. I think that's the hardest part of
life. Not knowing where paths will lead, and not being able to see farther
up them than a mere few months in some places, and only a few damned minutes
in others.

Anyways, I guess it's enough for me here, otherwise Alex will be beating
me with a stick saying I write too much, and don't do enough work...
