No project.
Plan:
Well, it's that magic time again...

Another birthday, so it's going to be pretty quiet here for the
next few days, as I will most likely be in hospital working off
the magic hagover that I will no doubt have to inflict on myself...

Zen Tao news? Geoff keeps showing us LD'ers up with his work, and
Jason is just the bomb when it comes to making things look good...
What you saw on the matrox site 

[http://www.matrox.com/mga/3d_gaming/bump/wing_chun.htm]

is really only scratching the surface of what we have got going
here. It's really kick ass'ed to say the least.

Anyways, it's time [takes another shot of Vodka] to continue writing
myself off some more, then trying to work out which gutter I wake up
in.

Have a drink for me, and sing "Happy Birthday" in a really pissed
state and think 22 years...
