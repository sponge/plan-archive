It's been a busy few days, and my car (like me) doesn't like the
heat at all, and told me this by starting to leak from the
radiator... =

On a more serious note, my car is overheating and droppng water
from the radiator, which makes it like me, someonw who hates the
heat.

On a personal matter, my car...

Fook that, it's getting old...

Zen Tao Interactive is doing well for me here, with some good
progress being made. Can't say too much, but shiet, look out
for some awesome schtuff in the not too far future...

In case you missed it, there is a cool interview on GibWorld that
will give a little more awy about what it's like to work for Zen
Tao Interactive, and it also drops a few things about the project.

Interested?
