Nothing like a really bad hangover to get back into the swong of things
is there? In case you were wondering, yes, the birthday party rocked on
well enough. Lots of Vodka, and lots of guarana, and most of all, lots
of dead brain cells after it... ;)

I have to pat the guy's at Egosoft (www.egosoft.com) on the back big time, 
as X-Beyond the Frontier completely 0wns me in the best possible way...

That game is awesome! Of course, not as awesome as what we are doing <g>
but fecking great! The ships, stations, and general feel of the game is 
nothing short of awe inspiring. I haven't had this much fun (and time
dammit) playing a game since Millennium 2.2 came out (Fuck, does that 
give away where I got my nick ;) Hehee) on Amiga, and that was one hell 
of a game... In the meantime, does anyone know how the hell I can make 
a transport vessel (I don't care what sort) carry Crystals to my enegy 
plants, as all the other stations that I have built allow me to set up 
nice transports that will purchase the needed resources on my behalf,
and the stations run completely automonously, however, the damned Solar Plants
require me to lug crystals over in my own ship. I would even be quite happy if
I could get a transport to follow me and make use of 1000+ units of space,
rather then my measly 120... Anyways, enough gibberish... Let's talk shop =)

If you think what it takes to get into the Software Development game
and would be interested in working for a company that has a great
employee (dey fixum mi bard teef!) scheme, and is going to go to places that
other people only dream of sometimes, not to mention working with
some of the coolest people that are about (Humility and Humbleness are
some of my greater points people...) then you should pop me a mail at
tomasz@zentao.unrealengine.com with a link to some of your work, either in
the Unreal Engine, or other such program. I am looking for editors who are
able to generate their own ideas, as well as being able to work with given
tasks. It would be a benefit if you have previous experience in UnrealEd,
but if you don't I won't hold it against you (much that is Hehee).

Please don't send me 20 megs of your "best" work, but a few links would
be great, or a few shots of you aren't currently online anywhere.

The work that is currently on offer is mainly High Polygon design,
but if you think that you can be one of the best Low Poly artists out
there, then we will look at your goods too. This work can be done from
a distant local, so don't worry about moving to another country quite
yet.
