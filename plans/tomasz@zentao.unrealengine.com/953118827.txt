It's funny, how a total stranger can shed new perspectives
on something that goes on inside your head, and no matter how
many angles you look at it from, a completely new outlook can
be only as far as the next person. I guess it's why cabbies
get so many people talk to them. Anyways, a nice soppy thanks
goes out to MacDragon (from www.ozunreal.com) for lending me
an ear for too long (well, prolly more than she wanted to)
today and helping me out when I needed an ear to talk to ;)

Things around here are tight as always, so no huge(ish)
slip'ups can be done without getting a serious ass'kick'en
later from Alex (Yeah, that guy really can kick my ass LOL -
or <mumble> depending on which end I am on) but look for
a totally kickass pressy release of sorts in the
not-to-distant future from either your's truly or one
of the other CrunchMister production line crew members.
