Recently I have heard a lot of people complaining about multiple
patches for games. Sure, it's annoying having to download a new
patch for a program that you bought, and when the number of patches
starts growing in number, it can end up being quite a bit of
downloading (especially on a connection like mine) but I have to
disagree with the complaints.

When a company releases a game, and at a later date, either write
some code or find some bugs and fix them, I think that they are
doing the gaming community a MASSIVE favor by releasing these
patches. It only shows that they are willing to support their
products after they have their kickback from the initial sales.

Sure some people are saying that they are only doing these patches
to get additional sales by being able to say that their game 'now
does xyz' but it's not like they can suddenly put that on the box
of the software is it? It shows dedication, and a willingness to
give the people that bought the software the best value for their
money that they can.
