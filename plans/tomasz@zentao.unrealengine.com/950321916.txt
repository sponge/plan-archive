How may a man measure his own happiness?

He must first go to his cupboard and take out all his neckties.
Then he must lay them out on the groundm end to end.
Then he must measure the length of this line of neckties.
And that measure is exactly the same...
As his distance from True Happiness.

Thought that was fitting as I really hate ties...

It's a great shame and loss to the Unreal Community to see the loss
of one of the sites that started it all on the web, and that is of
course Unreal Nation. The site has been in trouble for a whlie now, 
and also has had a few ressurections (Of which I have been a part of)
but this time, it seems to be "all over".

I salute the guy's there, like Martin and ElDrago who stuck with the
site through good and bad, and also for knowing that it's finaly time
to make the choice they made.

As far as other news goes, there will always be plenty of sites out there
that will pick up the surfers, and I am sure that there will not be a
lack of news to post, but lets just think for a minute about the site
that (for me at least) started it all.

On the Zen Tao front, work is progressing well, and there have been so
many people sending in demo's and requests to me, that I just haven't
gotten back to everyone, but please don't hold that personally. I did go
through all of the mails that I received and checked out all the levels
submitted, as well as checking into more goodies that was linked to.

If I haven't gotten back to you yet, then thankyou for your submission,
and I will keep it here should the need arise for another desinger.
on the team. If I replied to you, and said thanks for submitting - but
you aren't quite ready yet, then feel free to send down more goodies when
you feel that you have reached a better level (And you *will* know) when 
that is the case.

In the meantime, keep your editors open, and may they never crash.
