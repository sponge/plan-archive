Some fantastic lyrics to a song that is popular in the clubs
in Sydney.

===============================================================

What a miracle is life,
The fields are high, the fruit is ripe,
So hold out your hands,
Yeah, hold out your hands,
And you're the same as me,
You breathe the air I breathe,
And we don't understand,
Yeah, we don't understand,

And if you don't ask questions you won't know why,
So say a prayer for the dying while there's still time,
So pray for good and pray for love,
Pray for peace and pray it's enough,
Pray for salvation,
Pray that we're right,
Pray one day we open our eyes, and
Pray for them and pray for us,
Pray one day we can live as one,
Pray for the children whose time is to come,
Just pray they forgive us for the stupid things we've done,

We all see the same sun,
Each day a golden praise is sung,
To the wonder of man,
Yeah, to the wonder of man,
And when we look why can't we see,
All the riches that are free,
Oh we don't understand,
Yeah, we don't understand,

And if you don't ask questions you won't know why,
So say a prayer for the dying while there's still time,
Pray for good and pray for love,
Pray for peace and pray it's enough,
Pray for salvation,
Pray that we're right,
Pray one day we open our eyes, and
Pray for them and pray for us,
Pray one day we can live as one,
Pray for the children whose time is to come,
Just pray they forgive us for the stupid things we've done,

Pray for good and pray for love,
Pray for peace and pray it's enough,
Pray for salvation,
Pray that we're right,
Pray one day we open our eyes, and
Pray for them and pray for us,
Pray one day we can live as one,
Pray for the children whose time is to come,
Just pray they forgive us for the stupid things we've done,

They're rather sad, but I think that if people woke up in the
morning, and heard that, it might make the world a slightly better
place.
