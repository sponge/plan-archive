Project: Extreme Wing Chun VR for Unreal/UT

I made a pretty grim upadte yesterday, and I realy did
forget to mention that it is a relfection of my personal
life, not my work with Zen Tao Interactive. I was just reading
over it at work, thinking that I was quite errr... pissed when
I wrote most of it, and I really did forget to say that my personal
life is what is buggin the shit out of me. Work is going on well
with err... work. (please allow myself to introduce *ugh*
myself - funny fuck I am...)

Anyways, look out for a kickassed announcement sometime in the
near (near is *such* a relative term isn't it? hehee) future and
some kick assed things coming out from the production line we have
here. In case you are wondering, the production line consists of Alex
(making the crunchmisters), Nikki (checking the Crunchmisters for
quality and public relation quality), Neil (making sure that the
Crunchmisters are able to coincide with other Crunchmisters and at
the same time think for themselves while acting in a manner that
allows for a certain level of control), Myself (Errr.... Making
sure that the Crunchmisters are happy in the worlds that we create
for them to live in), Geoff (Who makes gorgeous environments for
the Crunchmisters to live in) and Jason (Who makes scrummy {That's
short for scrumptious} worlds for a select few Crunchmisters to
reside in). All this, and a new guy (Damn, I am shit with names)
who gives all the Crunchmisters an online place to live in and
bask in the glory that we make for the Crunchmisters. Got you
completely lost? Hope so =)

Anyways, much more sober tonight, although still missing the words
of someone that I really would love to hear from (That would be
your cue 'someone' to call me) and looking forward to another
day in the rollercoaster ride of life =|
