I recently read an article dealing with Single player Vs Multi
Player level design. The article said that it ws impossible to
create a story in a Multi Player level, and that they were only
a group of rooms tied together by corridors and doorways.

While I agree that most Multi Player maps are done like that, I
don't agree that it's not possible to tell a story through a DM
level. I think that you just have to be a better story teller...
