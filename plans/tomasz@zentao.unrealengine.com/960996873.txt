Whelp, I think that it's about damned time I updated this file,
and got back into the habit of sending it through it's paces
once in a while.

Things have been hectic here for me, yet at the same time, somehow
strangely distant, like walking in a dream almost. Still, it may
sound somewhat freaky or drug induced, but it's neither of those,
and at the same time it's somehow a nice change. I have cleared
a lot of things up in my life, and things are finally getting
back on track here, although they are still moving slower than
I would have liked them to be moving. I think that this is probably
becuase I seem to think a hell of a lot of steps ahead of where I
am at the current time, and this does make me sometimes lose focus
on what is at hand.

Still, all is going in the right direction, and things seem to be
moving into a better and better drift.

Ciao!

PS - After seeing both Alex' and Neil's posts today I am going to
have to get my hands on one of these puppies and see just what all
the fuss is about.
