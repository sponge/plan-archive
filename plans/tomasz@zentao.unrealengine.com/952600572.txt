7-March-2000

I am learning more and more about happiness and the lack of it.
I used to think that material wealth made happiness. The more I
am learning though, the more I seem to find that it’s the little
and simple things in life that bring more happiness. A walk on
the beach with someone that you care about, an evening spent looking
over a city at night. I am starting to think that life isn’t about
money as much as about what we do with the time that we have here.

I have been spending more time with the people that are close to
me of late, and it has become so much more clear to me that life
isn’t about trying to work every hour of every day, but about working
smarter and hard during the time that we are at work, and enjoying and
cherishing the time that we have to spend outside of work.

By the way, if you didn’t go down to the Sydney gay and Lesbian
Marti Gras on the weekend, you really did yourself a disservice.
The atmosphere was great, and the after party has to go down in
the record books as coming close to the New Years party (although
not quite as big or loud).

It’s actually quite funny though, as I was single, and straight,
and the last place on earth that I thought I would find someone
that I would have a relationship with was that Marti Gras, but as
it was, that’s the place that I met Jumbo, a fantastic person,
beautiful, smiling and happy to be alive. Just another one of life’s
little mysteries I guess.
