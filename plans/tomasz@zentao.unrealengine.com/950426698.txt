Know your Limitations.

I was reading a few good books of late, and found this great 
quote from Chad Freeman of Dreamforge Entertainment.

===============================================================

You deserve to be optimistic, but you need to be hard on 
yourself as well. For "Sanitarium", we tried to identify our
strongest and weakest points as a company and designed the game
with those in mind. One thing that happens in every project is 
that features get cut in order to finish the game. In "Sanitarium",
we designed whole portions of levels that could be cut if necessary, 
without affecting the whole game. When the time came, we were 
prepared, and the game didn't suffer because of it.

===============================================================

I think that if more people followed this philosophy, then there
would be a lot more good games on the market, and at the same time, 
there would be less areas in maps (and games themselves) that the 
player thinks "There was going to be something here..."

Hmmm.... Just checked out Alex's update...

Hey, I can do that too...!

Matrox roolz!

Errrr.... Tomorrow I will update with :

Well, while Matrox is actually a great company, me writing that they
rule really has nothing to do with what I may, or may not, or perhaps
haven't heard, or any other information that may or may not be adherent
to the above statements or conutations...

Wooo!

Now, tomorrow lesson will be how to run *really* fast from Alex wielding
a garlic crusher, and a rolling pin...
