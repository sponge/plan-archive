Just thought that I would put a great email that I
recieved in the mail into this place, as it's really
surprising how accurate it can actually be.

===============================================================

The only survivor of a shipwreck was washed up on a small,
uninhabited island. He prayed feverishly for God to rescue him,
and every day he scanned the horizon for help, but none seemed
forthcoming. Exhausted, he eventually managed to build a little
hut out of driftwood to protect him from the elements, and to
store his few possessions.

But then one day, after scavenging for food, he arrived home
to find his little hut in flames, the smoke rolling up to the
sky. The worst had happened; everything was lost. He was stunned
with grief and anger. "God, how could you do this to me!" he
cried.  Early the next day, however, he was awakened by the
sound of a ship that was approaching the island.

It had come to rescue him.  "How did you know I was here?"
asked the weary man of his rescuers. "We saw your smoke
signal," they replied.

It is easy to get discouraged when things are going bad.
But we shouldn't lose heart, because God is at work in our
lives, even in the midst of pain and suffering. Remember,
next time your little hut is burning to the ground it just
may be a smoke signal that summons the grace of God.  For
all the negative things we have to say to ourselves, God
has a positive answer.

===============================================================

Nice isn't it? Hope it gives youthe little pickup youmight need.
It gave me what I needed that morning. Enjoy your day, do the best
you can - you may never get a chance to do it again!
