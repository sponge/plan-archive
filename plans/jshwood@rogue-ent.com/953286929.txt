Plan:
Since I've been here at Rogue for about 5 months now, I figure 
its about time to start my .plan filings.  Things are cookin'
right along with Alice, and the game seems to be shaping up pretty nicely.

Anyways, I'm headin' down to Austin this weekend to catch Tenacious D at
SXSW.  If anybody, has a chance to see these guys, definitely go see them.

They'll give you the double dip cream dream thrill ride of your life.

Anyways, that's all you bastards are gonna get outta me for now, 
so until next time...
