Ahh... Finally!

After 6..uhm..7.uhm..many months here at ION Storm, the time
has finally come for me to hammer out my First Ever .plan file.

I am a programmer. I work on Anachronox. I've boldly hacked new 
holes in the original QuakeII code. I've put in a quite excellent 
sound library by the name of Miles Sound System (Jeff Roberts 
rule!), I've put in a flexible and cool game data base and hooked 
it up to the actual stats and inventories of the characters. I've 
gotten our in-game music to work through Microsoft's DirectMusic 
and...uhm...

uhm... 

...Hey, guys, help me out here.. I've done something more, haven't I?

Oh, yeah, I just recently infected everyone in the Anox code-corner 
with my fantastic cold, I've discovered Reese's (sp?) chocolate-covered 
peanut butter treats for the first time, ( Yes, that's right. Last 
Tuesday was the first time I tried one of those. See explanation below) 
and I do my best to spread the Gospel according to Lemmy at the office. 
No one around here seem to appreciate Motorhead (the band, not the racing 
game), though, but my mission is NOT over!

Also, I have to admit, I'm from Forreign. Forreign is a country that 
lies outside of the Unites States, (and noone ever really heard about, 
_anyway_, so why bother trying to remember the name of that silly country?) 
and therefore I go by the name of Switz here. (They don't have Reese's 
chocolates over there in Switz)

That's all for tonight... Take care.
