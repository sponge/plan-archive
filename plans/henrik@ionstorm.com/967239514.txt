Following my own "Rule #1" beneath, I'd just like to make a public
statement:

I'm a stupid bitch.


Ok, add another point on my list of rules down there:

- When you make an array of your depth sorted entities so that you will
  be able to draw your translucent alpha entities back-to-front, make
  damn sure that, when you actually decide to draw them, you use the
  right number to index into the array.

We've been struggling with a silly issue of world surfaces with alpha 
that are placed behind entities with alpha in the world are sometimes
drawn on top of the entities. I _thought_ I fixed this 6 months ago
but we've had these weird issues from time to time. Now I found the
error: 

if ( polyZ < zEntDist[zSorted[entity_index]] )

is better than

if ( polyZ < zEntDist[entity_index] )

Trust me. :-)

Thanks. I've just been on a tour of the Anox area of the ION Storm
offices and told every single member of the team that I'm a 
stupid bitch. Now it's your turn, dear reader.

Sorry for my rant. I needed to vent... :-)

Your friendly, neighborhood Stupid Bitch,

A short lesson in "Things most of you already knew":

As a break from making sure the battle system in Anachronox looks 
and plays nice, I decided to dig into our rendering code last night,
as the main model function code looks nasty.

Now, 24 hours later, I look back and I have decided to offer a few pieces 
of advise to all you programmers out there:

<B>1: Don't be stupid.</B>

It can not be stressed enough. Being stupid will hurt you. Your 
code will suck and you will end up hating yourself. A good programmer
should discover in time that he is about to do something very stupid,
and should get back on the smart track real fast.

<B>2: Examine your problem </B>

When you decide to embark upon a cruisade, make sure you know what
you are fighting. If I was to take an example out of thin air, I could
tell you about how 800 lines of code was painfully crafted around one
and just one principle: Hit the Cache. I could also tell you about
the trauma of realizing that your 800 lines of cache-hitting code 
improves performance absolutely ZIPPO. Nada. However, I'm sure nobody 
would want to read about that, so I'll just say: "Make DAMN sure that 
your REAL problem is the same problem as the one you are attacking." 
If it's not, see item 1.

<B>3: So, you think you are Smart? </B>

Sometimes, even the laziest of programmers can realize that "If I do this, 
this, this and this, I can use this super-neato OpenGL API call to do ALL 
my work!". That feeling is usually a great one, especially in this day
and age when graphics hardware does almost everything for you short of 
folding your clothes. However, when you run the supersmart code on your
development machine, you realize that there's probably not a whole lot
of people out there using this "smart" feature, because the frame rate
just dropped like...something that drops a whole lot real fast.
In short, use reasonably "common" features of your graphics card and stay 
away from the fancy and obscure stuff, unless you're really sure that the 
fancy stuff is nice and fast too.

<B>4: A failed optimization is still an experience </B>
There's nothing that will improve your edumacation more than trying to 
understand what the heck you've done wrong. I would like to think that 
I've learned something during these last 24 hours, but maybe that's just
trying to cover my ass from the realization that I suck. :-)

<B>5: I *KNEW* I was RIGHT! </B>
If you're really boneheaded and stubborn, you finally might realize 
that you're doing something pretty dumb and that most of your performance
woes hail from the fact that your "smart" code runs through your cache-
unfriendly data structures TWICE without really needing to. The wonderful, 
wonderful feeling of FINALLY finding your own dumb, correcting it and see 
that "YESS! I got a 10 percent speed increase by doing this." That feeling 
makes it all worth while, and all you now have to do is to apologize to your 
coworkers for having been a complete dick, for having cursed their moms in 
lame ways, etc...

Lessons learned:

- Make your inner loops tight.
- Only rely on API features that you know are usually implemented well in 
  drivers and hardware.
- When developing on the PC, an extra 64k of allocation can be a good friend
  if it boosts performance. 
- Don't be stupid.
- Wishing that all card manufacturers implement all OpenGL API calls in a 
  super-fast and efficient way will not necessarily make it so.

This concludes today's class in "Things most of you already knew".

One hours left until I take off for the Deux Ex release party outside
of Austin. I'll walk around and say "The machinery is susceptible to 
dust particles" and "You don't belong down here", my two lines of
contribution to the Deus Ex project. :-)

Anachronox is indeed a cool project. Expect the unexpected. Even in
real life, things happen that seem highly unlikely. Like the other
day, I hear Tom go "Whaaat?!?!". I turn around, and, lo and behold,
in Tom's office stands Joey Liaw! The boy wonder! Well, ok, not "stands".
Infact, he was sitting on Squirrel, who had taken a creative, 
deeply meditative nap on Tom's couch. He will join us for a few more
months! Good news indeed! (Hehe, he's already taken a couple of
bugs off my list and attacked them with a feverish frenzy. He
has missed us all so! ;-)

Other good news on the Anochronox front: After a short step back
for contemplation, we've rapidly gained new ground with our sweet, sweet
battle system. The last few days has seen rapid development in the
areas of battle skills, and most of them are now completely generic,
only defined in our game object database. Not only will energetic people
like you, the die-hard Anox fan, be able to create new worlds, populate
them with your own characters, add in quests and your own battles, you 
can also construct your own battle skills for your player characters. 
And here I thought that hard coding was a must at some point in game
development :-)

Anyhow, that's all for now. Anox is happy.

A swift update on the silly, patriotic, Swedish side. 
Klaus Lyngeled (of Shiny Entertainment) and I were 
featured on the IT pages of Aftonbladet, one of Sweden's
biggest daily newspapers, as "The Swedes behind the
hottest games". Hehe. Swedes rule! ;-)

Nuff of the "Ego Boost of the Day"...

Anachronox is progressing and the environmental sound effects
needs some swift whacks with the Debug Hammer (working on 
that right now). Also, after having installed Windows 2000 
on my dual machine at home, Anox has undergone some dual-CPU tests 
and have come up on the winning side. It will run a few notches 
faster on a dual machine, since a few of the external systems 
(sounds, DirectMusic, and a few other things) run as separate 
threads. The main renderer, though, is single-threaded so the 
leap in FPSs won't scale linearly. Oh well. No surprise.

All in all, life is good in AnoxVille. 

    "My your railgun stand between you and harm in 
     all the dark places you must go."

So, E3 is over. The Switz'n'Eva Production team went to E3
to check things out. There were PLENTY of goodies to look
at, but to keep intra-team relations at a reasonable level,
Switz reports that he tried to restrict his oogling to 
computer related products. Reportedly, he managed to keep 
the drooling over fine Californian flesh to a minimum. (Yeah,
right.) 

MGS2 looked downright AWESOME! Oh my god, yes, I want to see
more of that! I'm also happy that some people rated Anachronox 
very very high..(Come ON?!? 9.3?!? :-) and it resulted in a
spontaneous round of applause in our team meeting yesterday.

Unfortionately, due to development complications, Switz'n'Eva's
Project Tiny has been postsponed. The release date for Project 
Tiny had to be readjusted. The Team still thinks that a 9 month 
development cycle will be required, but forces beyond the 
development team's control resulted in a premature cancellation
of the project and the already existing code base can not be
re-used when the development cycle is initiated the next time.

Sounds weird, but apparently, that's how Mother Nature, everyone's
ultimate Publisher, sets things up.

The development team would like to thank everyone that sent us
"Good Luck" wishes at the announcement of Project Tiny, and
we are also sorry to have to make our fan base[1] wait even longer
for the Projects release. We're both doing ok, so don't worry :-)

Have a great summer, you all!!

About 9 weeks ago, Switz'n'Eva Productions Inc, started 
development on their latest project, Project Tiny. Tiny 
will feature real-time light reflections, advanced sound 
output and most likely a highly sophisticated DirectSmell 
interface. Yours truly also have high hopes for the dynamic 
and very strong AI functionality that the code base supports.

A spokesperson for Project Tiny say that the estimated 
development cycle will be 40 weeks, or 9 months and given 
the current schedule, there is nothing that prevents a 
timely release. 

An early estimate says that Project Tiny will be going Gold 
on November 22, 2000. Inspite of demands from the public, 
there will be no playable demo out before that date. 
Eventually a few screenshots might be presented to the 
general public as development continues.

So far, there is nothing in the design that prevents 
Project Tiny from being a multiplayer game, but this 
might be subject to change as more is publicly known 
about the Project.

Also, at this early stage, no base requirements are known. 
The production team estimates that the game might require 
a few patches after the initial release, and lets us know 
that initially the game might require a lot of attention to 
run smoothly. However, the production company has a firm
belief that the final result will have a positive result 
on the global community.

My head hurts. Yesterday, I found a VCR tape in my cube, starring 
Richard Simmons, called "Dance your Pants Off - An Aerobic Concert". 
It's featuring such aerobic hits as "Celebration", "She works Hard 
For The Money", "Total Eclipse of the Heart" and "The Rose". 

Ok, I grant you all that I'm not all that into aerobic workout, 
but how in the blessed name of Bad Language can you do aerobic 
workout to "The Rose"? 

Come to think of it... I don't want to know. Do not tell me and 
do NOT send any pictures or movies showing this off, ok? There's a 
limit to what I can take. I have one tape showing it already, and 
I do not intend to watch it.

Someone, somewhere asked me who my favorite smurf is. That's 
simple: GodSmurf, the Blue Belgian Bastard. Thanks, dude.

To get this mildly on track: Anachronox is exciting. Really exciting. 
I'm currently working on optimizing the way we load and start up our 
in-engine cinematics. If we get them to start off just a tad smoother, 
it might elevate the game experience a few more notches.

The 3D sound system is now operational, with a few more niceness-tweaks
left to implement, and hardware occlusion will be supported, inspite of
Aureal's Chapter 11. 

The programming team has hit a wonderfully effective pace and there's
light at the end of the tunnel, so...

Things will be good and life will be beautiful.

Ahh... Finally!

After 6..uhm..7.uhm..many months here at ION Storm, the time
has finally come for me to hammer out my First Ever .plan file.

I am a programmer. I work on Anachronox. I've boldly hacked new 
holes in the original QuakeII code. I've put in a quite excellent 
sound library by the name of Miles Sound System (Jeff Roberts 
rule!), I've put in a flexible and cool game database and hooked 
it up to the actual stats and inventories of the characters. I've 
got our in-game music to work through Microsoft's DirectMusic 
and...uhm...

uhm... 

...Hey, guys, help me out here.. I've done something more, haven't I?

Oh, yeah, I just recently infected everyone in the Anox code-corner 
with my fantastic cold, I've discovered Reese's (sp?) chocolate-covered 
peanut butter treats for the first time, ( Yes, that's right. Last 
Tuesday was the first time I tried one of those. See explanation below) 
and I do my best to spread the Gospel according to Lemmy at the office. 
No one around here seem to appreciate Motorhead (the band, not the racing 
game), though, but my mission is NOT over!

Also, I have to admit, I'm from Forreign. Forreign is a country that 
lies outside of the Unites States, (and noone ever really heard about, 
_anyway_, so why bother trying to remember the name of that silly country?) 
and therefore I go by the name of Switz here. (They don't have Reese's 
chocolates over there in Switz)

That's all for tonight... Take care.
