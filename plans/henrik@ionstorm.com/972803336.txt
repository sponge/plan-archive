I love technology. 

I guess 100 percent of you people reading this do too, but I'm not
gonna let that fact hold me down. The object of my geek desire has 
been elusive for over 6 months, but she has finally returned my love. 

She's blue, she's got a nice LCD display, she stores 1200 of my 
MP3s without complaining and she fits in a decent sized pocket. 

She's my Jukebox. 

I spent 4 hours yesterday, feeding her with a varied mix of the 
finest nutrients, such as Dio, A Tribe Called Quest, Sarah Vaughn,
Exodus, LOK (swedish band), Ministry, Motorhead, Mozart, Rammstein
and The Reverend Horton Heat. I have fed her 42 albums, 488 tracks 
and still she's not even half full. 

I'm so HAPPY!

In other news:

- Added a weird subtractive lighting effect to the renderer. Not sure if it's
  very good, but let's see what the artists can do with it. They're the ones
  with the imagination, not me ;-)

- Finished my re-read of Eiji Yoshikawa's "Musashi". Fine book indeed. It taught
  me to ignore concepts like "winning" and "losing". It helped me beat down
  Joey, so I give you:
