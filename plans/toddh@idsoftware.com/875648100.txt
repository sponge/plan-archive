Another honor has been bestowed upon id Software.  
The Red Herring has named us to its 1997 list of 
the "Top 100 Technology Companies".  The magazine has
this to say about the list:

"The Herring 100 lists the one hundred brightest stars 
in the digital firmament. These are, we believe, the 
companies that define the digital universe."

WOW!  That is hefty praise.

The Red Herring isn't much of a "gamer's magazine", 
but it is a very respected publication in the high 
technology field, which prides itself on coverage of 
upwardly mobile companies.  I say this to frame what
it means to be included on their Top 100 list.  

You can see the full list and story here:

...I think I'll put the article next to the Quake II 
ad once we get *both* of them framed...

If you've read Kevin's .plan file, you already know
that Hexen II sales have been incredible.  Now I'm
starting to see the full game reviews posted on the
Net and they are equally as rosy.  Raven, id, and
Activision worked very hard to make Hexen II an
excellent game, so its nice to see the reviewers
appreciate it and are having fun playing the game.
Its still early, but Hexen II is shaping up to be
Raven's best game ever.

New Deal of the Week:  October issue of PC Gamer.  It 
should be easy to spot on the shelves with the big
QII right on the cover.  Its a really thick issue with 
tons of Quake II screenshots, interviews, scoop, etc.  
If you don't have a copy yet, you should go pick one up.

Another magazine you might want to check out is the 
November issue of Computer Games.  The new
Quake II cover ad is in it, replete with concept art by
Adrian Carmack.  We've had some cool ads before, but 
this one takes the cake.  I'd buy the magazine so I 
could get a copy of the ad.  We're getting some prints
done of the ad, one of which I intend to hang on one of
the bare walls in my office.

Think I'll try to get Adrian to sign mine. ;)
