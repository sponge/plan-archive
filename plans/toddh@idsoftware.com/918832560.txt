I'm still getting used to "99" as the date.
Y2K bug issues notwithstanding, I wonder if
accepted business practice for signature
dating legal documents will be xx/xx/00, or
if we will just use a single zero.

Anyway, the reason I'm updating my .plan file
is:

QUAKE II Action Figure Update

I have received a number of emails asking if
these are available and where they could be
bought.  Kay Bee toys carries them and should
have a significant supply.  EB also has them,
although they are already sold out of the
Tank figure.  I understand that they are in,
or on their way to ToysRUs.  For the Net shoppers,
www.ebworld.com sells them for $9.99, as well as
a bunch of other cool game related toys (Duke
figures, Lara Croft, Resident Evil, Southpark, etc).
EBWorld is out of the Tank figure, too, but I'm
sure they'll have more as soon as ReSaurus can 
make them :)  If you want some more info on the 
figures, you can check them out at www.resaurus.com
or just go to our website and click on the action
figure icon on the front page.

I'll make a plug for these figures, and ReSaurus
in general:  These are top qualtiy.  The Tank 
figure weighs 3 pounds!  And he has lots of cool
touches, like firing rockets, working gears in his
leg, and very detailed art.  A Marine, Female Marine,
and Iron Maiden are available (in addition to the 
Tank), and all of them come with cool extra stuff
like the Barracuda Shark, or the Technician, or
the Parasite, and their weapons, of course.
