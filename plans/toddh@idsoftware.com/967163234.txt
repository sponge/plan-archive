I've had several requests for information about the Q3A port to PS2, so
I'm just going to put the generic info here:

It's being done by EA and does involve some of their London employees (Bullfrog),
but other people from other teams are involved as well.  The release date is 
"when it's done", but everyone knew that already ;-)  It's still very early in 
the development process so we are still exploring what we can add to the PS2 
version and what it's limitations will be.  Our goal with the game will be to make
a fun game for PS2 players, but not necessarily mirror what is available on the 
DC or PC.  As on all ports of our games, we will oversee the development process.

There will be more detailed information available as time goes on, but we're 
excited about getting started and seeing what all can be accomplished.

QuakeCon 2000 is looking *really* impressive.  I don't know if it's going
to be the largest LAN party ever, but it's got to be close to it.  They're
still setting up the sponsor area, but it looked great last night.  I'm 
looking forward to seeing everyone who comes down and I hope you all
have a great time.

Congrats to Ritual.  We've been playing a bit of FAKK 2 over here
between wrapping up Team Arena, prepping for QuakeCon 2000, and starting
DOOM.  There's going to be a number of Quake 3 engine titles coming out 
over the next few months that I'm really looking forward to.  FAKK2, Elite
Force and Alice are all looking like outstanding games.

If you're coming down for QuakeCon, most people will be pleased to know
that it shouldn't be quite as hot this year as it was last year.  It's still
the summer in Texas, but the forecast is for mid-90's instead of every
day being 104+ like last summer.  With a little bit of a breeze it's not
that bad.  Honest.
