QuakeCon 2000 is looking *really* impressive.  I don't know if it's going
to be the largest LAN party ever, but it's got to be close to it.  They're
still setting up the sponsor area, but it looked great last night.  I'm 
looking forward to seeing everyone who comes down and I hope you all
have a great time.

Congrats to Ritual.  We've been playing a bit of FAKK 2 over here
between wrapping up Team Arena, prepping for QuakeCon 2000, and starting
DOOM.  There's going to be a number of Quake 3 engine titles coming out 
over the next few months that I'm really looking forward to.  FAKK2, Elite
Force and Alice are all looking like outstanding games.

If you're coming down for QuakeCon, most people will be pleased to know
that it shouldn't be quite as hot this year as it was last year.  It's still
the summer in Texas, but the forecast is for mid-90's instead of every
day being 104+ like last summer.  With a little bit of a breeze it's not
that bad.  Honest.
