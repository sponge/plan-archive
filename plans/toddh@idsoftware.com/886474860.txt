Congrats to Thresh for the PGL victory.  It's
too bad I couldn't be there to see it live.
The tournament sounded incredibly exciting
with Reptile's "upset" of Thresh in the early 
rounds and then Thresh coming back under what
must have been tremendous pressure.  Some
may argue over whether playing Quake is a
proper sport, but I would guess that in the 
rounds leading up to the finals the pressure
was as intense as a pro golf tournament.  Given
that each deathmatch is so different, I think
it is really amazing that Thresh manages to 
consistently come out on top.

The PGL isn't without its share of faults, but 
I think they pulled off a successful first 
season.  They learned a lot and should be
improved for their second season.  At the very 
least, lots of Quake players got to compete for 
some pretty significant prizes and got to be in 
the spotlight for a while, which isn't bad at all.
