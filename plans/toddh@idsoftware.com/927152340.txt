This update is relevant only for all magazines, CD bundlers,
coverdisk makers, and shareware bundlers.

I have been getting a number of requests for permission to 
include the Q3Test on various types of CD's.  Please note
that this is expressly prohibited in the End User License 
Agreement for Q3Test.  The test is to be redistributed by 
electronic means *only*.  That means no CD coverdisks, no CD 
"shareware" compilations, no zip disk distribution, or any 
other form of distribution other than Internet mirrors and
other means of electronic file transfer.

We have been very clear that this test is not meant for
mass public distribution and should NOT be considered a
"demo".  The "demo" will come when it's done.

If you have any questions about the policy, you may email
me at toddh@idsoftware.com.
