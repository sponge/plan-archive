Software pirates beware:

Also, if you are running a "cracked" Wolf server, or are posting links to these
servers, don't be surprised if you are contacted in the near future about this
behavior.  Fair warning - you are not anonymous and we *do* look at those IP
addresses.  

It's a simple thing to just run a Test server instead if you don't want to pay 
for the game or can't afford it or just want people to be able to come and play 
on your server without having to buy the game.  Besides, at $30, it's cheap (see
my 12/9 update below).

Killing Nazis and saving the world from Himmler's evil plans is now on SALE! ;-)

Just saw the circular ads this Sunday.  CompUSA has RTCW for $39.99 and Circuit
City has the game on sale for a downright CHEAP! price of $29.99.  Folks, $30 is
a deal I doubt you'll see again for a while and some people were paying twice that
the day the game came out (the Suggested Retail Price is $49.99, btw). 

As I've stated before, most of the retailers will price match these days, so if 
either of these retailers isn't convenient, you might want to pick up a Sunday paper 
with the ads to get these deals in your favorite store.

[Query:  Do the online reviews that criticized the game because of the price have to 
now be re-written?]
