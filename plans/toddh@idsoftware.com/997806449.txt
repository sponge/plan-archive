Wow!  QuakeCon 2001 was the best one ever without any doubt.  We're still
recovering from all of the festivities and events.  Thanks to everyone 
who came out and made it a huge success and a great time.  Thanks
especially to the sponsors:  nVidia, Apple, AMD, LinkSys, Activision and 
Discreet.

It's been cool to see all of the great news reports about the LAN party, the 
games that were on display, John's talk and demo of DOOM, and the results 
of the nVidia Quake 3 Arena tournament.

We're looking forward to the challenge of making it even bigger and better
next year!

QuakeCon 2K1 starts tomorrow!  This year QuakeCon is really shaping up
to be the biggest and best we've ever had.  From the announcements, to
the games that will be shown, to the sponsors, to the huge LAN, to the
tourney (and party following), we've really got a lineup that's going
to be amazing.  Everyone who's coming down better get ready to have a 
good time.

We're in the final stages of preparation now, but I'm looking forward to
seeing everyone tomorrow and over the weekend.  It's gonna be a fun one!
