Adrian and I were checking out our local Electronics Boutique
and we spotted the QII action figures out on the shelves for
$2.99 for all of the figures except for the Tank, which was 
$7.99.  I know a bunch of people have been looking for these
(especially the Tanks, which were so hard to find), so here's 
a chance to get them on the cheap.  Adrian bought a Tank figure,
since we only have a couple in the office.  We were amazed that 
they had the Tank figures in, and at less than 8 bucks it was 
just too cheap to pass up.

Also, Quake II for the N64 is now out.  EB had at least one copy
in that had arrived this morning

This update is relevant only for all magazines, CD bundlers,
coverdisk makers, and shareware bundlers.

I have been getting a number of requests for permission to 
include the Q3Test on various types of CD's.  Please note
that this is expressly prohibited in the End User License 
Agreement for Q3Test.  The test is to be redistributed by 
electronic means *only*.  That means no CD coverdisks, no CD 
"shareware" compilations, no zip disk distribution, or any 
other form of distribution other than Internet mirrors and
other means of electronic file transfer.

We have been very clear that this test is not meant for
mass public distribution and should NOT be considered a
"demo".  The "demo" will come when it's done.

If you have any questions about the policy, you may email
me at toddh@idsoftware.com.
