On my way to grab a Coke, I saw something I thought you folks 
might find entertaining:

As many people know, we collect articles that feature id and/or
our games and have them framed to hang up around the office.  We 
also do this with the some of the various awards the games have won
that come in the form of certificates (as opposed to trophies
or plates).  In the break room one of the certificates is from
Game Byte Magazine (aside:  where are they now?).  It's a 
"Readers' Choice" award giving DOOM "Honorable Mention" for 1993 
Action/Arcade Game of the Year.  

Yes, you read it right: "Honorable Mention" =) Talk about missing 
the mark.

I looked at it and just had to laugh.  We probably put it up by 
mistake in the first place (since we only hang the awards we actually 
win, as opposed to coming in 3rd or 4th place on), and in that *very 
same room* are 4 other "Readers'" award certificates from PC Gamer for 
DOOM for 1993: Best Technical Achievement, Best Graphics, Best Arcade 
Game, and Best Overall Game.

Magazines going in different directions...

Bargain shopping update:

Best Buy is selling Quake III Arena for $39.99 this week.
It's advertised in their Sunday circular ad, so if you don't
like Best Buy, you can always take the ad to one of those
"we'll match any price" stores and get the same deal.
