I just received word from the Mplayer Store folks that they've
put Quake III Arena on sale for $31.99.  That's the cheapest price
I've seen so far and you might not see it that low for a while.

The page shows $49.99 but it's $31.99 once you "add to cart".

Oh, almost forgot:  Kevin, Graeme and I were just in the middle of 
the bank robbery + car chase that was broadcast not only locally, but 
evidently was unusual enough to interrupt even California TV shows
(where high speed car chases are the norm and you usually have to 
a celebrity or sports star involved to make it interesting ;-)
The suspects were apprehended in the Town East Mall while we ate
lunch and about a dozen helicopters circled overhead.

If anyone is still looking for a Q3A tin box edition, Activision
recently release the last of their inventory.  Fry's has a bunch 
of them and other retailers like Best Buy and CompUSA will have
a few of them, but you may have to look around a bit.  Get them 
while you can because they'll probably go pretty fast.  I think 
the entire shipment was 10K units and this is the last production 
run of the special box.
