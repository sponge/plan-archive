Warning:  Upcoming shameless plug for a business 
partner of ours!

Anyone interested in Quake or Quake II keychains,
money clips, necklaces, pins, or basically 
anything cool that can be made out of metal
(within reason) should check out www.qvt.com.
Those guys are huge Quake/Quake II fans and do
Quake jewelry in their spare time.  The quality
is really nice and the stuff is affordable, too.
They do custom stuff (including silver and gold)
so you can get something personalized for your 
girl/boyfriend, husband, wife, clanmates, whatever.  
It's definitely worth checking out.

Oh, I also hear that if you're having a tournament
with at least 250 people, they'll send you a cool
plaque for no charge (you have to inquire with those
guys about all of the details).
