From April 8, 2000 New York Times article "Rampage Killers:  A Statistical 
Portrait" by Ford Fessenden:

	They [the killers] are not racists or Satanists or addicited to 
	violent video games, movies or music.

It's amazing how the tides of media coverage can turn so quickly when they
quit focusing on the hype and hysteria and instead scrutinize the facts.

I just received outstanding news for not only id, but the video game industry
as well:  

In a decision that has just been made available, id has prevailed in
the Paducah lawsuit (more formally known as the "James Case") on all points.  
Judge Johnstone has dismissed the case on all grounds, validating what we have 
said all along:  the case lacked a shred of merit.

Thanks for the enormous positive feedback on my interview with John Stossil.
I'm fortunate to have had the opportunity to present what I believe is the sane,
rational, and correct point-of-view.  The support of the game community is
greatly appreciated.
