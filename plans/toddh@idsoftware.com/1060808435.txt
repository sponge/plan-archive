Here it is already time for QuakeCon 2003.  While the festivities officially start on Thursday there are quite a few folks already helping with setting up what will be the biggest QuakeCon ever.  It looks like the weather is going to give us a break this year and we'll mark the first QuakeCon I can remember where we won't hit 100 degrees.

New for this year will be the location in Downtown Dallas at the Adam's Mark Hotel and Conference Center which gives us tons more room for more cool stuff.  And our sponsors are really outdoing themselves to help us make sure that everyone that comes out sees cool new games and gear, has a good time, and probably picks up some free stuff, too.

The BYOC will be the biggest yet, with room for up to 2000 PCs.  The reservation list is booked up, but first-come-first-serve starts Thursday afternoon if you didn't get on the list.  The keynote is Friday afternoon, and tournament finals, awards ceremony and party are all Saturday night.  But the fragging is non-stop Thursday to Sunday 24 hours a day.

And, of course, we will be unveiling DOOM 3 multiplayer for the first time.  And everyone will be able to play it, too.

For more information, details, directions, etc. the website is www.quakecon.org.  There's no charge to attend, so come on out.  I look forward to seeing everyone there this year.
