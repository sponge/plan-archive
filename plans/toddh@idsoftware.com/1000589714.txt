Since there seems to be some confusion as to the timing of the Wolf Multiplayer
TEST, just a quick note to let everyone know that it should be up in the next 
hour or so, or around 5 PM CST.  We're setting up some servers here to monitor 
the initial feedback.

Have fun everyone!

Also, a quick brag that while I was on trip week before last, Adrian Carmack and I
managed to play the first GBA DOOM deathmatch at DFW Airport and also on the plane
with what was a final build of the game (which is now off to manufacturing).

I think the flight attendants were a bit aggravated by the link cable being run across
the isle but it was tons 'o fun.

My sympathy goes out to the victims and families of the cowardly attack Tuesday.
