Congratulations to our RTCW partners Gray Matter and Nerve on the Academy of
Interactive Arts and Sciences awards for Best Online Game and Computer Action/
Adventure Game of the Year for Return to Castle Wolfenstein!

If you've been waiting for a post-Christmas opportunity to get in on the fun, I
saw yesterday that Best Buy has RTCW on sale this week for just $34.99.  That's
the best deal I've seen in quite a while.  The price was in a circular ad, so if
there's not a Best Buy that's convenient, you might try getting another retailer
to price match for you (most of them will, if you ask).

I've had a few questions about the price of private Quake II engine licensing
now that we have released the source under the GPL.  We're doing the same 
thing with Quake II that we did with the Quake engine and reducing the price 
to a flat $10,000 if you want to keep your source code proprietary.  You're not
required to pay the fee if you abide by the GPL, of course.  But some people
have been interested in maintaining their own source and not releasing it, so
we offer this option as an alternative.  The technology licensing page on our 
website will be updated to reflect this after the start of the new year.
