I just received word from the Mplayer Store folks that they've
put Quake III Arena on sale for $31.99.  That's the cheapest price
I've seen so far and you might not see it that low for a while.

The page shows $49.99 but it's $31.99 once you "add to cart".

If anyone is still looking for a Q3A tin box edition, Activision
recently release the last of their inventory.  Fry's has a bunch 
of them and other retailers like Best Buy and CompUSA will have
a few of them, but you may have to look around a bit.  Get them 
while you can because they'll probably go pretty fast.  I think 
the entire shipment was 10K units and this is the last production 
run of the special box.
