Today is moving day for id.  That's right, we're vacating the "Black Cube"
for a new building that's not very far from our current office.  Email, 
telephone, web site, etc. may have intermittent problems over the weekend.
Other than that, we're all pretty happy to be getting into new office space
for the first time in about 7 years.

I think Christian may be posting some info related to transition of the
master servers, authorization server, etc.
