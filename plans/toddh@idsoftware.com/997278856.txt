QuakeCon 2K1 starts tomorrow!  This year QuakeCon is really shaping up
to be the biggest and best we've ever had.  From the announcements, to
the games that will be shown, to the sponsors, to the huge LAN, to the
tourney (and party following), we've really got a lineup that's going
to be amazing.  Everyone who's coming down better get ready to have a 
good time.

We're in the final stages of preparation now, but I'm looking forward to
seeing everyone tomorrow and over the weekend.  It's gonna be a fun one!

If you're a professional or amateur game development team, you should
take a look at this.  It's a reference document for our technology
licensing program and contains a ton of information.
