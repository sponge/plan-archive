Killing Nazis and saving the world from Himmler's evil plans is now on SALE! ;-)

Just saw the circular ads this Sunday.  CompUSA has RTCW for $39.99 and Circuit
City has the game on sale for a downright CHEAP! price of $29.99.  Folks, $30 is
a deal I doubt you'll see again for a while and some people were paying twice that
the day the game came out (the Suggested Retail Price is $49.99, btw). 

As I've stated before, most of the retailers will price match these days, so if 
either of these retailers isn't convenient, you might want to pick up a Sunday paper 
with the ads to get these deals in your favorite store.

[Query:  Do the online reviews that criticized the game because of the price have to 
now be re-written?]
