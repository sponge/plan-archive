I've seen posts on several Quake II news sites that
there is a new commercial product "bundled" with 
Quake II.  First, this is not true.  There is
nothing bundled with Quake II other than the manual
and some promotional dropcards.  Of course, most of
you know that since you've bought the game already ;)
(thanks again, btw).  Second, this product is not
in any way affiliated, authorized, or licensed by
us, since we haven't even seen it yet.  I'm not sure
where the "bundled" story got started, but just wanted
to stop it before it got out of hand.

We should be releasing some exciting news tomorrow
about our first Quake II Mission Pack.  Once the press
release is finalized, I'll make an announcement here.
