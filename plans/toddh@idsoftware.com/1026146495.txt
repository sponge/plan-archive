I've had a few questions about the price of private Quake II engine licensing
now that we have released the source under the GPL.  We're doing the same 
thing with Quake II that we did with the Quake engine and reducing the price 
to a flat $10,000 if you want to keep your source code proprietary.  You're not
required to pay the fee if you abide by the GPL, of course.  But some people
have been interested in maintaining their own source and not releasing it, so
we offer this option as an alternative.  The technology licensing page on our 
website will be updated to reflect this after the start of the new year.
