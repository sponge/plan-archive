We are now taking pre-orders via 1-800-IDGAMES. 
We'll have a banner/page up on the id website 
soon, but I wanted to go ahead and make the 
announcement here.  The cost is $49 plus shipping
($5 for domestic packages for normal delivery).  
So if you want your own little copy of Quake II 
delivered to your doorstep (i.e., no fighting 
Christmas crowds, waiting in line at EB, or whatever 
else bugs you about retail) give our operators a 
call.  We'll ship the game as soon as we get our 
copies, which will probably be Monday or Tuesday of 
next week.

More release date info:

Activision anticipates being on the shelves in
the UK around December 12.  There aren't any
other specific dates (apart from North America)
at this point other than worldwide distribution 
should occur by mid-December.

Also, thanks to all those who have sent notes
congratulating us on the release and wishing us
well.  We appreciate the sentiment.

ATTENTION: Official Release Date Info!

I just spoke with Activision and the current
projection is that Quake II will be at a 
retailer near you (if you live in the U.S. or
Canada) by Tuesday the 9th.  I'm still waiting 
on release dates outside of North America but
those should be forthcoming.

As you've probably read from Carmack's .plan,
we are finally "golden", as it were.  This on
the same day that I get my copy of PC Gamer
(UK editition) that proclaims Quake II as
"THE BEST GAME EVER!".  No emphasis added - 
none needed.  This is legitimately the first 
full review of the game and the piece is not
only flattering, but well written.  Statements
like "QUAKE II is far and away [id's] finest
hour - everything about it oozes perfection"
make me want to run out an pre-order a copy 
myself.

Before everyone emails us asking when they 
can get a copy in stores, we're waiting to hear
from Activision ouselves as to when they think 
they can get it out.  So send them lots of email 
begging them to get it out NOW! ;)
