Yesterday I decided it was time for a .plan update (haven't had one in some
time now), but I couldn't think of anything to say.  So I asked an Orz if he
wanted to do an update for me, and he agreed.  Unfortunately Orz-to-English
translation technology isn't that great, so I can't really pretend to
understand exactly what he's saying.  I'll just post the translation as-is,
and let you make of it what you will.

" Hello! Hello! Orz are saying hello, and *spitting* the *pretty colors* in
plan file!  Too much enjoyment!  *Silly campers* can *smell* plan file in the
*now space* even though Orz *spits* in the *then space*.  It is a *game*
over many *pieces*.  I am *anticipating* extra fun!  *Squishy piece games*
are the best *games*, more than several.  Plan file *playground* is better
to *enjoy the sauce*, since there is no *jumping in front*.  It is such a
*squishy town*, with many *parties* for more *smiley time*, this is the case!
Better *parties* means no *lonely bubbles*.  This is the everything story! "

Umm... okay.
