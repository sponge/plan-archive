Gold!

Well I've got some good news and some bad news.  Good news is that we
have someone that we'd like you to meet.  A teenage girl who doesn't
back away from trouble, shoulders a bit of an attitude and is
definitely not one to hide in the shadows.  Her name is Alice and you
will be able to meet her on December 5th.

The bad news is: The game is gold.  It's been a long road getting here
and it's very unusual to let something this near and dear to go, but
it was time.  You have all been extremely patient and supportive and
we cannot thank you all enough for the support and excitement that has
been communicated to us.  We hope that you enjoy the game as much as
we have making it and that Alice finds her way through the twisted
passages of Wonderland with your help!

Thanks to all and have a great holiday season!
