Well, a HUGE congrats to our friends over at Ritual. FAKK is Gold and I'm sure
that we'll not hear from the tribe for at least a week as they all recover! ;)

Now, send us a copy, ya?

To the 'Lord.  I too about misinformation in the press.

The Baron. :) 


Ok guys, gals and all of you professional designer types.  The position for a
new designer here on 'the ship' is still open.  Read on for more info.

Level Designers

Rogue Entertainment is looking to expand our design team with experienced,
dedicated, and team-oriented individuals to help us bring to life Alice and
any other future mischief. 

Required Skills:

1. A driven, self-starter who enjoys the commitment and rewards of creating
entertainment software.

2. Extensive experience in game/level design.

3. Experience with the Quake2 and/or Quake3 technology and editing tools.

Being an avid gamer with a passion for puzzles and problem solving is
desirable.  Also, prior experience in other technologies is a plus, but
professional experience with Quake2 and/or Quake3 is a must.  Applicants
should be proficient with QERadiant and be able to hit the ground running
from day one.  If you feel you are an _absolute wizard_ of level design and
do not have professional experience, we might consider your work.

Any interested and qualified applicants should please send their resume and
demo materials to:

Rogue Entertainment, Inc.
Attn: Jim Molinets
4514 Travis Street, Suite 205
Dallas, TX, 75205
