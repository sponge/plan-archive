Well, it's been a while since I updated, but I simply have to take my
proverbial hat off to Valve for Half-Life.  In no uncertain terms, this game
is incredible!  I have to echo the statement from Robs' where he says that
Half-Life raises the bar for FPS's to come.  Congratulations, and thanks
to all of you, great job!
