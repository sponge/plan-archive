Well, I survived E3.  Still battle-scarred, but I think I'm awake again. ;)

I just wanted to take a sec here and tell everyone that came to see Alice,
thanks for your support.  It's always great, as a developer, for us to
get such an overwhelming positive response.

Also, I wanted to extend some congratulations to our friends over at Ensemble
Studios for picking up PC Game of the Year at the show.  Kick-ass, and keep
up the great work!
