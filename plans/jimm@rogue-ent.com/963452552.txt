Well, hot on the heels of Rich's announcement of the cut-off for the texture
artist comes my post for more help wanted here at the Rogue Palace (tm).

Level Designers

Rogue Entertainment is looking to expand our design team with experienced,
dedicated, and team-oriented individuals to help us bring to life Alice and
any other future mischief. 

Required Skills:

1. A driven, self-starter who enjoys the commitment and rewards of creating
entertainment software.

2. Extensive experience in game/level design.

3. Experience with the Quake2 and/or Quake3 technology and editing tools.

Being an avid gamer with a passion for puzzles and problem solving is
desirable.  Also, prior experience in other technologies is a plus, but
professional experience with Quake2 and/or Quake3 is a must.  Applicants
should be proficient with QERadiant and be able to hit the ground running
from day one.  If you feel you are an _absolute wizard_ of level design and
do not have professional experience, we might consider your work.

Any interested and qualified applicants should please send their resume and
demo materials to:

Rogue Entertainment, Inc.
Attn: Jim Molinets
4514 Travis Street, Suite 205
Dallas, TX, 75205

Note: submissions WILL NOT be returned.

US residents only, please.  We do not currently have internship positions
available.  Rogue Entertainment, Inc. is an equal opportunity employer.
