Well, I will have to break tradition here and update twice in one month. ;)

I was looking at the calendar and today is Dec. 15th.  Well, I am going to
put on my 'way back' helmet and head back 5 years ago, yesterday.
A little company by the name of Rogue Entertainment was founded!

It's been a wonderful 5 years, filled with interesting people and projects.
I wouldn't trade any of the trials, tribulations, fun, failures and
successes for any other job on the planet.  Well maybe for Porn, but that
would be it! :)

I would also like to thank all of those who have made Rogue and it's
products the success(es) it/they have been:
James Monroe, Tim Willits, Steve Tietze, Steve Thoms, Berenger Fish, Won Choi
and Patrick Magruder.

And those who are now part of the team now:
Rich Fleider, Steve Maines, Peter Mack, Cameron Lamprecht, Rob Selitto,
Bear Alexander, Chris Greenhaw, Brandon James, Aaron Smith, Jay Brushwood,
John Turner and Bobby Pavlock.

Without the dedication, drive, creativity and devotion these people have
shown, Rogue Entertainment and it's products would not have been possible.

I would also like to say thanks to all who have purchased our products.
Without players, games would be nothing more than cool looking bookends.

Thanks to all and Happy (belated) B-Day Rogue!!!

Okay, it's time Jim's bi-annual .plan update. ;)

Alice is looking great.  I have to say that all of the new team members are
simply amazing.  Each and every one has added their own special touch to
Alice and to Wonderland and I (we) consider ourselves fortunate to have
found such talented people as these.

Speaking of which, I am also updating to see if there aren't more talented
people out there looking for a pirate hat and eye patch in their size.

While we have filled all of the open positions in the art and design
departments, we have a couple of open positions that we need to fill:
