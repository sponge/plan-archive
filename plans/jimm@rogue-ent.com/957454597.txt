All righty folks, it's time for all of you wannabe's out there to get
ready for a fun little Alice contest.

http://alice.stomped.com/dressup.html

Our #1 Fan Site is hosting a dress up contest.  Yep, that's right, all
of you Alice and Mad Hatter types out there will get to play for prizes.

All you have to do is dress up as either of the above and then send your
'winning' pic to: beachbum@stomped.com

The booty:

First Prize:  A Logitech Keyboard, Joystick and Mouse.
Second Prize: A Logitech Joystick.
Third Prize:  A Logitech Mouse.

AND...  All three winners will receive an autographed copy of Alice to boot!

So, what's more fun then donning a little pinafore action and winning
yourself some new gear and a copy of Alice?  All I can say is I'm wearing
my thigh-highs even now. :)

P.S.  Please do not sent your pics to me or to Rogue, we are not judging the
contest.  Thanks.
