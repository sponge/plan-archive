Well, as you probably all now know, Rogue has a new project.  Why we're
even going to buck tradition and tell you about it now. ;)

American McGee's Alice!

We are honored to be working with American and EA on Alice and we are
going work our asses off to make Alice all that it/she can be!

If you're looking for more information, go here:

alice.ea.com

If you need to contact someone here at Rogue, Barrett Alexander, our new CEO
(yes, yet another announcement), is your man.  We are all thrilled to have
Bear on board and if you'd like to welcome him to Rogue, or have a question
regarding Alice, mail him at:

bear@rogue-ent.com

On to yet more Rogue news... (Yes, it seems to be that day doesn't it.)

We have launched our new web site:

www.rogue-ent.com

Take a peek, let me know what you think.  I am especially excited by the
Studio page which will have a new article on it about once a month.
If there's something you'd like to know about, or see us write up for the
Studio, contact:

info@rogue-ent.com

Use the subject: Studio question or Studio comment.

Also, for those aspiring Roguers out there, this next tidbit of info is
extremely important.  Rogue is looking to help expand its team by filling
in the positions of:

Animator/modeler
2D texture/skins artist

If you need more info, go to the jobs page on the crew page on the new
site.

Well, I think that's it for now. (Whew!)  Boy, when it rains it pours, eh?

As always, you are more than welcome to talk to me about whatever:

jimm@rogue-ent.com

G'Day!
