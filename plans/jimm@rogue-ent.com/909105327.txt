We are getting a lot of support mail concerning missing entities or entities
that act unusual.  Almost all of these have been caused by a misplaced .dll 
file in the root of your Quake2 directory.  If you have a gamex86.dll in the 
root of your Quake2 directory and are having problems with the pack, delete 
that .dll.  It shouldn't be there and all it is going to do is mess with 
running either of the packs, or most of the Mods out there.

THE BLACHAWKS RULE!!!

Yes, they lost to the Stars last night, but one loss does not a Dallas fan 
make!  They'll be back on January 13th, and I'll be there.  Great fun was had 
by all and to Don "Enforcer" MacAskill: Probert ROCKS!!!
