{13 Feb 2000}

Things have been a bit quiet lately... been mapping away, had 
some communications with Alex that may or may not have anything 
to do with his update plugging Matrox. Not much to report on really 
(*Ehm*, nothing I'm allowed to report on anyway).

Actually...
Found out about this cool new site the other day: Harmonics (http://users.bigpond.com/harmonics/index.html) is devoted to the small(??) collection of Aussie Unreal mappers out there (you might recognise some of them). Worth a look, if not for all the great 
info and goodies, then at least for the weird retro contacts page :P
