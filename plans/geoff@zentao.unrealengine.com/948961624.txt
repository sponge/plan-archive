Project: Extreme Wing Chun VR for Unreal/UT

 <Jan 27 2000>

For those of you who havent seen my work, you might want to have a look in Nalicity (www.planetunreal.com/nalicity) for my Unreal singleplayer level pack: "The Tower of Shrakith'a". It got me this job, so it must be alright eh? 

-Note: you'll need the latest version of Unreal(v225f) to get it working. Enjoy :)

Now on to Zen Tao stuff....

I'm sure that working on EWC is going to be a challenge for me, but one that I'm really looking forward to. Mainly because of EWC's high polygon count - it's going to give me a chance to make some of the most detailed environments ever seen with the Unreal/UT engine. You only have to look at Tomasz "Millenium" Jachimczak's early screenshots to realise that, when completed, EWC is going to look pretty damn special. 

I've only been with the team for a matter of weeks now, but there's no mucking around and I'm really getting stuck into my work. Keep a eye on our site for any visual developments ;)
