As you can probably see, the new editor has many improved and helpful features. One such feature is enhanced Vertex editing. You can now select multiple vertices and drag them into place. This is a real time saver when making complex- multi faceted shapes or building eye snagging architecture.

So out of the blue...time to do a little update on Unreal 2. 

The Game

Over the past few months I have been working on all kinds of structures both exterior and interior. The sheer scale and complexity taking shape in U2 is exciting and I already have that burning urge to show our levels off to the public. Unfortunately that will have to wait for a bit longer.
	You know, the worst part about making a game is that you never get the full impact of seeing it for the first time after it is complete. Every few days I drop by another level designers desk and find myself floored by what they are doing. Needless to say, there is a plethora of talent working here. 
	More details? I'm working on a foreboding world that resides on the fringes of known space. Let that suffice for now.

The People

	It has been about five or six months since my first day here at Legend. During this time I have gotten to know just about everyone in the office and those who are working in other states or other countries. My exact place of work is in something we call THE CAVE_It is a dark and spacious area inhabited by 6 brilliantly demented cave dwellers who sole dietary staple is caffeine
_oh yes we also share this space with a mangled corpse who seems to enjoy sleeping all day.

The Time From Yesterday To Tomorrow.

	I like to take a drive every few days_ usually in the evening right before the sun sets. This is the time when most of my ideas start to develop. During these drives I listen to music and head out west towards the countryside of Virginia. I have been listening to the The Fragile lately to me it is a visually descriptive album and fits in well with the untouched landscapes of the countryside.
	Another means of gathering Ideas for my work I try to look at all kinds of things in the environment around me_our offices are in a somewhat industrial section of the state and as you could imagine there are all sorts of unique materials and shapes that come with industrial design. I have also been watching all of Ridley Scotts movies
_they tend to make great use of lighting and he imbues his work with a distinctive feel of ambiance. 
One other haunt of mine is the sprawl of Downtown Washington DC._I have always loved walking through cities_so much to see both alive and dead.
	As for Games I have been playing Thief 1 and 2 over and over again. The feel of the environments are great< the sound is great<The cut scene art is great< Yea I really dig this game. One level that I play over and over again is The Sword_something about the gardens and the bizarre mixing of forest, architecture, and dreamlike environments. Cool stuff.
	So for now_ I'll be up late at night working on Unreal 2_trying to imbue the game with all the thoughts from my days.
