As you may have noticed in the 1.06 patch, that I decided to
release "Brain Pain", or spool.bsp.  This was a map that I had
fooled around with back.. well let's see, the .map file for this
bit of wackyness is dated December 4th, 1998.  It was only a few
hours to make, but I figured why not have it see the light of day.
Be forewarned, spool is probably not very internet friendly.  I
imagine it would be quite insane with more then 5 people.

You can thank them for great entertainment over the years
such as Love at First Bite, Act One,The Survivors,
Zorro, the Gay Blade, Where the Boys Are,Evel Kneivel,
The Dead Don't Die, and Doc Hollywood.
I am talking ofcourse about George Hamilton who is 60 today.

I what I meant to say happy birthday to Ritual.

You may remember them from such films as "Scourge of Armagon",
"Sin", and the chart topper, "Gladys the Groovy Mule".
