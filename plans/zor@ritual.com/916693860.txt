Here is a story about.. let's call him "Tom".

	Tom was bored one evening and decided to purchase a set
of Laser Tag guns for his enjoyment.  Later that evening
he decides to play and gets a couple of friends to play
with him.  

	Fun was had by all, at least for a few hours or so.  Lots
of running, dodging, shooting and ducking.  But then a very strange
thing happened.. One of Tom's friends, let's call him "Zor" was being
chased down the stairs.  Tom had him on the run so he bounded down the 
stairs after Zor.  Tom, not being too bright.. doesnt know how to 
navigate stairs very well. The result - A nice tumble to the bottom.

Here is a picture of our hero..

Notice how he readys to cool his leg with a six pack of Dr. Pepper,
as we lack ice in the ritual cave.

Notice the swelling. :)

Moral of the story -- It's not nice to chase Zor.
