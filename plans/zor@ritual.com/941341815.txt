Ah, as Mark has already said, today marks the one year aniversary
of when the CD that originaly shipped left our small little island.
So from me, a loud 'Happy Birthday' goes out to Blade, Elexis, and
JC.  *sniff*  They've grown up so much and they are only 1!  I
can't wait to see the final version of the movie that they are
staring in.. if only JC would stop dressing up in drag.  :)

Sometime after this weekend, I'll announce a little contest to win
a copy of Heavy Metal when that baby is launched frrom the Ritual
womb.  Only a small amount of people will be able to compete
(probably around 14) so it will be first come first serve.  Let's
just say it will invlove competition against me, the one to best
me, gets the prize. :)
