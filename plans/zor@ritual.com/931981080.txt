I'm off today to Chicago for my twin brother <a href="mailto:brafish@stomped.com">BraFish</a>'s wedding this weekend.
You may remember <a href="mailto:brafish@stomped.com">BraFish</a> from such films as..
<a href="http://www.ritualistic.com/cgi-bin/download.pl?dir=sin/official/&filename=sin104.exe&dl=local">All Shall Fall</a> - A CTF map in Ritual's official CTF release
<a href="http://www.interplay.com/kingpin/index.html">Back Street Rumble</a> - A teamplay map in Xatrix's Kingpin
<a href="http://www.stomped.com/content/q2guide/index.html">Quake 2 Secret List</a>
Editing and content for the <a href="http://rogue.stomped.com/qe4/index.html">QE4 Quake Ed rev. 4.0 Manual</a>
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/quake/levels/ctf/ctf0.zip">The Twin Towers</a> - A quake CTF map
<a href="http://www.kvande.com/quake/hipnotic.txt">Scourge of Armagon Level Secrets</a>
<a href="http://stevep.ne.mediaone.net/doom/deathmatch/data/c/cage.zip">Cage</a> - A Doom level
Cage2 - The sequel to the popular doom level.. I can't find it though. Looks like it was overwritten
<a href="http://stevep.ne.mediaone.net/doom/deathmatch/data/c/cage3.zip">Cage3</a> - The second sequel to the Doom level

I don't have time to dig up other possible embarrasing things on Brandon,
because work is calling.  I'm sure I missed a bunch of stuff.
But feel free to <a href="mailto:brafish@stomped.com">email him</a> congratulations.

I did however find <a href="http://redwood.stomped.com/E3/morbidE3.html">this</a> for jack :)

*** Note this will hopefully be the last time I ever include html in my .plan file.
 think it's silly but I decided against my better judgement to include for your
convience :)  ***
