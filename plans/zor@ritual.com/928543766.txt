Well.. it's resolved.  

Here's how it went........

I removed every instance of glint, permedia, 3dfx, voodoo, and diamond (just the video parts anyways)
from the registry.
installed the creative drivers (same problem)
Installed the standard VGA driver (again)
Installed the reference drivers (didnt work at all)
Installed the standard VGA driver (again)
Installed the Creative Drivers.

And like magic they worked just fine.
I don't know what made it work this time but I don't care. :)

Thanks to the many people who wrote in.
