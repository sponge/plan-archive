I've gotten a few requests to expand my little contest.
So I've created a second division called "FAKK2".
Follow the instructions below to participate.  I'll
throw in another copy of our game to this winner as well.

Also I want to say thanks to Jeremy Easoz from Goldtree Games
(www.goldtree.com)for also adding a copy his game to the pot
for the 'Heavy Metal' division.

I also wish to thank my twin brother Brandon from High-Voltage
(www.high-voltage.com) for donating a title as well.

Alright.  Here's my little contest.

In honor of one of the greastest football players of all time,
Walter Payton, I am making a little fantasy football contest
to win a copy of Heavy Metal FAKK2.  I'm not sure how big of
a division can be made so it's first come, first serve.  I'm
guessing that only 20 can fit.

Here's the instructions..

First of all.. this is not an 'official' contest in any way
shape or form.  This is just a friendly competition where
I'll give the winner a free copy of our game when it's released.

ok.. for you lucky fellows who want to enter...

CNN has a several good fantasy football leagues that are free
so this will be easy.

step by step...

1. http://football.cnnsi.com/gm

2. Read the instructions if you feel so inclined.

3. Register with them (http://football.cnnsi.com/gm/registration/register.html)

4. After registering you will be asked to pick a division.. Choose
	"Join a user-created division"

5. The division name is "HeavyMetal"

6. There you go.  All signed up, now go ahead and play!

7.  Send me an email at zor@ritual.com with your team name

8. If you need anymore instruction, you may be dumb.


To the person who wins, I will send a free copy of Heavy Metal FAKK2.

If I win, I may be nice to the second place finisher but don't count on
it.  :)
