Welcome to my lil' cubby hole of internet space.  And for those of you that
aren't my personal friends that happened to stumble upon this, my 
appologies ;).

Well we got these little .plan files finally working, so I thought
I'd update mine with some totally irrelevant information (well, maybe just
a little bit of relevant stuff :).

But first, to my wonderful co-worker Paul (a.k.a. Talon).  If ever 
anything were to happen to Yanni, I swear you could take his place.  I 
mean I should really send a picture over to bluesnews so he can do a
seperated at birth between you two, it's scary.

Well the add-on pack has been under major development here since March of
this year, and now it's mostly down to adding all the fun game-play
elements to the levels.  Unfortunately, that's the most time-consuming
part of the process :(.  Our schedule's been hell from day one, so we've
been pretty much working our butts off to get this thing wrapped up.
There's a lot of goodies and new toys and elements that I really hope
people will dig and have fun with, cause in the end, that's what it's all
about :).

On a side note, for anybody out there who's a Rush fan, I highly recommend
the new live album: Different Stages.  It's an excellent live album, and
the other really cool thing is that 15 of the 22 songs were recorded 
from the show at The World Music theater in Chicago, and I was there at 
that show :)  These guys every time I've seen them always do it right, and
give nothing but their best, I think this live album really captured that.

But anyways, I think I've bored you enough with my drivel, so until 
next time.........
