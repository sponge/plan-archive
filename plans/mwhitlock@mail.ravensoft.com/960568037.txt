As a rabid Firebird & Camaro freak, I'm looking into finding a nice 3rd V8 Firebird or Camaro that's in great shape with a MANUAL transmission. Ideally something that's been stored during the winters (gotta love that salt), treated with care and has less than 75,000 on the clock. Do you know of anything fitting that description? 

Also interested in getting hold of '97 Firebird V6 (again manual tranny wanted) in similarly great condition. I currently have '98 Firebird V6 but the lack of tuner parts (i.e. no supercharger) is pushing me in the direction of selling and buying an older vehicle - so long as I can find one that's been cared for and is in great condition.

If you're looking to sell or know someone who's looking to sell something fitting the above description, let me know.
