Non work - all my own opinions:

Huzzah! After much scraping around for pennies and trading in my trusty v6 Firebird, I got my Camaro Z28 (actually a '98 vehicle - but it's in great shape apart from a bit of warpage on the front fender panel (which I'll probably be able to fix myself) and a bit of paint touch up needed on the door edges. Got it at a great price with just 22k on the clock. Going to be putting up a nice page or two at some point looking at the history of these awesome speed beasts (Camaro and Firebird). Bang for buck - you just can't beat the f-body. Now can anyone recommend a decent body shop in Madison (Wisconsin) where I can get my doors touched up like new? TIA!!
