Someone out there... please put me out of my misery... what's the origin of the freaky 'pyramid with the eye thing going on' that is printed on dollar bills? I'll be a happy Brit if anyone can tell me.

Yummy Soldier Of Fortune stuff

Yikes... a whopping two months since my last update... still working on stuff for Soldier Of Fortune. Just about finished porting the weapon and inventory system across into the player.dll so that all the player view-weapon animations and sequences (fire, reload, muzzle flashes etc.  Hmm... the whole dang shop actually!) are predicted and animate much, much nicer under laggy net conditions than the original Quake2 player view-weapons. Course, all this stuff will be customizable, being in a separate dll and all that. Muchos kudos to Gil for creating Ghoul! 

Also decided I'm going to stay with Raven... thought about travelling a bit more in the US (there's so much here that an islander like myself would like to see), but after considering everything... this had to be the coolest freakin' place in the world to work... [at least for normal people like us anyway, i.e. those of us who aren't porn stars, rock stars or movie stars with babes and cash coming out of the upholstery :)].
