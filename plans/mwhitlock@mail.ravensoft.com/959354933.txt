My condolences to the whole Looking Glass crew. Will anyone fill the void that exists now you guys won't be making any more Shock and Underworld games? I don't know - but the best of luck to you all wherever you wind up! The happy memories I have of playing LG's classics will stick in my mind until I'm old and senile. Underworld II - man, I'll never get over just how addictively immersive that one was... Now, at the time, I was in my intern year of my degree at Nottingham Trent University (back in England). Anyway - I was lodging in this crappy, shared house in this one horse town (that will remain nameless) and around then, there were a lot of break-ins and burglaries going down. So I asked my dad to take my PC back home (to my home town) where it wouldn't get nicked if anyone did come prowling. Unfortunately this meant that to get my weekly dose of Underworld II crack, every weekend I had to make a 4-hour train journey back to Kingston Upon Hull (and then back on Monday morning for work). Cancelled trains, nights spent sleeping on the benches at the station, IRA bomb threats (at that time, things were a bit dicey), overpriced train fairs (I was a poor student at the time)? Did it stop me? Did it hell!! Thanks for the great memories LG!!!
