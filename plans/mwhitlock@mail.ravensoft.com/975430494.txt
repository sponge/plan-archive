Been a long time since I wrote anything worth writing here..

Finally - we have a project for our new engine. Huzzah! As our engine is conceptually multi-platform, I am writing the PSX2 renderer portion of it, and liking it. Much to learn, but this is offset by PSX2's very elegant and flexible architecture. On the whole, a very pleasant departure from the crusty old PC architecture we all know and love!
