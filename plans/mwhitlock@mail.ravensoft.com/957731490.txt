Holy-***! Where did that come from? How can any other summer movie come close to topping Gladiator? No, let me re-word that... how can any other movie ever top Gladiator period!? Ridley Scott does it again... whilst Russel Crowe and the rest of the cast were just perfect (no stupid, out of place Hollywood foolishness here) and the cinematography was breathtaking. 10 out of 10 all around.

My top 5 movies of all time:

1)	Gladiator
2)	Blade Runner
3)	Return of the Jedi
4)	Star Trek II - The Wrath of Kahn
5)	Apocalypse Now
