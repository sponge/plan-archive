Thanks v. much to all the folk who emailed me with info on the origin of the 
freaky 'pyramid with the eye thing going on' that's printed on dollar bills. now 
I can sleep, er, I mean work easy.

Yummy Soldier Of Fortune stuff

Yikes... a whopping two months since my last update... still working on stuff 
for Soldier Of Fortune. Just about finished porting the weapon and inventory 
system across into the player.dll so that all the player view-weapon animations 
and sequences (fire, reload, muzzle flashes etc.  Hmm... the whole dang shop 
actually!) are predicted and animate much, much nicer under laggy net conditions 
than the original Quake2 player view-weapons. Course, all this stuff will be 
customizable, being in a separate dll and all that. Muchos kudos to Gil for 
creating Ghoul! 

Also decided I'm going to stay with Raven... thought about travelling a bit more 
in the US (there's so much here that an islander like myself would like to see), 
but after considering everything... this had to be the coolest freakin' place in 
the world to work... [at least for normal people like us anyway, i.e. those of 
us who aren't porn stars, rock stars or movie stars with babes and cash coming 
out of the upholstery :)].
