If you'd like to (and you know you would)... you can go vote for 'Soldier of Fortune' as your favorite upcoming 1st person action game at:

On the Soldier of Fortune front... I'm implementing the various deathmatch mods we're going to be including straight out of the box. Apart from standard deathmatch, there will be variants like assassin and arsenal (those of you who played TNP [Take No Prisoners] may recall these two). There will be other variants/mods but I won't go into them here just yet.

I see the UU3 (just a few days more 'til SS2 hits the shelves!!!) petition has garnered a few more names... why not go and add yours if atmospheric, immersive, 1st person perspective, 3D RPGs are your bag:

Oh and check this out... sometimes you just gotta wonder where some people were when mother nature handed out the brains:

I see SystemShock2 has gone gold and should be out soon... can't wait to play that one! LookingGlass have always made the BEST action RPGs (IMO) and SS2 should be just as lush and atmospheric as it's predecessor. Now if only they'd do Ultima Underworld III (Underworld II is only my favorite game ever!)... and strangely enough, there's a petition underway to persuade LG to make this very sequel. If you're a fan of the Underworld series, go add your name to the list... yeah it's a long shot, but wouldn't a third Underworld game (with today's technology driving it) rock the house?? Go add your 2 cents worth at:

Work wise, I'm still helping with Soldier of Fortune - working on deathmatch stuff mainly... this game is gonna play fast and deadly for sure.
