Has anyone upgraded from Win98 to Win2000 and forgot to uninstall McAfee Anti Virus?

If so you know what I'm talking about. !@#%$%$#%^#@!!!!

I tried deleting all mcafee and network associates references in the registry with no luck - installer gets right to the end and then rolls it all back.

This blows big time! Help!! Anyone!! Before I go and reinstall everything and waste a whole day.
