Rant - purely my own opinion:

All those folk bitching about Quake3's CD-key copy-protection scheme being a pain in the backside should just consider whether it's also too big a hardship to have to wipe their arse after going to the bathroom. Accept it, just like any other of the little inconveniences we all have to deal with in everyday day life. The fact is that because warezing is so rampant, idSoftware have been forced to go down the CD-key route. Where is the incentive for developers to create new titles if they don't think they can break even and recoup all the costs involved (development, marketing, distribution - it all adds up into millions of dollars). Look me in the eye and tell me that you really don't get it.
