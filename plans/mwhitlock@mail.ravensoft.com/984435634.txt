Ok for all you network professionals out there. My g/f is looking to change careers and become a network engineer / admin / professional. We are trying to figure out which direction she wants to take and thus, which courses she'll need to take. 

So is anyone out there willing to tell us a bit about what your day to job entails. I.e. a) what is your title, b) what qualifications one would need to get where you are today, c) what a typical work-day entails and d) how would someone break into this career at an entry level?
