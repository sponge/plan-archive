From ABCNEWS.com:

White House spokesman Ari Fleischer was adamant today when asked if the president believes such a change is necessary. 
"That's a big 'no,'" Fleischer said. "The president believes that it's an American way of life, that it should be the goal of policymakers to protect the American way of life. The American way of life is a blessed one." 
The president, he said, considers Americans' heavy use of energy a "reflection of the strength of our economy, of the way of life that the American people have come to enjoy." 
I almost choked on my soda when I read that. What the hell kind of example is the leadership of the most powerful nation in the world setting to the rest of the world? The message is loud and clear - "It's an American way of life to needlessly waste valuable resources and continue polluting - because we can and no one is going to tell us otherwise!" 

If the economy is so strong, then America should be using some of that money to lead the way in the search for new, clean sources of fuel technology... it's there waiting to be discovered (e.g. the hydrogen powered internal combustion engine)... if only the vested interests weren't suppressing it from becoming the norm. Instead we're stuck paying spiraling gas prices whilst continuing to foul the planet for future generations to come.
