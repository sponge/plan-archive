LOL! Looks like my little beef about the Bush administration and their energy policies (um, what policies) stirred up some feelings.

Funny how some people automatically assume that I'm suggesting we all go back to living in mud huts. The point is that technology and the environment can co-exist quite happily, but it means being responsible... not taking the quickest, easiest, most polluting way out because it's cheap to do so.
