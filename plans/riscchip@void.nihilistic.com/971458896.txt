Early next week Nihilistic Software will be moving from our old, overly "intimate" accomodations to a new bigger, badder, better building down the road. The new place is literally within walking distance of the old. I haven't been around long enough to feel nostalgic about the old place, and the new place is great, so I'm psyched.

The first thing we did was have it painted a dark shade of gray. The painters couldn't believe we wanted to do it. Then we had an even darker blue carpet installed. Those factors, combined with the complete absence of light that generally goes along with game development, and we're going to need our spelunking gear to go to work. Very cool.

I'm still pulling for a shark tank in the reception area...

Anyway, communications with us may be an issue early next week, so I figured this was worth mentioning.

Then again, everything may go smoothly...

Greetings. This is my first .plan file update at Nihilistic, and I'm 
afraid I don't have anything thrilling or significant to say. However, 
I've never had a .plan before (that I know of) and couldn't resist.

I just wanted to note that a lot of folks are still trying to email 
me at my Red Orb Entertainment email address, which is officially 
defunct. It may still work, but I have no access to it, so please use my 
new Nihilistic address or home email if you need to get a hold of me.

I've only been at Nihilistic a few days now, and I'm already loving 
it here. If you focused all of the talent here down into a single 
beam of energy, you could probably melt through a foot of solid steel. 
It's the best.

Anyway, thus concludes my first .plan. Next time I'll hopefully have 
something more interesting to say.
