Greetings. This is my first .plan file update at Nihilistic, and I'm 
afraid I don't have anything thrilling or significant to say. However, 
I've never had a .plan before (that I know of) and couldn't resist.

I just wanted to note that a lot of folks are still trying to email 
me at my Red Orb Entertainment email address, which is officially 
defunct. It may still work, but I have no access to it, so please use my 
new Nihilistic address or home email if you need to get a hold of me.

I've only been at Nihilistic a few days now, and I'm already loving 
it here. If you focused all of the talent here down into a single 
beam of energy, you could probably melt through a foot of solid steel. 
It's the best.

Anyway, thus concludes my first .plan. Next time I'll hopefully have 
something more interesting to say.
