Holy shit.

Well, the Zerstorer team has finally released what is, in my mind, the best
single player experience yet concieved for Quake. I played through it this 
morning, then had a co-worker of mine play through it. We raved and raved 
about it. It is totally immersive.. the new sfx are awesome.. everytime I 
saw one of the 'Fallen Angels' I ran in fear. 

Everything about the project is of top-notch, professional quality. I try to  
think of words to describe it, but all I can do is drool and mumble.. I am
totally in awe.

Zerstorer totally surpassed what I had thought possible, which should come
as no surprise when you are dealing with the people who brought it to life.

I am in awe.
I am amazed.
Congratulations.
