Tech Notes for those who've asked:
	Strife will run under the same operating systems as Doom2.

STRIFE is a role-playing oriented action game by Rogue Entertainment Inc.
It uses an improved version of Doom's excellent engine to bring
you an rpg style world.  the levels are seamlessly integrated to
represent a single world of connected maps. you can go back to the town
again and again to buy more ammo from the merchant.  or whatever.

[more story when we get time...]

tons more actors, robots, items, and yes, plot and missions.


tenative release date:
Fall '95 (This would be Fall in the USA)
