July 11, 1998

	The Second Annual Texas Electronica Festival was many things to
many people.  I tried to step into as many shoes as I could to see how
each person viewed it all.  I'm glad that I did.  I learned a lot about
myself, the people around me and of course about my love, Ivette.  Below
is a summary of a couple of the things that I saw/heard/felt.
	As many people found out... it was in the middle of no where!  And
of course, who can forget the intense Texas heat and dust.  
	The thing that I think impressed me the most is the fact that the
people that put the SATEF together did such a good job.  I was expecting a
weekend in the park with a couple of turntables under the trees.  But they
did an fine job of situating everything so that it was fairly convenient
considering how many people FLOODED through the gates.  Of course, once
the people started pouring through... and trust me... they poured through,
many of the 'plans' were shot out of the window and you simply had to hope
that people were sober and smart enough not to do anything TOO stupid.
Everyone had ONE thing on their mind... PARTY!  Trying to convince people
to do the 'smart' thing wasn't that easy to do.  There were no police or
security on the premises, which meant that everyone was, more or less, on
an honor system.  Fortunately, I found out that many of the kids
understand and abide by the word 'respect'.  Something that you don't see
much anymore.  Sure there were a few loudmouths amongst the crowd (as I'm
sure I was after drinking FAR too much before the sun even set *sigh*),
but all in all it was a good crowd.  I felt safer and more comfortable at
the SATEF that at any concert I've been too (which by the way includes
Yanni and Reba McIntire - Don't ask! *GriN*)
	The music was loud and the sound was good under both tents.  There
were a few problems with a lack of electricity to power all of the vendors
and DJ's but everything worked out in the end.  A number of people played
my congas with me while we tried our best to keep up with the 100+/bpm of
the music.  In every section of the park people were doing lots of
different things.  Some were blowing bubbles, playing frisbee, hacky sack,
twirling around huge banner-kites, swimming in the pool, kicking around
big rubber balls, having water gun fights, painting, playing with dogs,
making crafts, and of course... Dancing!
	As for the DJs... I heard some really awesome music.  Of course I
also realized that when you play music at 100+/bpm it all sort of sounds
the same when you are further away from the speakers and listening to it
for 18 hours straight.  It seemed like a number of the DJs all used the
exact same drum machine.  *shrug*  All in all, I'd have to say that the
DJs deserve a huge THANKS for a job well done.
	I had a good time dancing and bouncing around with my glowsticks.
Something that caught my eye was the break-dancing circle.  Personally I
feel like break-dancing was fun when I was in junior high and listening to
Grandmaster Flash but I feel like the kids now adays should break away
from all of the nostalgia and come up with their own original style of
dance that they can call their own.  But that aside, I was impressed at
the show that the breakers put on.  Especially considering that they did
it on a dirt floor with no mats or pads.  I remember thinking that all of
them were probably going to be collecting disability some day for neck and
back problems.  But I did the same stuff when I was younger, so I figured
they were probably just as stubborn and 'invinsible' as I was.  ;-P
	There were also a lot of people packed inside of their cars with
the A/C on trying to cool off.  It was hot!  Even at night.  I carried
around a gallon jug of water with me most of the time so that I wouldn't
dehydrate.  It's also a good thing that the moon was out and almost full.
Otherwise, some of the people might still be wandering around in the
woods.  :)
	I tried to get a couple of hours of rest but that wasn't going to
happen.  Fireworks were going off throughout the night.  People kept
driving in and out of the main site which had me worried, because I didn't
have any way of knowing whether or not they were sober and of course there
was no way for me to enforce that they HAD to stop driving because they
might hit someone or run over a tent full of people.  Then of course there
were the people on the little 'buggy' that were zooming around with no
place to go and hooping and hollaring the entire time.  There was
definitely a noticeable lack of authority.  But on the flip side, I don't
think that any police/security force would have wanted to patrol that
night.  I believe that locking everyone inside at dark was by far the best
decision that the organizers made.
	After realizing that I couldn't sleep I decided to walk around
some more and that's when I walked into the 'citronella farm'.  There was
an area with about two dozen citronella candles lit.  I immediately
realized that I MUST be allergic to the stuff.  I was gassed numerous
times, in the Army, with tear gas, and none of them hurt me as bad as
those candles.  I was in a lot of pain and couldn't breath.  I realized
that my weekend was going to have to come to a quick end.  So, when the
sun rose, Sunday morning, Ivette and I headed out.
	When we left, we could see the potential for utter chaos.
Hundreds of cars parked anywhere there was space and tents littered
between all of them.  It became evident that when all of these people
began to leave... all it was going to take is for one person to screw up
and the one lane road would be blocked.  Leading to more chaos.  Since, we
didn't stay, all I can say, is that I hope that everything went well.  If
anything bad happened, I'm sure that I'll hear about it.  I just hope that
I don't.
	All in all, I'd have to say that the SATEF was one of the most
interesting times that I've ever had.  I'm sure that the organizers put a
lot of blood, sweat, and tears into it, and I hope that they get thanked
accordingly.
	As for all of the people that I met out there... PLUR.  I'll be
thinking about ya!
	And as a final note.  Next year, I'm bringing three big socks and
giving one to Mook, one to Jynx and one to Curly.  Since they seem to
always be near me when I get drunk and my lips get loose, maybe they can
shove one of the socks in my mouth, before I stick my foot in and have to
regret it later.  ;-P

	For the 4th of July, Ivette convinced me to throw a party.  So, I
invited some friends and told them to bring their computers and we had a
little network gaming party in my computer room, and everyone else watched
all of the South Park episodes from the first season while they munched on
tacos and other goodies.
	Although there were more than a dozen people here and enough
alcohol for 50 people, no one drank enough to get naked and the party
never got rowdy enough for anyone to call the police.  I was a bit
worried.  It appears that most of the friends that I've made since I moved
to Austin are very low-key and are quite happy sitting around and watching
movies and stuff.  I find it pretty strange, yet subtly pleasant.  (Sort
of like listening to Enya)
	I've been spending a lot of time reworking all of the older models
that are on my website.  I'm trying to cut the number of faces in each
model by half, without any noticeable change in their shapes.  I'm doing a
pretty good job so far.  I hope to be able to render some large scale
battles now that computers are fast enough to do it in a reasonable amount
of time.  So far, the only setback is that the Zip disk that had all of my
materials on it went bad.  So, I'm going to half to recreate all of the
textures from scratch.  (Of the 12 Iomega Zip disks that I have, 5 have
gone bad.  I can't wait for Castlewood to release their 2 Gig Orb Drive)
	As for Golgotha, it looks awesome.  With the new skies and moving
clouds and other assorted goodies, I think that it will definitely get
some people's attention... assuming of course that we get a publisher.
We've all been working very hard on Golgotha and it has changed it's shape
and design numerous times in the development process.  But I feel that
each change has made it a better game.  My favorite bragging point right
now is that Golgotha only has 2 artists, 2 programmers and 1 musician,
whereas similar games have had teams consisting of dozens of people
working on them.
	In other news, I'm really looking forward to going to the Second
Annual Texas Electronica Festival this weekend.  I just got my free
tickets in the mail (Ivette and I are volunteer workers).  There are over
60 DJs scheduled to perform.  This should prove to be a pretty kewl event.
	My AD&D campaign is going well.  Looks like I'm going to have a
couple of new players for the next session.  I've decided that I'm going
to allow up to 8 people to play.  Assuming that I can find 8 people that I
trust in my house.  I've been contacted by some VERY strange people.  The
wierdest one so far is a black guy that claims to be a top secret
operative for the Navy who gets called out of the country on occasion to
give the Navy his advice on dealing with foreign threats, yet he doesn't
have a car and has to take the city bus everywhere and he has to walk to
his sister's apartment to use her phone because his was disconnected while
he was out of the country last week.  Needless to say, he won't be coming
to my apartment.  ;)

June 8, 1998

        The Austin Burning Man was a blast!
        It was LITERALLY in the middle of Nowhere.  We were expecting it
to be bigger than it was and we weren't sure if we were going to want to
spend the night, so we didn't really bring enough supplies (ie. tent,
sleeping bags, and food)
        We actually shook hands with and introduced ourselves to
practically everyone there.  The people were awesome.  They shared their
food, drink, and even loaned us extra blankets.  Of course, there was NO
lack of alcohol and everyone was making special drinks and sharing with
the rest of us.
        Because of the burning ban, we didn't think that we would be able
to have a 'burning man', but 'fortunately' there were a few Pagans on hand
that had a ceremony to ask for rain and then another to protect us from
the elements.  I'm not a Pagan and I can't vouche for the presence of
their abilities, but it DID rain enough for us to burn the man and the
rest of Saturday and Sunday's weather was INCREDIBLE.
        After building the MAN on Saturday afternoon we did some skinny
dipping in the creek and the pool, drank a LOT, ran naked through the
woods, and continued to meet people.  When we finally lit the MAN I was
pretty drunk and most of the ceremony is a blur.  I know that I danced
around the fire circle wearing nothing but my sandles and a little leather
pouch with my car keys in it.  We formed a drum circle and I played my new
congas for a while.  Some of us decided to shed our clothes and toss them
into the bonfire while dancing around.  I have a nice sunburn thanks to
the fact that I threw my only shirt in.  The rest of the night was filled
with music, drinking, and talking about everything from God to plans about
going to the national Burning Man in August.
        We were actually surprised that there were almost as many women as
men.  Most of the people were blue collar workers with net access and a
few of us were in the computer industry.  The crowd was very eclectic and
it would be almost impossible to say that there was a majority of one
stereotypical social group.  It was very carefree and comfortable.
        Two of the guys camping next to us were the ones that built the
big Statue of Eeyore for Eeyore's Birthday, so they had the statue set up
for all to admire.  We played volleyball and I named our teams, the Us'es
and the Them's.  Eventually the volleyball ended up in the pool with an
attempt at playing nude water volleyball in 4 feet of water.  This
Definately should be a spectator event.  ;P
        I wish that we would have brought more film for the camera because
there were definately some memorable moments.  I'm already looking forward
to next year's Austin Burning Man, but I plan to be MUCH more prepared.  I
also hope to round up a bunch of friends to go with us next time.
        Ivette and I met some good people this weekend and after
exchanging business cards and phone numbers, hopefully some good
friendships will come out of the event.

        Well, I finally went out and got a car.  It's just a Nissan Altima 
GXE 4-door, but it's going to cost me a bit more than I planned on
spending because of the 21% interest rate.  *ACK!*   
        ( I HIGHLY recommend that you make some sort of effort to pay back 
your student loans and don't wait 5 years for them to default and have the
banks destroy your credit. *sigh*)
