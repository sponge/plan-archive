The HexenII patch is almost done.  We have been trying very hard to address
all of the bugs that we have become aware of.  Special thanks to Rick "Super fly"
Johnson for his super human effort on the patch! Thanks to everyone that has
emailed me their bugs and to the HexenII RING for all the great messages and feed
back from them.  Looking VERY forward to the next batch of games we are going
to be working on!(cant say until contracts are all signed!) But these will be
awesome to design and work on.  Once we are allowed to announce them feel free
to send us any ideas or suggestions you may have.
    Raven had its annual Paintball party last sat. and it was a blast!  It was
the HexenII team/management VS TNP/Mageslayer....well needless to say we
(HexenII) shot the H___ out of our co-workers! It was not pretty, and we had to
sacrifice bob love (who still cant walk yet!) but they fell for the bait! Who
wouldn't want to shoot bob with paintballs. Once again, SuperFly Johnson was
like a surgeon out on the field, selectively cutting out the opposition.

Well,  Off to finish the patch.

Hexen II is GOLD! it could be out in stores as early as Sept 13th-15th
from what I am told. Call your local store to find out for sure.

Just wanted to say that we addressed the 16meg problems and things should run
just fine now, we also optimized internet play so that is faster as well.
 I change the first level of the demo so if you buy the game
things will be a bit different.  On some hubs in the game the puzzels can be
quite challenging so be ready to think.

I hope everyone likes it!

THE DEMO "IS" OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We worked straight through the week and at 20 hours a day to get this out
as soon as we could. We are very proud of it and certainly hope you like it.
Again we are very sorry that we missed out projected date and needless to say
we have learned a lesson! =)

Thanks to those many many people that sent me supportive emails in regard to
holding off on the demo. THANK YOU!


Please send any bugs we missed to our bug list.

Today we offically become one with Activision!!!!

We are all very excited about this here at Raven ! =)

HexenII demo/game- Today I closed out all of the bugs that I have (with verification
from Activision/id of course).

Still some issues out there but we are making great progress.

Please don't ask me when the demo will be out.  I don't want to upset people
with a date I feel good about only to have something else crop up.

Well, back to play testing, hmm, should I be the necromancer this time or
the assassin?
