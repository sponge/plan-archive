June 10th,

Today I am working on finishing up the levels for E3.

We Will be including the outdoor area with the sheep! and with some

of the new things we just got in.  I am also sending an egyptian level.

The stat bar will be in as well as all of the Paladin weapons with power ups.

We will also include many artifacts.

Finished the first level....what a pain!  I think I made it too big!
(if that is possible).  I will populate it and put in the puzzles and
see how she flys.  The Egyptian level will be a piece of cake compared to
all of the rolling hills and caverns.

looks like long night ahead of me.

<<< I missed Warcraft Wed. so that I could finish this demo....I would
love to have the 4 Raven Grand Master WarcraftII players (Me, Bob Love,
Gil Gribb, and Rick Johnson) take on the top 4 at Blizzard!...Just let me
know!!!  >>>>>  email me at braffel@mail.ravensoft.com

We finished the demo for E3 and I feel very good about it.  It is totally
playable with all weapons for the Paladin in and working great.  It also has
the puzzle pieces in and working correctly. I love the translucent water effect
we have in! now we can have cool water in both the standard and GL versions!
Today I am on to the alpha build which should be within a week or two.  Maybe
now I can go see lost world, I can't believe I have not had time to see
this yet!

Ironed out the final details for the puzzles for the first/second hub.
I am very happy with the flow and logic of the puzzles.  Now I just need
to implement them!! =).I am looking forward to hear from Eric B. how E3 is
shaping up and what new titles are coming out.  I think I hear(I could be wrong) that there are something
like 1200 titles being shown at E3.  WoW if that is true that is alot of games
to compete with!

**quick note- Rick and I will have our revenge on Gil& O'l christy love**



June 26th

Finished all of my levels arch. today!!!!! finished redoing the cathedral.
It looks ALOT cooler than before, and faster.  I am now implementing all
of the puzzles for the first hub (6 big levels!) .  It should take most people
about 8-16hours to finish this hub. (that is a guess dont hold me to it!!)
I just want to say that I am sorry that I have not been visiting the web
pages and giving response(oatmeal,phobeus)but until alpha I will not be able
to.  I will do my best before beta.

Note: Never let your daughter have a slumber party.





July 10th,

Wow, guess it has been a long time since I last updated. I have been
cranking on the first and third hubs.  I now have all of the puzzles working
!!!!. no small feat.  In a couple of places I have it that depending on which
way you go, the puzzles will be different(3 different ways).  I like the puzzles
we have.  They are going to take some thought, but will be logical. The only thing
I would change in Hexen was the 7 portals.  ALOT of stupid running  around hitting
switchs that all looked alike.  This is the first game that I have worked on since
BLACK CRYPT (my first game) that I feel has the kind of puzzles I like to find in
games. I love rpgs and haven't come across too many I have liked over the last few years.
I should say that I haven't tried daggerfall, and others tell me it is good.  I loved
Eye of the beholder,Dungeon master, Lands of Lore (just when is LL2 coming out?
3/4 yrs in the making) and My all time favorites BARDS TALE I+II. We are still
planning on putting BLACK CRYPT out on win95 but HexenII is taking top prioity.
If you would like to see Black Crypt out on windows please let me/us know.

Finally, we played Warcraft against a couple of guys at Origin last night.
We beat them (this time) but they were quite good.  Good game skippy Lord pall.

**********************************
Hi,

Well I would like to thank Zentron and Oatmeal for being such good friends
of Raven...Thanks for all you guys have done for us!!!

I would like to dedicate my first level of the game to them.  (That would be
Black Marsh, the first level of the game)  I have two sheep on that level.  I
will call one zentron and the other....you guessed it Oatmeal.  So be nice
to those sheep when you play the game.

Things are looking good!! deathmatch is alot of fun.


brian

PS- To those poor guys in Canada who have foolishly challenged us (rick,bob,
gil and me) to a game of warcraft....think hard before showing up to fight us.
We may not be from blizzard but we do play a mean game of warcraft.



July 21st
*************************************************

Almost got ALL of my levels done.  Very Close.  I just want to make a
few points to all of those webmasters out there kind enough to make
HexenII pages.

1). THANKS!
2). I gave special dedication to the webmasters, Zenton and Oatmeal for helping
us out in a situation not pertaining to the webpages.  We at Raven are very
impressed with alot of the different sites out there and hope to help everyone
doing a site as best we can.

3). I don't try to show favoritism to anyone group,but when people help us out
I want to say thanks.  

Thats it.  Well, back to it! trying to put the finishing touches on a puzzle in
the egyptian hub....I hope it is not too hard!



July 31st
****************************************************
Well, been quite a while since I last entered anything.

I have ALL of my levels done (13) and they are ALL working!!!!! =)

Deathmatch and coop are working well and we are just implementing the last
details of the game.  I can not wait until the game is out. Just for the
record, the build that got out on the net was a pre-alpha from about month
and half ago.  I HATE PIRATES! >:(

Anyway, now is were I have to point out that we crushed some people from england
in warcraft last night. We called the map America after the match...we thought
it fit.  What we need is a true challenge.

Insights to bob love:

Bob loves puppys, and half/half on his captain crunch in the morning.  His
favorite color is yellow...like the sun.  He writes poetry about programming
in basic.(the only programming language he is qualified in!).

Bob quote of the day: "Hey, I know how to use my stick!" - playing pool of course.


Ode to RICK Johnson:

Rick, A man of the times,
RIck, one with his code,
Rick, makes hexen monsters shine,
Rick, and that is why I wrote this ode!

Rick is my FAVORITE warcraft team mate.  I don't have to bail him out like
bob.  Thanks rick!


Aug 4th 1997
*********************************************************
Well, just running through my levels fixing small bits here and there, aliening textures and addressing balance issues. Eidolon is working and he is bad to the bone!  Ok  people out there that said
That korax was a wimp...lets see ya take on Eidolon.... I pity the fool! (tm mr T).
I can only  imagine that if I were to fight him in real life it would be how bob love must feel when he plays me in Warcraft.  I think Rick would agree!

Well  lunch is over so back to egypt3.map  but before I go I have to write my 


Ode to EricB.

Ericb, His levels are flowing and fair,
Ericb, His foosball so powerful, with him do not tangle!
Ericb, Many opponents and egos he does tear.
Ericb, Do not cross or your manhood will from his belt jangle! 

I know ...don't quit your day job!



Aug 21st
**********************************************************

We are done with the DEMO!!!!!    =)  =)  =)


I had the best time watching Bob "BECCA" Love getting killed over and over as
he tried to deathmatch.  He would turn invisible and try and be tricky with the
polymorph artifact...but Eric just killed him as invincible,invisible, sheep!

Poor bob, unlucky at warcraft and unlucky at HexenII.

 The demo will be out sometime tommorrow.
Please don't look on our site for the demo (we switching over to our t1 from
a basic service)  Go to Activision or Id for the demo.


Have fun and join in on our IRC chat tomorrow night at 7:00 pm  (I am missing
a Packer game to be there, so show up!!!!)  Let us know how you like the demo.


Enjoy!!!



Aug 22nd.
**********************************************************************

                                >>>DEMO UPDATE<<<

We have decided to hold the demo until we address a couple of small bugs that

just cropped up.  Very Sorry that we didn't quite hit

the date we were hoping, we have all been working around the clock and we are

as dissapointed as you but we don't want to put this out with bugs that may

disrupt your enjoyment of the game.  I take full responsiblity - feel free

to vent at me at braffel@mail.ravensoft.com.


Again Very sorry, but it will be out in the very near future.

brian



Aug 22nd - AGAIN
*******************************************************************

Hi Everyone.

Just want to thank everyone who emailed me. (around 300!!!)

I was impressed by how many supportive emails I got.  I was expecting that

about 70% would be from people that were upset with us but it was about 93%

that said "good move" and THANKS!!.  I understand why people would be upset, I get upset

when I am looking forward to something and it doesnt happen. (like beating bob

in warcraft!).  I think it is in everyones best interest to have the game as bug

free as possible (notice I did not say 100% bug free-that never happens).

We have been working very hard and Activision and Id have been there with us

giving us feedback and support.  Now here are the top 10 Reasons the Demo was

late!! =)

        >>> Top Ten Reasons The Hexen II Demo was Late<<<<<

        10.  The Oatmeal sheep got loose from Demo1(first level) and was
                running around the office!!!!

         9.  Rick spilled yet another Mr. Freeze on his shirt and it
             spilled out all over the code.

         8.  Mike Gummelt thought I said "lets ESP that level" instead
             of BSP.

         7.  Bob Love has fallen in love with the assassin and we can't
             find were he has hidden her!! (we have our suspicions!)

         6.  That sleep thing kept getting in the way!

         5.  That UPS strike...ya, thats it, that whole thing really threw
             us off!

         4.  I ran out of Pepsi.

         3.  Kenn wrote so much on his finger that there was no more
             room on the server for the new Hexen demo code.

         2.  The Cat in the Hat....nuff said.

         1.  That darn Snail got out again!

    ***The Demo cometh soonth***

    brian

    PS- You can stop emailing me now if you want  =)



         1.  That Damn snail got out again!!
