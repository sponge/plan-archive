For the users who have reported problems with the audio in the Soldier of Fortune demo
(game crashing with certain sound cards, "muffled sound", weird audio attenuation issues,
etc...), please follow these two guidelines for a quick fix:

1) Make sure you have the *latest* drivers for your soundcard.

2) If problem persists, go into the audio configuration menu and change the sound setting from
"Auto Detect", "EAX", or "A3D" to "Default".  Please make sure to press "Apply Changes" after
making the re-adjustment.

Thanks for your time.  I appreciate all your feedback concerning the demo.
