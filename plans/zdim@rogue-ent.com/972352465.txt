Greg's site is up again.  And there was great rejoicing.

Don't Be A Vidiot
by Greg Costikyan
http://www.crossover.com/~costik/vidiot.html

If you're a game designer, you gotta read this!

Newstuff:

In my last post, I listed game designer Greg Costikyan as a game industry analist.
I meant, of course, "analyst."

An analist must be something entirely different, I'm quite sure.  ; )

Thanks to Wm. Haskins for ever being my favorite editor, and appologies to Costik for the oops.

Also, I meant to put up a link to Greg's awesome MUST READ article, Don't Be A "Vidiot", but in my haste, I forgot!  Now I find that his site, or its server, is temporarily down.

Oh well.  We try.  Here's the link to Greg's site where you can find this great article along with all of his other goodstuff.  Let's hope it gets back online soon!
