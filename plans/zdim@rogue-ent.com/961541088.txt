"...when the sockmonkey comes riding in on his red tricycle,
bringing joy and happiness to all the nightmare creatures"
-Steve Rescoe http://www.stomped.com/interviews/psychocircus4.html

The SockMonkey lives again!!!

The original Sockmonkey by Steve Rescoe
http://ftp.sunet.se/idgames/graphics/monkey.zip

"Amusing sockmonkey pedals all around on it's little red
tricycle,then tries to rip your face off...until you blast
the stuffing out of it...This is a replacement for the pink
demon in Doom and DoomII."
