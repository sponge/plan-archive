It's one of those typical hot Texas summer days today. The kind of
hot that makes your skin sag, eyes bulge, mouth grimace, tongue loll,
shoulders droop and arms dangle, as you lurch across the street or
parking lot, panting, sweating, and looking like some Basil Wolverton
character come to life.

It's Friday. Do you know where your bsp is?

I highly suggest listening to Weather Report while map
making.  Particularly the 'Jaco Pastorius period'. It's
like Escher for the ears.

The ugliest woman in history?

http://members.xoom.com/_XMCM/LennyDeRooy/alicepic/other/duchess.jpg

The portrait of 'A Grotesque Old Woman' (1513),
painted by the Flemish Renaissance painter Quintin
Massys, served as a model for TennielM-^Rs Duchess. The
'Ugly Duchess' on the paiting is supposed to be
Margaretha Maultasch, a fourteenth-century duchess
of Tyrol and princess of Carinthia. "Maultasch"
(meaning 'pocket-mouth') was a name given to her
because of the shape of her mouth. She had the
reputation of being the ugliest woman in history. We
don't know how much the Massys' painting resembles
the real duchess, because it was painted 200 years
after her death. (source: Gardner, M., The Annotated
Alice, 1998, p.82 and Stoffell, S. Lovett, Lewis
Carroll in Wonderland. The life and times of Alice
and her creator, 1997, p.76)

Hey Bobby, what's up?  How's the new bionic implant?  Watch out for those nanites; they can really make you groggy when they're in full effect.

Take care, ol' bean!

"Amusing sockmonkey pedals all around on it's little red
tricycle,then tries to rip your face off...until you blast

demon in Doom and DoomII."
