L. Sprague de Camp Passes On
http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/books/de_camp_obit_001107.html

De Camp, who lived in Plano, wrote one of my favorite books of all time, The Fallible Fiend. I got my nick from the main character in that hilarious novel.

While acknowledged by his peers as a master fantasist, he also wrote hard sci fi and historical novels.  His best known books are probably Lest Darkness Falls, the Krishna series, and the Compleat Enchanter novels.  He also wrote a mean short story, and collaborated with Robert Howard on his Conan books, later taking over and continuing the series after Howard died.
