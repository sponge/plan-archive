Exhibition
by Ian Finley
"An artist's life story is told through his final exhibition,
and through the viewpoints of four onlookers. IMHO, Exhibition
is the first true masterpiece of puzzleless IF (no, I'm not
forgetting Photopia--but it's not entirely puzzleless). It is
enhanced by professionally-rendered graphics and sound." -Tril*
