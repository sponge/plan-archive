ADDENDUM:

I've gotten a flood of e-mails since posting this saying that I'm a terrible bald-faced liar and the demoscene is alive and well thank you very much. Here's a list of relevant links:

Sorry I don't have time to write something a little more eloquent, but we're pretty busy here right now. At the very least, my apologies to the demoscene fans for slighting them. :-)

ORIGINAL POST:

I've been a fan of demoscene music ever since the Amiga days. I often downloaded new demos more in anticipation of the music than of the graphic effects and other technical wizardry. I was always amazed at the quality of music that demos could play while FM synthesis was still a new thing in PC games. The demoscene has petered out in recent years, possibly due to the rise of 3D video hardware. MadOnion.com is still making demos and calling them benchmarks, but aside from that and a few other examples, there just aren't many being produced anymore. Perhaps the demos will return when the GeForce 3, with its programable graphics hardware, is released.

But I digress. The point wanted to bring up was that the demoscene musicians are still around. Some have jobs at video game companies. Others are pursuing careers as professional recording artists. The artist in particular that I wanted to bring to your attention is one Andrew "necros" Sega, who formed the group "The Alpha Conspiracy." You can check out their web page at http://www.alphaconspiracy.com

The Alpha Conspiracy recently released their first album, "Cipher", under their own independent record label. It is a collection of new material as well as some remixes of some of their previously released music. I listened to Cipher for the first time today and I enjoyed it immensely. Since I want to hear more music from this group in the future, I figured I'd best spread the word about them.

The Alpha Conspiracy describes themselves as "a project intended to explore the expanded rhythmic, tonal, and structural palette which modern electronica provides. The result could be broadly categorized as off-kilter electro-indie-emo-pop." If that sounds interesting to you, you can download several sample songs from Mp3.com. If you like what you hear, then go ahead and order the album. I certainly don't regret the purchase.
