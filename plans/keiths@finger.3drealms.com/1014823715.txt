<p>The weird thing about scary movies is that every time a movie scares you in some way, it raises the bar. What scared you in one movie likely won't scare you next time you see it in another movie. In the past few years, I've felt my horror movie resistance level rising with each great horror movie 

I've seen. Up until I started watching movies regularly with Stephen Cole, something like <i>Raising Cain</i> or <i>The Watcher In The Woods</i> was my idea of a really scary horror flick. Thanks to Stephen, in recent years I've been introduced to gems like <i>Suspiria</i> and <i>The Legend of Hell House</i>. When we went to see <i>Blair Witch Project</i> at the Inwood, I figured I'd seen it all. How could any movie be scarier than that one?

<p>Well, same as with most anything... count on the Japanese to take something we did, and do it better. Lots better. Everybody knows that's true of cars, but it tends to be true of video games and movies, too. I've observed this phenomenon for a while now, and it seems like producers of American media get too caught up in making it look "real" or "right." The Japanese just make it look cool. For every <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, they've got a <i>Princess Mononoke</i>. For every <i>Medal of Honor</i>, there is a <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>.

<p>I've now seen <i>The Ring</i>, which if nothing else, teaches us that the language of horror is universal. It says a lot, I think, that it is easily the scariest movie I've ever seen, and I couldn't understand a lick of dialogue throughout the entire thing. <a href="http://pokerindustries.com/acatalog/ringKOdvd.htm"><i>The Ring</i></a> is about a reporter who is investigating the murder of several teenagers, who each died in the same, inexplicable way. In her investigation, she learns that they had each died exactly one week after watching a certain videotape. She watches the tape herself, and realizes with horror that it is cursed, and that now she, too, has only one week left to live. The movie follows her desperate attempt to solve the mystery of the contents of the video during the course of that week.

<p>Last night, we watched a Korean remake of <i>The Ring</i>, called <a href="http://pokerindustries.com/acatalog/ringvirusdvd.htm"><i>The Ring Virus</i></a>. It wasn't quite as scary, though the production value was a little better. More importantly, this DVD contained English subtitles. Since <i>The Ring Virus</i> is nearly a scene for scene duplicate of <i>The Ring</i>, we were finally able to understand what was being said. Best of all, it helped make sense of the ending, which turned out to be really, really cool.

<p>I highly recommend <i>The Ring</i> to any fan of horror movies. If you decide to buy it, though, try to avoid watching any of the trailers or even the DVD menu. For some reason, they decided to throw some nasty spoilers in.

<p>You might have noticed that the links above point to an online store called <a href="http://www.pokerindustries.com/">Poker Industries</a>. I highly recommend that you give this fine merchant your patronage. We have purchased many, many examples of <a href="http://pokerindustries.com/acatalog/parasiteevedvd.htm">fine</a> Asian cinema from them, as well as some pretty <a href="http://pokerindustries.com/acatalog/wetropedvd.htm">depraved</a> examples, too. (Yes, Virginia, there is such a thing as nunsploitation. You furries out there might want to check this title out, too.)

<p>You probably had better start snapping up some of the choicer <a href="http://pokerindustries.com/acatalog/moonovertaodvd.htm">titles</a> quick, too. Your friends and mine, The Reich of <a href="http://www.disney.com/">The Mouse</a>, have turned their venomous gaze eastward, and they have learned what fans of Asian cinema have known for a long time: there are some really good <a href="http://www.iron-monkey.com/">movies</a> out there, and there is probably money to be made bringing them to the largely ignorant United States.

<p>This isn't re
