Plan:
Well, I made it back to Jacksonville, FL safely after attending my first
Beatdown.  That's a <strong>long</strong> flight ... FL to CA and back
again.  Fortunately, for me, I'm able to sleep on planes :)  I ended up
having a really good time!  Thanks to Bastard for providing me with a P2-300
w/Voodoo2 (this was the first time I've had a chance to play on a Voodoo2
machine) to play on.  I met some really interesting people at the Beatdown
(hi HickBoy).  I had the most fun playing Rocket Arena 2 while I was there.
Everyone seemed rather underwhelmed at the Denny's turnout ... only around
two dozen this time.

What?!  You want a GameSpy update too?!  Tim did some tweaking on the SSL on
the flight out and back ... the SSL is <strong>much</strong> faster now.
You will be very impressed.  We just gave a final RC to the QA team today
and don't really expect them to find anything.  I anticipate GameSpy 2.02
being released this week.
