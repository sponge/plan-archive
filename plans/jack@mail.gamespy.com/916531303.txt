Well, I was diving into some DDraw coding to work on some stuff, when I
realized how much the DDraw returns sucked.  They return these *really ugly*
nebulous negative numbers, that I didn't feel like dealing with.  Now my
friend Rod at 3Dfx told me a trick of anding them by 0xFFFF and grepping
them in ddraw.h, but I thought eh, screw that, so I wrote a little proggy to
deal with it for me.  It's a useful little gem (that Microsoft
*******REALLY******* ought to have in the DX SDK) that I coded up really
quick.  Anyone doing DirectX development should find it semi useful.  It's
called dxerror, and you give it a DDraw error number, and it looks in
DDraw.h for you and gives you the error constant and the comments preceding
it.  It's free, have a party:

Oh, and has anyone got the Tribes networking spec laying around?  I'd like
to put it into GameSpy already :).  Actually, I was at a LAN party and saw
someone had a cool port snooper, anyone got one lying around?  Thanks.
