<b>DISCLAIMER: MY WORDS DON'T REPRESENT 3DFX INTERACTIVE INC, DAMMIT.

What people will do for a couple of frames...  I really recommend you don't
copy the Half Life OEM's minidriver into your Quake or Quake 2 directories
that 3Fingers is sending around.  That miniGL was built specifically for
Half Life, and even tho it might get you a couple more frames/sec (can't
think of why...) if you alt tab out of Quake or Q2 while this is running,
you'll be introduced to a fun hard lock a lot of the time.  That's why those
drivers will never be released for Quake/Q2.  However, they work fine in
Half Life.  When there are newer drivers available, they will be available
for download immediately from the 3Dfx website (the one with the big green
monkey).

Of course, for those of you that just absolutely need those extra 2
frames/sec that your monitor won't even update because your vsync is off,
have at it.  But I really don't recommend it.  I wish people would just wait
till drivers are actually released before putting them in our customers'
hands.
