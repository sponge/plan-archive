Cool news!  Tim got Tribes support (when they release the next patch)
put into GameSpy!  Woo hoo!  Now you can find your friends on there and
stuff.  Not quite sure when we'll be releasing it, just wanted you all
to know it was coming!

Also, since I've seen so many confusing reports by the press lately on
the nature of 3D, thought I'd take the time to correct one of them:

Ummm, like *all* modern hardware has backface culling in hardware.
It's the first basic optimization anyone would do to reduce overdraw.
What they PROBABLY meant is that they do culling so they don't generate
or load lightmaps on to-be-culled surfaces or something.
