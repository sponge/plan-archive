Ok, no fooling now :) It turns out I'm indeed
going to Ritual, not Raven :)

Though I am guilty for getting Rick Johnson 
to thoroughly confuse everyone.  And though 
I did have Blue scrambling between him, Mark 
and me trying to get the answer, I didn't 
get the intended "well, I don't know what's 
going on post" on his page.  Oh well, cest la
vie.  At least I know I had his confused as 
hell :)

Basically, I tried to confuse everyone with 
the truth like I did 2 years ago when I 
announced QuakeSpy was going shareware on 
April Fool's Day, but since that didn't work 
this time, I had to employ Rick's services.  
Turns out I had some people emailing me that 
were fooled, so it was somewhat worth it.  
Hell, I had one guy emailing about how cool 
it was that Abrash was working at Ritual, 
and a message about 4 minutes later telling 
me how silly he was.  That's good stuff :)

So, that's that...  I'm starting at Ritual 
in like 2.5 weeks, should be fun stuff.  I'm 
really excited to be going there.  Of course
I'll still be with GameSpy, as I've been for 
over like 2 years.  So you cna reach me at 
either jack@gamespy.com or jack@ritual.com, 
I read both now.

On another note, see The Matrix right now. 
Great stuff, even though I wish Keanu could 
learn to change his voice or something. He's 
a decent actor, but man, he sounds like a 
stoner whenever he opens his mouth. I'll 
prolly be posting a review on sCary's Shack 
or something soon.
