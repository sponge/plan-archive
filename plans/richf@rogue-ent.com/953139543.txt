Plan:
Rogue needs more artists!

Now that we have more room in the galley, we need more artists to fill it. Rogue Entertainment is currently searching for at least one of each of the following to start immediately as a full time member of our crew: 

*3D Animator/modeler familiar with 3DS Max and Character Studio

*Concept/storyboard artist (Photoshop and/or Paint Shop Pro skills a plus)

*2D skin artist with Photoshop and/or Paint Shop Pro experience (Painter 3D a plus)

Industry experience would be another big plus though certainly not a requirement. Qualified artists should submit a resume and a portfolio using a variety of media, including a demo reel of their animation if applicable. Once we receive your submission, we will send you a copy of our Rogue Art Test to more fairly compare you with the other candidates on our list.

Good luck!
