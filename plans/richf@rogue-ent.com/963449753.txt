Texture submission cut-off!

Now that we are knee deep in submissions from talented texture artists, all we have to do is chose the best one for the job (no easy task let me tell you). We are still on the lookout for more skin artists and we will continue to accept skin artist applications until further notice but at this time we are no longer actively seeking new texture artist submissions. 

I'd like to take a moment and stress that anyone, be they artist or any other game related discipline, can send in examples of their work at any time. We never permanently close our doors to interested applicants even if we aren't hiring at that moment. We maintain a permanent file on anyone who submits work to us so that if we have a position open up in the future, we have a list of people that we can start contacting. We might not have the time in my schedule to personally critique each submission that comes across our desk but I assure you that we evaluate them all and file them for later reference.

For additional information about sending in your submissions, check out the "news" page of our site at:

To all the texture artists who have applied so far, keep your fingers crossed. We'll be making our final decision soon!
