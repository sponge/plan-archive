Artists galore!

Over the last few weeks we have been flooded with so many submissions for the skin artist position that it's taken us longer than usual to make our choice but we finally did it. We've had a ton of talented skinners send in artwork for consideration and review and it was a tough call to pick only one. I wanted to thank everyone who sent in submissions and remind you that your contact information will be kept on file and you will be notified if another position opens up in the near future.

Who are all these new people swelling the ranks and crowding the halls of Rogue Entertainment? Keep an eye on our "Crew" page as it will soon be updated with personal info and mug shots of the skilled artists, designers, programmers, and other all-around miracle workers who are busily striving to bring our creepy version of Wonderland to life.

As another reminder, there are still job opportunities available here at Rogue. If you are interested in applying and want more details, check out the "News" section of our site:
