Attention 2D artists!

Rogue is looking for another skilled texture and an additional skin artist to round out our existing art department. We are currently searching for:

* A versatile 2D texture artist with Photoshop and/or Paint Shop Pro experience. Knowledge of other paint programs would be helpful but not mandatory.

*A talented 2D skin artist with Photoshop and/or Paint Shop Pro experience (Painter 3D a plus).

Industry experience is not a requirement for either position but it would be a bonus in your favor. If you are a qualified artist, send in your resume and as many examples of your work as possible. After we review and file your artwork submission, we will send you a copy of the Rogue Art Test tailored to either the texture or skin position. This is just a quick test that all the candidates will take so that we can compare everyone's strengths and weaknesses more fairly. If you wish to test for both positions, you will be encouraged to complete one test before moving on to the next. Time is a factor in the rating of the test results.
