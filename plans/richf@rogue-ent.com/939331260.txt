Wow, I've received a ton of cool animations in the last few weeks! In fact, we've had to give a selected handful of the most talented animators individual tests to help narrow down our choices a bit more. It will still be a hard decision to make once everyone on our list get their tests reviewed but we are confidant that we'll be able to select the right person for the job from the dozens of submissions that we have already received.

I wanted to take a minute to thank all the highly skilled artists that have taken the time and effort to send their artwork submissions to be reviewed.
