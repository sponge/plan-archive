Attention all 3d artists!

We might just have a pirate hat with your name on it! Rogue Entertainment is 
currently searching for an animator/modeler with the right skills and attitude 
to immediately start as a full time member of our crew. All applicants must be 
familiar with programs like 3DS Max and Character Studio with additional 
proficiencies in Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, and Lightwave. Storyboard and 
conceptual talents are also a huge plus. Industry experience would be an even 
bigger plus (though not required). Qualified artists should be prepared to 
submit a resume and a portfolio using a variety of media, including a demo 
reel of their animation. 

For additional information, check out the employment opportunities section of 
our website at:

Good luck!
