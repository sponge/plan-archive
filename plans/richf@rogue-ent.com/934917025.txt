Alice needs you!

Rogue Entertainment is lookin' for more scurvy dogs! We are currently accepting applications for a 2d texture/skins artist who has what it takes to immediately start full time on our new "Alice" project. All interested artists must be proficient with 2d paint programs like Photoshop and/or Paint Shop Pro. Every applicant's portfolio should really showcase the effects and details that can be achieved with a 24 bit palette. Storyboard and conceptual talents are also needed. Industry experience would weigh heavily in your favor but it is not a requirement. Talented and qualified artists should be prepared to submit a resume and a portfolio using a variety of media, including a demo reel of their animation. 

For additional information, check out the "news" page of our new website at:

As a reminder, we are still accepting resumes and demo reels for the 3d artist position. Come join the Rogue crew as we set sail!
