Wow, it doesn't feel like we've been in the gaming business for 5 whole years. 
Time sure does fly when you lose sleep on a regular basis. Still, when all is 
said and done, I'd still go through it all over again (I'm damn glad I don't 
have to though!). In this crazy industry where companies come and go in the 
span of a few months, I consider this milestone a real validation that we are 
doing something right.

Jim did such a fine job of marking the occasion that I don't have much to add 
but I just wanted to thank every one of you out there who has supported us 
throughout the years. If it weren't for you, we'd probably have to go out and 
get real jobs *shudder*! We hope that you keep a close eye on us in the years 
to come and show the same awesome level of support for our future titles as we 
keep striving to give you all the same high quality of games that has become 
Rogue's trademark!
