I just wanted to take a minute to let everyone know that I am going to start narrowing down our choices for Rogue's new 2d artist within this week or so. If anyone is still gathering together materials for their last minute submission, please send them in before Friday the 3rd. Next week I'll be making a list of potential candidates to contact for interviews. 

We are still taking demo tapes and submissions for the 3d animator/modeler position so if you are still polishing up some animations to show us, you've got about another week or so before we start making our final list.

For additional information about sending in your submissions, check out the "news" page of our site at:

I also want to thank all of the skilled artists who have sent in artwork submissions. I've reviewed quite a lot of artwork from immensely talented people and I'm once again impressed with the drive and enthusiasm that most of the applicants have demonstrated. It's a shame that we can't hire up more of you! 

P.S. My big 30th birthday lunch yesterday at Maggiano's was a rousing success. I'm still packed to the gills with fine Italian food! I think it'll be "lite menu" selections for the rest of the week for me but it was well worth the bloating.
