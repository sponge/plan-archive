RECEPE FOR A BAD DAY!

There really is nothing quite like walking out to your car and noticing that 
it was broken into by some total waste of skin pretending to be a human being. 
This complete and utter bastard managed to get into my passenger side door 
even though it was parked on a busy street right in front of my snobby new 
apartment complex complete with a roving security nazis. My car was literally 
bracketed by a Porsche and a Lexus and they chose my 1993 Chevy Crapolier to 
cruelly rape for kicks. I say that they only did it for fun since they didn't 
break anything and nothing was stolen from the interior. Apparently they just 
wanted to throw my stuff around the inside and then close it back up again as 
some sick prank to start my day off on a bad note. Good thing I took all my 
guns, drugs, and porn out of the car earlier in the week. I wouldn't want them 
falling into the wrong hands.

The thing that really twists the knife is that they didn't even have the 
common decency to steal my piece of shit, just abuse it. The least they could 
have done was drive it into the Trinity river or burn it to the ground for me. 
I could have at least collected the insurance then. But no, I guess my poor 
car was too pathetic for the thieving S.O.B. to be seen driving around in. 
So now I'm left feeling not only violated, but inadequate too.

"Bunch of fuckin' savages in this town!"

I might just have to take some people up on their offer to join my personal 
death squad. I did get a lot of positive response to my last post. Hmmm...
