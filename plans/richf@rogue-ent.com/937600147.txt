WE'VE MADE OUR DECISION!

After carefully examining all of the fine artwork submissions that I've received (and believe me I've received a lot of them!), we've made our final selections for the 2d artist position. In a very close race, Christopher "Derelict" Green and Aaron Smith both narrowly edged out their competition for the parts. It was an extremely  tough call to make given the sheer number of talented artists who sent in applications, I really wish we could have hired more of you! 

On behalf of everyone here at Rogue, I want to thank you all for taking the time and effort to send in your artwork for review. We are keeping everyone's submissions in a permanent file for later review if we decide to hare another artist in the near future. If you have any question or comments regarding our decision, please feel free to contact me. I greatly enjoyed seeing your work and I imagine that I'll be seeing a lot more of it in the future

I also want to mention that for a limited time only, we are still accepting submissions for the 3d animator/modeler position. For additional information, check out the "news" page of Rogue's website at:

On a related note, the artists currently outnumber every other department here so if we were more organized and driven, we could stage a bloody coup and take over the Rogue offices. Fortunately for everyone else, artists are a notoriously shiftless and poorly motivated lot so we'll just get down to cranking out some killer artwork for "Alice".
