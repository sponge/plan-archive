Tic tock, tic tock...

My artwork submission box is almost full but there's still some room for a few more. In order to stem the tide of incoming demo reels (and get more artists in here sooner), we are going to stop accepting submissions as of Friday March 31st so if you have any last minute submissions that you are getting together, get them in the mail quick before it's too late. 

Just a reminder for artists interested in positions here at Rogue Entertainment, we are still accepting applications for at least one of each of the following:

*3D Animator/modeler familiar with 3DS Max and Character Studio

*Concept/storyboard artist (Photoshop and/or Paint Shop Pro skills a plus)

*2D skin artist with Photoshop and/or Paint Shop Pro experience (Painter 3D a plus)

Skilled candidates do not need industry experience but that would be a bonus in your favor. Qualified artists should send in their resume and as many examples of their work as possible, including a demo reel of their animation if applicable. After we review and file your submission, we will send you a copy of our Rogue Art Test so that we can compare all the candidates' strengths and weaknesses more fairly. 

For additional information, check out all of the employment opportunities here at Rogue on our official website at:

Good luck!
