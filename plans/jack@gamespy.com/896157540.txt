Leaving for E3 tomorrow, followed by a week of vacation to see my buds 
in Tallahassee.  Should be a fun two weeks, don't expect me to exactly 
reply promptly to my email :)

Got Unreal.  Very, very pretty game.  Excellant job on it, guys.  I 
especially dig the detail texturing...  Glad someone's finally using it!

Also, we needed to get some stuff into the fridge yesterday, and we 
found that Andrew is still the little pack rat, so without further ado,

And geez people, lay off on the whole "let's overanalyze everything 
Brian Hook says" thing.  Grow up.  He doesn't candycoat shit, so if you 
have to analyze something to get it out, then it's likely not what he's 
saying, cause he'll just flat out say it.  Egads.
