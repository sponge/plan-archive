4/10 - After midnight

Not too much to say about much really.  Let's start by saying that MOVING SUCKS.  The packing part really isn't so bad.  A bad part, though, is dealing with the movers.  Here's an abbreviation of 2 conversations I had.  The first is the appraiser, the equivilent of a moving salesperson.  Let's call this person "Person"

"Hi, so is this estimate like, the maximum price I'm going to pay"
"Yes."

Next day, talking to someone at the company (Other Person)...

"Hi there, Person told me that I wouldn't pay any more than the estimate."
"Really?  There's no paperwork on that, let me have Person call you about it."

... and then this message on the answering machine ...

"Hi Jack, this is Person.  Other Person told me that you said that I said that you wouldn't pay more than the estimate.  I didn't use those words, but I will come down to bring some paperwork this weekend for you to sign to do this!"

Great stuff.

I'd also like to congratulate 3dfx on the Voodoo3 launch.  The commercials kick ass, and I saw the actual boxes in Fry's today.  Great box art, great commercials, and the stock's kicking ass to boot!  Woo hoo!

Now I just can't wait to get to Ritual in about a week...  It'll be nice to have a job again.  Of course, I'll be on the road during my birthday which sort of suck.  C'est la vie, I suppose.

Oh yeah, Craig Kilborn's show on CBS after Letterman totally kicks ass.  Converted me over from Conan, since Conan is funny for about 10 minutes, and the Kilborn show is funny for about 60 minutes :)

Anyway, bye now.
