Well, some of you ran into our not quite finished April Fool's joke 
in GameSpy.  Umm, whoops :)

As for the real update, well, as most of you may or may not know, it 
was exactly one year ago today that GameSpy ( or rather, QuakeSpy ) 
went shareware.  That's right, it's been a whole year.  Anyway, to 
cut to the chase, we're going freeware again.  That's right, exactly 
a year after we start charging people, we've decided to give the power 
back to the people.  Now, registered users will still get the frills 
they were promised when they gave us their money, only everyone else 
will be getting them too!  Plus, for giving us $20, these people will 
now get a GameSpy 3D pencil set as a consolation prize!  It's really 
quite generous and we hope you appreciate it.

Thanks!

Haven't updated in a good two weeks.  Guess I've been a bit busy :)

For one, wanted to get something off my chest.  These new Surge 
commercials are pissing me off.  "Ok, I've put a can of Surge down, 
my buds have to run across of field of live land mines, the whole 
time jamming hot pokers up their asses."  I guess they're trying to 
say if you drink Surge, you'll do stupid, useless things?  Dunno. :)

Also, 16 days till the big 2-1...  That'll be cool.  And 17 till the 
big raping that the IRS will likely give me.  Ugh.  Talk about an 
upper/downer combo :)

It'll also be cool to have Steve Tietze up here, and Rob Huebner will 
be back after a hiatus in LA :)  Should be fun.

Hell, May's gonna rule too, with CGDC coming up, and E3.  Get to 
drink lots, spend time with cool people, and see ma and pa all at 
the same time.  Should be quite interesting...

...  Speaking of interesting, seems that a certain Dallas area game 
developer seems to enjoy calling my house when he's totally trashed.
I just find that pretty funny :)

GameSpy's also doing good.  We're *this* close to 2.0.  The TODO lists 
are really down there.  As soon as the bugs get reduced some more, I'm 
sure we'll have another private beta.  Whee.

YAWN!  Talk about tiring.  For anyone that's wondering, I went to 
London and Paris on business, and it was quite fun and quite 
exhausting.  I'm pretty much forcing myself to stay up so I can get 
used to time in the states.

Nearly caught up my GameSpy email, tomorrow I start on my 3Dfx email.
Ugh.

Oh, seems I got a cold.  It finally snuck thru from my lack of sleep 
today.  Damn it.

Also, today marks my 6 months at 3Dfx.  I'd thought it was yesterday, 
but I was wrong.  Cool, huh?

So I guess my plan is to sleep :-)

I really should be getting to bed about now.

I'm completely and totally drained.  A week of travelling, mostly to 
Dallas, today to Seattle.  Saw bunches of people I know, met a lot of 
new people, and lost my wallet.  So where does it turn up?  Brian 
Hook's desk.  I left it on his desk, dammit :) Oh well, I've done 
dumber things.  Gotta thank him for that, can't wait to hear how 
exactly he knew where I was when he found it.  He was about to tell 
except that we were late for the Seattle flight.

Now I have two days before flying out to Europe for 2 weeks on 
Sunday.  Plus I need to grab something in the city tomorrow.  Suffice 
it to say, I won't be showing up at 3Dfx longer than it takes me to 
pick up my replacement credit card :-)

This also blows, because I'm going to prolly have to work on GameSpy 
all day Saturday to boot.  And I can't sleep on planes, so needless 
to say, I will probably be a little bitch in the next few days as 
well.

Compounding this, Andrew brought home the Evil Puppy of Death again.  
I'm not sure if I updated about this thing that kept me awake for, 
oh, a whole night.  If I didn't, well, it did.  Anyway, so the next 
day, I tell him never to bring that fucking (yes, I said fucking) 
dog over again.  So I get back from this trip, and what comes 
running into the hallway but this dog.  Mind you, I love dogs, owned 
them my whole life, and this one's cute.  But I also enjoy sleep.  I 
enjoy knowing when I can and can't sleep.  I haven't had all that 
much sleep in the past four days.  If this Dachsund(sp?) barks once 
tonight, I think I'll just go and step on it.  I have a bad feeling 
about this.  The same deadly combo as last time.  Give it utter and 
complete attention for 5 hours, then throw it in a cage on the floor 
next to you.  Not a good combonation.  

Oh, I've gots to talk about the fun airplane ride to Seattle.  Big 
storm, we had to go around.  Had to refuel in Salt Lake City.  Four 
hours late.  Totally sucked.  I was just commenting on the fact that 
sleep would FINALLY happen, then this happens.  To boot, I get quite 
terrified when the environment around me so much as shakes.  This 
ride was a veritable blender of horror.

In fact, one of the things keeping me sane on this trip (besides my 
invisible friend Pepe) was a book that was actually given to me by 
a friend in college a year back called 'Snow Crash.'  Wow.  I 
haven't been able to put this thing down, it's incredibly good.  I 
highly recommend it.  Hopefully it'll keep me sane while standing 
in line in the city tomorrow.

Oh, saw Onethumb's new digs, Gary McT's new eyes, Hook's ultra-turbo 
Volvo, Billy's hair sans bleach, and various cool things at various 
companies that I variously can't talk about :)

Oh, and Mark Dochtermann is an old fart.  In case anyone was 
wondering :-)
