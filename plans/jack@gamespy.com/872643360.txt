Ok, well, time for a big rant on my part.  This rant is towards the 
people at GameCenter.  Normally, I like their stuff.  Hell, they 
interviewed me once :)  But there seems to be a major journalistic 
chip on their shoulder towards a company that has completely embraced 
this community -- 3DFX.  

If you look in their Game News section, you will see an article titled 
"3Dfx Steps in It...Again."  In this fun article, they say that the 
first time they "stepped in it" was by putting a big amount of support 
behind Intergraph.  Now mind you, this was at the unveiling of the 
Voodoo of the Intergraph and I believe that Intergraph is the only 
company making both Rush and Voodoo cards, and has probably made deals 
to support 3dfx in the future.  Plus, since EA distributes these cards, 
and people trust EA, it means more sales.  Period.  So why *shouldn't* 
3dfx throw the brunt of their support behind the people most supporting 
their technology?  Ok, now, note that Gamecenter did this in their 
"Game News" section, instead of Xperts section, where most of the 
editorial goes.  I guess Mr. Brown just isn't an Xpert.  

Now comes to a previous article, where Gamecenter got "confidential" 
documents from 3DFX.  This article was funny, because it is 
intentionally slanted to be towards PowerVR, even though it ended up 
being pro-3dfx.  First, let me mention that the responses GameCenter 
got from John Carmack and Mark Dochtermann could not have been the 
only ones, as for this type of article, they are hand-picked.  Two, 
this presentation was never presented and is 6.5 months old.  There are  
wonderful quotes like:

"Is there substance to 3Dfx's criticisms of PowerVR, or is 3Dfx merely 
trying to muddy the waters to fend off an aggressive competitor?"  

Tell me, if they tried to "muddy the waters" then why oh why did they 
never RELEASE this presentation?  This would be GameCenter trying to
throw jealousy in.

"Gamecenter polled a number of developers for a reality check."

Implying guilt for the USA Today readers who don't feel like hitting 
"Give Me More!"

"Based on the analysis of Carmack and Dochtermann, 3Dfx has superior
--though more expensive--technology than NEC/VideoLogic, but some of 
3Dfx's claims are a bit over the top."

This is just too funny.  They HAVE to put a negative in that statement.  
Cheaper does not mean better, but a clever use of the word "though" 
implies that the expensive part offsets the superior part.

First thing they talk about is degradation from the tiling.  JohnC 
correctly says that:

"Theoretically, there should be no visible way to tell that a scene 
was rendered with a tiled architecture. Driver bugs may very well 
make this not true, though. "

Of course, if the rendering is flawed, then it will look bad, 
empirical evidence can be found at Zanshin's dojo.

"Since images are copied from PowerVR to a 2D accelerator over the 
PCI bus, visual tearing artifacts are very noticeable."

This is _the_ over-the-top claim.

The next question talks about a lack of bilinear filtering and lack 
of alpha in PCX1.  Now PCX2 HAS this, yet Gamecenter still solicited 
an answer from JohnC which basically says this.  We all knew this, but
GameCenter includes this, apparently, as a way 3dfx was trying to be 
shifty, otherwise they would have thrown the answer away, because it 
is a totally moot point.

I love this quote from JohnC, btw: "PCX2 still lacks some of the 
blending modes, like src*dst, which is needed to get colored lighting 
in Quake 2. " which just goes in passing.

The next claim, about the lack of OGL, is mentioned, but noone talks 
about the fact that without the stuff above (like alpha blending) they
cannot make even a Quake minidriver with PCX1.  Here's the quote that 
was really important: "PowerVR, in its current state."  Remember, the
current state at the time was PCX1.  Another moot question.

The next question is about game developers wanting triangles, which 
John and Mark agree to, but state that PCX2 (2!!) in native mode will
be good.  John then stresses again that developers don't want PCX's 
native mode tho.

Another triangle question, with basically the same answer.

Then a D3D claim which Kevin Bachus answers is true :)

Then they ask Kevin about D3D where he says "I dunno."  I have no idea 
why they printed this.

Then they mention something else to Kevin where he answers that they 
don't look at the items in that question when certifying hardware for
D3D.  Of course, we don't find out what they DO look for, so...

Now in the first page (USA Today version) they said they spoke to 
NEC and got their reaction.  Guess I missed that part.  In fact, that 
part wasn't there.  Also, like a good journalistic monkey, they didn't 
then mention any of the shortcomings in the NEC artitecture that were 
brought about by the interview.  Nothing like "Though one of 3dfx's 
claims were over the top, it is apparent that for then, the NEC 
hardware was vastly inferior to 3dfx, even though this may not be the 
case now."

None of this was said.  With all of that, there is one last thing that 
proves to me there must be some sort of bias.

The article titled "Sega and 3Dfx call it quits."

This article is basically about the ball Sega dropped on 3dfx.  Now, 
Sega did not respond to Gamecenter, and 3DFX told them that it had been 
reaching all of its milestones on time.  Where is the investigative 
reporting?  Where is the commentary that 3DFX's hardware is indeed 
better than what PowerVR has shown thus far?  Instead, Gamecenter turns 
a quote into something much worse than what it meant:
Is 3Dfx bitter about Sega's decision? Kramer's final comment to 
Gamecenter this morning spoke volumes: "It's been four years since 
Sega has done anything right." 
So they take this quote to mean bitterness, instead of happening to 
mention that the Saturn is technologically inferior.  That an upstart 
like Sony could come in and take away Sega's stranglehold on the 
console market because of better marketting and technology.

Now I don't know if there's bad blood between Gamecenter and 3dfx, but 
this is completely and utterly ridiculous, and all of this posted under 
"Game News."  Sick.

Gotta love the web based .plan updating.  Just a few days into my
vacation and I have 319 mail messages, none of which I've read. :)

Just thought I'd say hey and also, I know who foxed Zanshin.  The
Communists.  He was developing his GL for the red bastards when he 
decided to be patriotic instead!  He should be applauded!

For one, since I can't get to the installer source code, we've 
figured out indeed how useful that was.  It seems lots of people are
having WAY too much trouble installing the betas.  For one, lemme 
recommend www.winzip.com.  If you are getting gfx.wad errors, you're 
not running it from the Quake directory!  Nonetheless, me and Zoid 
have decided to wait until the installer's back (in about a week and
a half) before releasing 2.01, which fixes the color mapping problem
in GL and might have a cool water thing, too.  Now, the server will
prolly be released tomorrow (2.01) which will fix the crashing 
spectators bug, add a few QC hooks for spectators to do admin stuff,
and a few other things Zoid will undoubtably put in the release 
notes.

Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to give the ultra-cool news yet, 
and I'm off in my brand-spankin' new Toyota T-100 to South Florida
tomorrow, and I won't be back for like 10 days.  I'll prolly update 
down there tho.  Keep that in mind when sending me email.

Oh, and you gotta love when girls wear knee-high black boots :)

First, a small GL thing.  It's slower because there's less status 
bar, thus more screen area to draw.  Dammit.  Watch what you wish 
for, it may come true :)  And combat is still MUCH faster.

The QW/QSpy/id website release went really well.  The Quake well was
getting a little dry lately, hopefully this helped some.

Also, prepare for a damned cool update by me on Monday or Tuesday...

I just need to vent about something, and not one of the trendy 
things to bitch about either.  It's about playing in peace.  It 
seems that every time I join a server now, people take that as an 
opportunity to ask me when QSpy will be out or when QW will be out 
or if I've added something new to GLQW.  I really don't understand 
it.  I'm there to play and enjoy myself like the next guy, and 
people are actually saying "Well?!" when I ignore their first 
question, and say "hi" to a friend of mine who just said hi to me.
Please stop this.  I'm sure I speak for all that "celebs" in this
community when I ask to please stop this now.  It's one thing to say
hey or something, it's a complete other thing to do shit like "Will
I be able to run GLQW on my Verite?" or "Are you THE morbid?" or
"Can I beta QSpy/QuakeWorld?" or something like that.  Questions 
belong in email, not when I happen to pop into the server and it's 
convenient for YOU to ask me questions.  I'm right there, why not? 
Because it's rude as hell, that's why.

While I'm on my bitch spree, something else I'd appreciate.  Please 
don't email me asking for betas of QW and QSpy.  We have plenty of 
testers, whether or not you're a "professional" or not makes no 
difference to me.  That point is, I feel like a shithead replying to
people having to say no.  I don't like saying no, but I have to, and
it makes ME feel like the shithead because I know they did nothing
wrong and they are just curious and honestly want to be helpful.
AND *please* for the love of god, don't add me to your ICQ unless I
know you or you REALLY have a valid reason.  One person requested 
THREE times in a row to be on my list, after I refused him telling 
him I only use ICQ for personal matters, and he was the first person 
I've moved to my ignore list.  Sigh.

Just listened to QuakeCast and noticed the INTENSE confusion with
NOSKINS on there.  NOSKINS 2 is in the beta of QuakeWorld right now,
but here's the description of the NOSKINS settings:
NOSKINS 0 - Downloads and uses skins.
NOSKINS 1 - Does not download and does not use skins.
NOSKINS 2 - Does not download new skins, but will use the skins you
already have.
Note that NOSKINS 2 in the current release does the same thing as 
NOSKINS 1, and the next version of QSpy will have the new NOSKINS 
options for the new (now in beta) client.  Hope this clears stuff 
up.  :)

Man, I sure am updating often.  Just wanted to say a few things...  
For one, got a neat effect in where rocket trails actually "fade"
off now in GL.  Also, I'm now uploading partial lightmaps, so that 
should help dynamic light performance a little.  Which also leads to 
the fact that I'm now working on the GL miniport.  Why?  Well, so 
when I want a little more of GL implemented, I can just switch over 
to the GL project and add it without bugging the 3dfx guys (seems 
TexSubImage2D didn't support GL_LUMINANCE, which is what Quake uses 
for lightmaps.  Didn't support glColor4ub, which is what I wanted 
for the particles.  Also, I have to thank Gary McTaggart over at 
3DFX for giving me pointers on the 8-bit stuff (and telling me it 
even existed!) and for tossing me the GL miniport codebase.  This 
guy does (and did) a lot more for GLQuake than most people know, and
I thought he should be acknowledged.

Updated - 7/29/97 - 1:45am -----------------------------------------

Redwood is so funny :) The reason for the sky slowdown is because 
places with sky are large areas, and texture thrashing is going on.
The 8-bit texture code in the next versions of GLQuake and GLQW 
should help this out a lot, but will not totally eliminate it.  
Also, as Redwood reported, I have added floodprots into the server.
Now, in case anyone was wondering, it's very configurable.  You can
specify the # of messages/# of seconds before someone is locked out,
and you can then specify the # of seconds they are silenced.  Also,
the first message they get is configurable, which is why "herd" was
spelled wrong in Red's screenshot :)

Also, get the GLIDE 2.4 runtimes.  They fixed the GL alt-tab bug!
Kudos to 3DFX!

I've also been on QuakeCast twice (http://www.pseudo.com).
Listen to it!

Ummmm...  Don't eat yellow snow...  And please register QSpy.  

I think Pauly's sitcom is gone!  w00!
