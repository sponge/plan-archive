I'm not dead!  Wheeeeeeee!!!

Happy Birthday to Gary McTaggart!!! It's his 28th this year. . . he'll
finally be able to dip into his social security and stuff like that.
Hmmm, I wonder what kind of walker they've given him?

Hehehee, just kidding Gary.  Actually, his birthday really was Monday, 
and I really did mean to phone him on my cell phone in a drunken 
stupor, but I forgot it. :)
