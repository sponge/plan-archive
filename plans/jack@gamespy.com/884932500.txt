GameSpy front:
Really banging away on GameSpy.  Got a lot of the code cleaned up 
in the process of fixing up the UI.  A few days ago, I was at a 
point where every time I would pull one thing out, everything else 
would fall into it's place.  It was quite frustrating.  So for the 
past two days, I've been in a perpetual daze after work thinking 
about this stuff.  I thought I had come up with something yesterday 
that seemed to make everything easier and prettier.  Tim Cook 
rightfully showed me my place there :) Also, onethumb gave me the 
wise reminder that I can't just keep adding stuff in and fixing 
everything at once.  So yesterday, out of frustration, I read the 
Alan Cooper book instead.  Tonight, I came in with a fresh view 
of what I had to do, looked at my todo list, and starting sticking 
to it.  Without improving everything, code starting falling into 
place, and everything is making sense now.  Abstraction is the key.  
If something has an insane set of 'cases' that are done all the 
time, wrap a class around it.  If the global list is handling 
the updating of individual server lists (like masters or web pages)
wrap a class around the server lists, so you can say
"Ok, I don't care what kind of server list you are, but I see that 
you are selected, you are a server list, update yourself."  This 
is better than saying "Okay, if the selected server list is a 
Quake server list, then do this to update yourself.  However, if 
the selected list is a QuakeWorld server list, then do this to 
update yourself..." ad nauseum...  See my point now?  Another 
example: 
Good:
A server list says "if this server belongs to me, then take me 
out of there" instead of the global list saying "if this server 
is QuakeWorld and its ms variable contains these, then run the 
QuakeWorld serverlist parsing routine.  If the server is Quake 
and the pages variable contains..." ad nauseam.
This archtecture then allows me to do this super cool loop to 
draw the bar on the left:
"For each server type, put a button, then for each list under 
that type, put an indented button."
I think you can figure out the alternative, and no, it's not 
pretty.  Now, after I'm done with this, the server class will 
need a bit of work so every game doesn't have the info for an
rcon password :) Then the view will need work so that columns 
can be different for any time.  Then the player view...
But that's for another time.  I'm not working on that now, nor 
will I be for a bit :)

3Dfx front:
While I was tearing through the minidriver today populating my 
geometry class, I noticed a bit of an oversight on some math 
routines which is an easy fix.  Not sure about exactly how much 
this will affect people, but I'll keep ya'll posted as to 
whether or not an update will be necessary.

Book front:
This About Face book has really done that to me.  It's made me 
look a whole nother ( Yeah, I know it's not a word.  Bite me. )
direction towards user interfaces.  Wow.  Alan Cooper is so 
completely ahead of his time.  This book was written right as 
Windows 95 was about to come out, and his thoughts are so 
completely true today, and Microsoft applications are starting 
to practice what he preaches.  It's pretty exciting to have 
your entire view about an aspect of computers be turned upside 
down by one little book.  I'm blasting through the last 50 or 
so pages tonight, but WOW, what an excellent read.

BTW, webmasters, if you link this, please use www.clbooks.com.
Thanks.

Toilet paper front:
John "Lone^Wolf" Campbell has taken it upon himself to take a 
survey of the toilet paper situation, I suggest you 
participate.  You can find info at his .plan, which is linked

There.  Dunno why it says "support onethumb's cause" all over 
it tho, he's jumping ship soon!  No aftermath for Don! :)
BTW John, you can add two people to the two ply list, Jack 
Mathews (Sr.) and Connie Mathews, who both wrote Andrew in 
favor of their son.  Maybe I'll put the emails on the GameSpy 
site, they're both really funny...

Other:
Guess Blue doesn't love me.  Been updating everything from the 
ridiculous to the extremely technical, all across the spectrum, 
and not even a mention in the et cetera section!   Steve!  Is 
it the $12 I owe you?  I'll pay it back, honest!  :)

FUCK YOU, MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ 5.0!!!!!

Want to know why I just did that?  Because I just lost about an
hour's work on GameSpy.  Doing what?  Right clicking!  I fucking
right clicked on a god damned part of my document, moved to
something in the menu, and the fucking thing stopped responding to
me!  Argh!  The worst part is, this is like the 3rd or 4th time
this has happened to me.  Of course normally, I'll do a build
every now and then to save everything, but I have been "coding
blind" for the past couple days with GameSpy, simply because I
know my code won't compile.  So I've made all these fucking great
changes to the code, happily in a good state of flow when this
happens.  All because this stupid program can't use stupid normal
menus like every other stupid program on this fucking planet.  And
yeah, I know I should save, but for something like this?!  Come on!

Addendum: And fuck you Basty for making me send this in txt file
format, dammit. :)
