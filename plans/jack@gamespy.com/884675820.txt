FUCK YOU, MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ 5.0!!!!!

Want to know why I just did that?  Because I just lost about an
hour's work on GameSpy.  Doing what?  Right clicking!  I fucking
right clicked on a god damned part of my document, moved to
something in the menu, and the fucking thing stopped responding to
me!  Argh!  The worst part is, this is like the 3rd or 4th time
this has happened to me.  Of course normally, I'll do a build
every now and then to save everything, but I have been "coding
blind" for the past couple days with GameSpy, simply because I
know my code won't compile.  So I've made all these fucking great
changes to the code, happily in a good state of flow when this
happens.  All because this stupid program can't use stupid normal
menus like every other stupid program on this fucking planet.  And
yeah, I know I should save, but for something like this?!  Come on!

Addendum: And fuck you Basty for making me send this in txt file
format, dammit. :)

A few things to update about.

Q2 Stuff:
Onethumb showed me a few days back that Brian's mouse wheel fixes
made it into Q2 3.10!  W00000!  Here's exactly how to take full
advantage of it with the inventory stuff he described:

bind MOUSE3 "invuse"
bind MWHEELDOWN "invprev"
bind MWHEELUP "invnext"

Then it just totally rules.  When you pick up an item, though, it
automagically becomes selected in your inventory, which sorta
threw me off a bit :) Now I find the only problem is deciphering
the little symbols representing weapons in the status bar.  Oh well,
maybe I'll just change the PCX's to just be "1" - "0".

GameSpy Stuff:
Worked *really* hard this weekend on fixing up GameSpy to be the
way it should be.  I really haven't even gotten to the UI part yet,
but that should be cake.  Right now, I'm reorganizing the way
the servers interact with the server sources (server lists).
Right now, we have all these oddball checks to see if things are
QuakeWorld, or Quake, or Hexen2, or Q2.  It's really out of hand.
It's not like it's anyones fault or anything, just that we really
didn't see what QuakeSpy would have become.  For the individual
servers, this is more or less done, as we have a CServer class
that we make calls to, which get routed to the right server-type
handling code by C++ for us.  But we still have these insane
QuakeWorld interception calls.  Not only that, but adding stuff
to the left is a complete bitch, and the code is just plain
unwieldy for it.  So now, there will be two new base classes,
CServerSourceType and CServerSource.  Each CServerSourceType is
a game type, such as Quake, or QW.  It will contain CServerSources,
which will be subclassed depending on the type.  Each server will
have a list of CServerSources it belongs to, all guaranteed to
have the same type.  The CServerSourceType will do all the
bookkeeping I need, so for each game, I just subclass it (i.e.
CQuakeServerSourceType ) and pop in whatever code is specific
to that.  The servers will have no idea what type they are, just
that they are servers, and they fall under some category.  It's
good stuff, but it's a buttload of code to re-work in GameSpy.
I've spent most of the weekend doing this, and plan on spending
a lot of my weeknights this week doing it too, but in the end, it
should lead to a less bug-prone UI and an easier life for me, Joe,
and Tim.

Toilet Paper Stuff:
It seems Andrew 'Wireless' Gibbons, mine and ot's roommate, has
been extolling the virtues of cheap one-ply toilet paper in his
.plan.  He needs to be taught a lesson, otherwise more and more
guests in our house will be having to wash their hands REAL good
before leaving the restroom.  Please send your thoughts on the
matter to:

You'll be glad you did.

Well, that sure was a long ass vacation.  Went back to Georgia to
see my folks, saw a bit of snow while I was there.  BTW, anyone
needing a competent CS major in the Atlanta area, hire Zach
Gaskins right now.  Email me if you need contact info for him.
Anyway, back to the update :)  After all the Xmas stuff (where I
got a cool South Park shirt and hat, btw), I went down to LA for
New Years and DaKCon, which was pretty damned fun.  DM'd Quake 2
till the wee hours of the night and a bunch of us took advantage
of the cable modem hookup to get lots of pr0n.  In fact, it was
all stored on SwanSong's machine.  So make fun of him and stuff.
Actually, he's a kick ass deathmatcher.  I expected him to be a
bit arrogant based on shit he's said, but he's really a great guy.
Also, re-met the guy who did Veldrin1.bsp, and we made a small
lil mod called Railgun Alley that we'll be releasing as soon as I
can axe one bug in the 3.05 source.  Of course, I don't know it
that well yet...  Oh well.  So that was vacation.

Oh, and sorry the new Shadow Warrior patch isn't out yet.  Turns
Out a few issues cropped up like right after I left.  Should be
soon.

BTW, kudos to John Cash for the status bar layout interface.
At first, I thought it really sucked until Zoid pointed out to
me how it's REALLY supposed to be used, then I figured out how
flexible it actually is.  Kick ass!

Also, wanted to thank Kyle Bousquet for sending me one of the
coolest movies ever made - Transformers. :) He sent it awhile
back and I forgot to thank him.  Whoops.

Oh, wanna hear something odd, my mom has QuakeFinger linked.
She found it all on her own and shit.  Weird.

Re: Railgun Alley.  Onethumb thinks it sucks, he's really wrong.
:)

Also, on the GameSpy front, the 2.0 codebase will finally be nice
and clean again.  Tim's doing kick ass networking stuff, while
I'll be writing a few classes to really simplify the interfaces
between the UI and the games.  I'll be diving back into THAT bad
boy tonight, after a bit of reading...

...  What will I be reading you ask?  Welp, a REALLY incredible
book called "About Face" by Alan Cooper, who is the guy who came
up with Visual Basic's UI.  He really has insight into how
computers should work with people, the problems with engineers
see differently from end users, and soooo many cool examples to
back it up.  If there's one thing I've been aiming for in
GameSpy, it's ease of use mixed with a slick interface.  This
book will starting playing a HUGE role in GameSpy's interface,
possibly for 2.0.  You'll be seeing less annoying stuff like
dialog boxes and unnecessary error messages.  There's a few
points about the document/application interface that I don't
agree with, but it's an excellent read.

Whew!  Right before I visit ma and pa for Christmas, I get the
cool ass options tree control in for GameSpy 2.0.  That means that
while I'm eating turkey or ham or whatever mom decides to cook, Joe
can begin putting that bad boy into player profiles and stuff! :)
But really, it's brought the options down to 5 tabs for now and
will be 4 once I get the "Proxy" tab under the networking section
of the tree as soon as Tim finishes with it.  I may even be able
to squeeze sounds down there, but not Chat, Filters, or Server
Lists.  Now I get to work on a happy-fun UI overhaul.  Yippie
shit. :-)
Let's see, other stuff...  Saw the new Bond flick, twas great.  You
Just can't get the kind of feelings you get in a Bond movie.  You
know he can't die, you know the first thing he trys at the enemy's
base will never work, you know the main enemy will catch his and
leave him unattended during an easily escapable situation, you know
that the forboding guy that's been 'just missing' fighting Bond will
end up with a really long fight and the end of the movie, that he
will always get the good girl, that Q will always get him new toys,
et cetera.  Oh, and don't bring up "You Only Die Twice," I know he
'died' in that, smartass.  My point is, they keep this series fresh.
Michelle Yeow was incredible, Teri Hatcher, well, sucked.  And
what's also cool are the new recurring characters.  Namely, the new
M and Joe Don Baker (forgot the name in the movie).
Also saw Titanic.  I pretty much agree with what Rick Johnson had
to say about it.  I had honestly thought that this one would royally
bite, excepting the beginning and the end.  However, the middle *was*
filled with a love story, but a very strong one.  I'm usually not one
to like a movie like this, but every part about it, from writing, to
acting, to execution, was just utter perfection.  The scenes of the
ship sinking were breathtaking.  I was looking REALLY hard for CGI,
and the only time I could spot it was one of the people falling.
That's it.  And I know that this movie was chock full of CGI too.
Four stars without a doubt.  Plus, Leo di Caprio played a boy named
'Jack,' so I'm gonna get some great wave files from this one :-)

That's about it.  Have a Merry Christmas everyone.

First things first, a new update to the miniport is available.
I've written installers for both of them even though they're both
the same.  Why?  Because there are WAY too many problems otherwise.

GLQuake:
http://asp.planetquake.com/dl/dl.asp?miniport/glqminiinst.exe

Quake 2:
http://asp.planetquake.com/dl/dl.asp?miniport/q2miniinst.exe

This mainly fixes the window movement bug on the Rush, and the
memory leak in Quake 2 when using vid_restart.

Also, something
