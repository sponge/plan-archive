I realized today that writing software for other people can be really
rewarding, really depressing, or both at the same time.

Thus, from now on (a few months back on, really), I'm going to focus
on writing software for myself, and sometimes other people. 

(Update: just to clarify, I mean, writing software that other people
will use. And give suggestions, and so on. Not necessarily what other
people want you to make. )
