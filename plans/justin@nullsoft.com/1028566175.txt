Plan:
in salamanca now. very good place.
have had a good week or so.
san sebastian was OK, not very good food, sleepy town, good radiohead
concert though, and they were staying in our hotel (big plus, hanging 
out having a drink in our hotel bar when in walks the band, heh).

paris was cool, got to meet some of christophes friens, and then not 
understand them when they all spoke french. good food, good times.

salamanca seems to be good all around. anyway. no radiohead in our 
hotel it appears, but free minibar (yay).

been working on some really neat projects on my laptop too. tasty.

Peace out.

Oh, and Spanish keyboards are much preferable to French ones.
