10/7/01 - Ahh symmetry.

Allison and I went to a firefighter's breakfast this morning. It
was good, even though I woke up with a sore throat.

When we got home, sitting in the car, we saw a turkey walking down
our street. It walked by, and looked at something in our neighbors 
driveway. I don't know who that turkey was or where he was going,
but I hope he finds what it is he was looking for.

You don't really see turkeys around here very much.
