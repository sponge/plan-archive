So we brewed a shitstorm a few weeks (months?) ago, and soon the results
will be getting to the public. So I want to lay it out for eveerybody here.


What is going to happen?

Next week or maybe the week after, we will be releasing Winamp 2.9. The
expected changes from 2.8 will be:
  * Video support (Directshow formats and NSV)
  * Media library support (This rocks! Includes a lot of things including
    SHOUTcast listing support, CD support, portable device support via plugins
    and an API (we will release an iPod plugin and Nomad Jukebox plugin to 
    start))
  * A _bunch_ of new plugin API/IPC calls for plugins to use. These include
    things like generic window frame creation for tighter integration.
  * Digital CD extraction for CD playback
  * a lot of other fixes and improvements.

This should be happening very soon.

So the question that people might be wondering is, what does this mean for 
Winamp 2 vs Winamp 3 etc? Well, here is the plan:

  * We release Winamp 2.9 with a lot of the bulk functionality that we have in 
    Winamp 3 (videoand  media library support being two of them)
  * We work on integrating some of the Winamp 3 features that we want into the
    Winamp 2.9 platform, including the hot Winamp 3 skin support. 
  * We spend a little bit of time adding the features we wanted in Winamp 3
    into this new version, including CD ripping and burning, which will be very
    hot. The new media library will enable a lot of this, and make it very easy
    to integrate.
  * ?????
  * We profit.
 
All in all, by this summer, we should have some very interesting product
(read: something that performs like Winamp2.x, has all the skin support of
Winamp 3, more features including CD ripping and burning, and is overall
very solid and functional.) 

And in the next couple of weeks, you will see Winamp 2.9, which will give you
a good preview of whats to come.

This is what will (hopefully) be happening. We are all tremendously excited,
stay tuned.
