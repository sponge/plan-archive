Back in the brown house. Had a good week away with the entire family.

That Pixies song from the Fight Club soundtrack ("Where is My Mind")
is in my head - good song.

Ah yes, coming back to a three day weekend is good, aside from 
the fact that I can't pick up my mail til tuesday.

Sleepy. Girl made good dinner. Head hurting though. Mmm.

I put some new images on blorp.com, and some more free software
on http://www.nullsoft.com/free/

Spent a couple of hours cleaning up/fixing aO, that old user interface
experiment I started years ago. Thinking I should release it, code and
all, soon.. We'll see.

Banacek is the best damned show on TV today. It's on at 2am on Friday 
mornings on A&E (I think). Fucking brilliant. Brennan will agree.

Allison and I were watching an E! True Hollywood story about Savannah,
the porn star.. and they mentioned she was in a porn movie near the end
of her career (I believe it was called Starbangers 1), where she has sex
with 8 guys at the same time... Which left us both wondering, how do you 
have sex with 8 guys at the same time??? I mean, if they are taking turns,
does that count as "at the same time"? 

Update at 11:41pm: 
<`db> HSAHAHAHAHHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaa
<`db> you're kidding
<`db> that has to be the most bizarre, hilarious, thing, I've ever heard

It really was, quite funny.
