Plan:
The fight on terrorism is not something the military or goverment can 
succeed in. It's something we need to do as individuals. Terrorists 
are willing to sacrifice everything including their lives for their 
beliefs. We need to be able to sacrifice OUR lives for OUR beliefs. 

If your flight is hijacked, fight back. 50 unarmed average americans can 
easily take 4 terrorists with knives -- with probable losses, yes.

Today we have less to fear than before. Security has been improved, and 
Americans are so aware and pumped full of andrenaline, terrorists are 
not going to have a chance.

Hijacking will never be the same. No longer will people hijack planes
with the intention of going somewhere else to escape. The risk of being
rushed and beaten by the passengers would just be too high. People now
are angry, and won't take the shit sitting down. People aren't going to
cower in their seats, hoping to live. They're going to take action.
And Terrorists should know this.

The more this kind of shit happens, too, the stronger we will get.

Right now America is Edward Norton after the first fight (with himself,
err, Brad Pitt) in Fight Club.

You can take a few of us, but in the end we'll kick your asses.
