Plan:
so many different belief systems.
it's amazing to think that the mormon missionaries on the bus today
believed in what they believe as much as i believe the things i
believe, even if they are completely different. i base mine on a 
combination of what i've been told and what i've learned and 
what makes sense. what do they base theirs on? what they've been
told and what they've learned and what makes sense. to them. 
there are no absolutes. 
no mistakes, just memories. i like that phrase. 

anyway, i go to bonnie's birthday pool party. hopefully. it is getting late.
