dear god make the bad man stop

maybe it would be easier to just decide that hey, we should just give in and
sell out and make winamp suck. yeah, we should put the AOD in everything (every
time you run winamp, it should drop AOL icons everywhere), we should put ads in 
the player, we should just give in and help drive this company into the ground.
Management is doing such a wonderful job of it now, we should just join in.

I remain the spam king of nullsoft, yay

With the launch of winamp 2.90, we will patent our new Non-Linear Versioning
Process. NLVP removes all of the common versioning-space issues, and prevents 
users from determining which version of a program is right for them. Once we
receive the patent from the patent office, we will agressively pursue any
company that makes the mistake of using NLVP. Consider yourself warned. It
is only a matter of time.

Fritz also had these words to share:
"I'm also giving informational lectures about the cheese hat, holding still 
life watercolor courses with the cheese hat as the subject, and taking the 
cheese hat around to Children's Hospitals so that disadvantaged and sick 
children can appreciate its might and glory.  Mostly just bummed and vagrants 
show up to the weekly series of informationals and lectures, but last week, 
Ricardo Montalbon  happened to be in Santa Cruz and he has some very 
enlightening ideas about how the cheese hat, if the cheese were real, could 
feed his extended family now living in Columbia."

Well put.
