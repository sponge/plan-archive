phew.  things are getting back to normal. 

Made a cool template generator for nsis: 
http://firehose.net/free/nsis/maketemplate.html

Thinking about making a zip->exe converter using nsis (i.e. it would unpack everything, 
write out a .nsi file, compile it, and delete all the temporary stuff. For comparison,
WinZip's sfx adds ~28k, and NSIS adds 32k (though if I took out a lot of the unused 
options in NSIS, that goes down substantially). Would be fun, and help all the people
who package up their plug-ins / avs presets for winamp.com.

Just bought the newest Hooverphonic CD (some songs are damned good, others are quite
strange, but I'll give a full review later) and the Requiem for a Dream soundtrack.
Word.

Heading to New Orleans tomorrow morning. Early. Will take lots of pictures.
