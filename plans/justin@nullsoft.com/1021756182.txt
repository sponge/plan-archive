Plan:
[we originally got .plans figuring that we'd get ferraris too, like id]

I lub reinventing the wheel, when there are advantages to doing so.

big wheels keep on turning.

I'm in North Carolina with Al for a wedding.
Reading Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon. The part on page 60 or so
with Randy and his falling out with Andrew, was, well, familiar. Something
I identified with. Heh. People.

The neat thing about Cryptonomicon is that it is mixing fiction with fact
so well, that I sometimes can't tell =) I'll do some serious research on
some of it later to see what really happened.
