happy pi day (heh). I wish I had updated this at 1:59 am or something, but
I missed that chance.

poor jonathan broke his arm snowboarding a few weeks ago, and had to have
surgery. poor bastard. send him pron (jonathan@winamp.com).

wa2.9 is coming along nicely, and we should be releasing it around the 26th..
Mainly waiting for Jonathan and Steve to all be around.. Christophe and I will
probably put a beta of it on the Winamp.com forums next week, so if you're
interested keep your eyes open then...

Fun fun fun.
