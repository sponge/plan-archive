Sitting on a bench in Solano Beach. Soon I will likely live (most of the time) here. Yay.

Funny things happen to your mind after driving 450 miles. Sometimes the least rational things make the most sense.
If you think about it, and any rational solution to a complex problem isn't perfect, then the problem
is more complex than you thought.

Anyway, I'm going to try and introduce an arbitrary variable, and see what happens. It makes perfect sense right now.

If all goes as planned, I'll end up with a super crappy and super expensive old stand up piano.

Allison and I just ate dinner at On The Border in Pleasanton. 
Bit of a drive to LA ahead of us. Tough decisions lie ahead.

Woop Tom and I made it so I can update this via my AOL mobile communicator. Rad.
GODDAMMIT I hate the airlines (except for Southwest).
I know that they are in financial trouble, and I know we taxpayers gave them
a bunch of money to bail them out, so why the FUCK do they insist on continually
trying to screw us?

Example:
  I bought a ticket on United from Phoenix to Denver to San Diego, it was $480.
  I go to try to change it to be round trip from Phoenix to Denver and back.
  They tell me it will be $580 for the new ticket -- ON TOP OF THE $480 I ALREADY PAID.
  And if I go look online, I can get a new round trip for.. $520. Or I can get a one way
  on Frontier for $265. Either way, United gets this enormous windfall of me not flying
  on my return flight. Damn them. I think I'll just fly back to San Diego, then give 
  Southwest my money and fly to Phoenix from there.

  Why can't they just be reasonable? It's such a load of crap.

If it wasn't for the fact that Southwest doesn't fly to Denver, I'd fly them in a 
heartbeat. They are nice people, they don't fuck with you, and wow they're even
profitable. I highly recommend 'em. I seriously want to boycott the other airlines.
They suck. Bad. 

Anyway.
