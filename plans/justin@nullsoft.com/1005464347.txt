11/10/01
been using OS X 10.1 a lot the last two days.
got winampmac limping natively on it. I don't know why
they call it carbonizing, it really should be carbonating.
(Winamp:mac is now carbonated. rad).
If anybody with OS X 10.0 or 10.1 wants to test, let me know.
It sucks though.

I wish tom would hurry up and finish my remote .plan updater
script. That'll be sweet (I'll be able to update this .plan 
from my aol mobile communicator. good times..)
