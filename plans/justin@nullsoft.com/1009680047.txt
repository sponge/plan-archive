Just had a wonderful day short skiing at Copper Mountain.

My 6 hours of airline-induced hell is over. At least I'm alive.

Al and I are waiting for our flight in the Phoenix airport.
It amazes me how bad United Airlines (and most of the
other airlines for that matter) are, and how much we
put up with them. Not only are they horrible about being
on time, they have long lines as a result of insufficient
staffing, variable fares that at best are reasonable, but
at worst end up fucking you
over, and lousy security...
But in the end, we taxpayers give them $11B, and nothing
changes. We get no apologies for it either.
No "we're trying to improve", nothing. What the fuck??

I understand it can be difficult to run a business.
I just think United and other airlines need to try harder, and let us know that they are trying.

A good first step: ditch the highly unpredictable highly variable pricing. 
Make it clear. Don't make it insanely expensive to switch flights etc. Make it REASONABLE.
Holy goddamned shit. Another delay. Such a load of crap.

The day after christmas, in Shittsdale, err, I mean Scottsdale. 

Heh. 
Had weird dreams last night.

About to sit down for a christmas eve dinner with my parents and Allison. Mmm turkey.

12/22/01 21:06
Just saw Ocean's Eleven. Decent movie. I think I like the iBook
more than the powerbook, aside from the G3 and smaller screen.
Anyway.

Test update from cellular phone in sedona. 
Wow seems to work. Going to eat tasty Thai food here, then to see
Ocean's Eleven. Last night we got to Phoenix late and ate at Mimi's
Cafe. Right near where I used to live. I actually tried to do an 
update via my AOLMC at the time, but somehow it didn't get sent. 
Hmm, it'll probably arrive sometime later, heh.

12/21/01 15:01
All is well. Driving to Sedona to visit my family for Christmas.

12/20/01 22:14
Al and I just finished a bottle of Taittinger Comtes de Champagne. Mmm, tipsy.

12/20/01 15:39
Sitting on a bench in Solano Beach. Soon I will likely live (most of the time) near here. Yay.

Funny things happen to your mind after driving 450 miles. Sometimes the least rational things make the most sense.
If you think about it, and any rational solution to a complex problem isn't perfect, then the problem
is more complex than you thought.

Anyway, I'm going to try and introduce an arbitrary variable, and see what happens. It makes perfect sense right now.

If all goes as planned, I'll end up with a super crappy and super expensive old stand up piano.

Allison and I just ate dinner at On The Border in Pleasanton. 
Bit of a drive to LA ahead of us. Tough decisions lie ahead.

Woop Tom and I made it so I can update this via my AOL mobile communicator. Rad.
GODDAMMIT I hate the airlines (except for Southwest).
I know that they are in financial trouble, and I know we taxpayers gave them
a bunch of money to bail them out, so why the FUCK do they insist on continually
trying to screw us?

Example:
  I bought a ticket on United from Phoenix to Denver to San Diego, it was $480.
  I go to try to change it to be round trip from Phoenix to Denver and back.
  They tell me it will be $580 for the new ticket -- ON TOP OF THE $480 I ALREADY PAID.
  And if I go look online, I can get a new round trip for.. $520. Or I can get a one way
  on Frontier for $265. Either way, United gets this enormous windfall of me not flying
  on my return flight. Damn them. I think I'll just fly back to San Diego, then give 
  Southwest my money and fly to Phoenix from there.

  Why can't they just be reasonable? It's such a load of crap.

If it wasn't for the fact that Southwest doesn't fly to Denver, I'd fly them in a 
heartbeat. They are nice people, they don't fuck with you, and wow they're even
profitable. I highly recommend 'em. I seriously want to boycott the other airlines.
They suck. Bad. 

Anyway.
