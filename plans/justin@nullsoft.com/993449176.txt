al and I saw coldplay last week at the warfield. my god they were good.
we get to see radiohead this week, too. oh shit I think I'm gonna explode.
fritz's movie is being shot this week. going to help out. should be fun.
anybody have a good version of coldplay's `animals'? I can't wait for their
next CD to come out, and they played it at their concert and it was so
good.

i gotta get to bed. memories of meatballs dance in my head.
