Yay winamp 2.91 will be out today or tomorrow.
Next week francis and I will be integrating winamp3 skin support via
a general purpose plug-in. Francis already has it limping, but we'll
get it solid and give people who want it alphas to play with. Leet.

Christophe has been making the NSV live capture tools solid and able
to keep sync. Yay. We should be putting up a new nsv encoder tool package
this week. It'll include all of our tools, including:
  * nsvenc:   command line NSV encoder for converting from MPEG/AVI/MOV/etc as
              well as live capture sources to NSV. Can output to file or 
              SHOUTcast server.
  * nsvate:   GUI batch encoder for converting from files to NSVs. Ryan's been
              making this for a bit, and it's really quite good.
  * nsvcap:   a gui app for live encoding from capture devices to file or 
              SHOUTcast server. Based on amcap, it provides full control over
              the capture process (and uses less CPU for live shit than nsvenc).
  * nsvscsrc: a command line app for broadcasting NSV files to a SHOUTcast
              server. Useful for running non-live streams.
  * nsvubmux: a utility for mergine .srt/.sub subtitle files into an NSV
  * nsvtag:   an NSV tag editor.
  * nsvdemux: an NSV demuxer utility for analyzing your files.

And of course, Winamp 2.91 supports NSVs a lot better. Yay.

Fun times.
