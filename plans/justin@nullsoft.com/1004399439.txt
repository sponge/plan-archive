Ouch. I'm working on 4 different things at once, and have 2 other things I need to 
be working on too. Good times, just scattered. And I want to see my girl more too.ugh.
Oh well, tomorrow is more of a play day.

Oh, and the fact that some of these things I'm working on involve programs crashign a lot,
using 100% CPU, and so on, while at the same time I have 15 aim windows open. doesn't help.
and this is an athlon 1.4 with 512mb ram and win2k. i thought it should handle it?
