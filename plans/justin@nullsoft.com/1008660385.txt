Woop Tom and I made it so I can update this via my AOL mobile communicator. Rad.
GODDAMMIT I hate the airlines (except for Southwest).
I know that they are in financial trouble, and I know we taxpayers gave them
a bunch of money to bail them out, so why the FUCK do they insist on continually
trying to screw us?

Example:
  I bought a ticket on United from Phoenix to Denver to San Diego, it was $480.
  I go to try to change it to be round trip from Phoenix to Denver and back.
  They tell me it will be $580 for the new ticket -- ON TOP OF THE $480 I ALREADY PAID.
  And if I go look online, I can get a new round trip for.. $520. Or I can get a one way
  on Frontier for $265. Either way, United gets this enormous windfall of me not flying
  on my return flight. Damn them. I think I'll just fly back to San Diego, then give 
  Southwest my money and fly to Phoenix from there.

  Why can't they just be reasonable? It's such a load of crap.

If it wasn't for the fact that Southwest doesn't fly to Denver, I'd fly them in a 
heartbeat. They are nice people, they don't fuck with you, and wow they're even
profitable. I highly recommend 'em. I seriously want to boycott the other airlines.
They suck. Bad. 

Anyway.
