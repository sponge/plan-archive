Wow, this is really cool.
The wireless is usably fast, I can do AIM (AIMCE 2.0 is good), SSH,
web, and so on. The best part is sitting on the couch, controlling
what the computer hooked up to the stereo plays.

Anyhoo.

Ordered a wireless thing for my old Cassiopeia. My only complaint
about the whole PocketPC thing is that most software for it you
can't install directly to say, a compactflash card. you have to
have the pocketpc device directly connected to the computer. gay.
