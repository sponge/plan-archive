        Get a LIFE/2...

Congratulations to my good friend Dave Riller and the whole crew at Valve Software. You've managed to displace Infocom's Original Zork (you remember...that text-based game?) as my all time favorite PC Gaming experience. All I can say is that though Origin may have come up with the term Ineractive Movie, you defined it. Excellent job, guys!

        read the disclaimer?
