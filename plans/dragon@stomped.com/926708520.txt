Mr. George Lucas today celebrates his 55th birthday. No single person has affected a generation more, giving us all heroes to look up to, and stories that are as immortal as the power of the Force. I look forward to seeing your new works, and wish you the best of success in the future.

Happy birthday, Mr. Lucas...

The Force will be with you...always.
