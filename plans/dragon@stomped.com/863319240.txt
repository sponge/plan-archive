 May 9, 1997:
        Making Maps Just Rules...

 (Note:

 I've had a
        chance over the past few days to get back to my new
        level, SkyBase. I truly love editing maps, and WorldCraft
        makes it a joy to do so. That's not a plug, it's a fact.
 I hope to have
        some screenshots of SkyBase available for people to look
        at in the next few days-- It's a bit different
        architecturally from what is out there right now, and I'm
        hoping that it will catch on well. I'll drop them both
        here, and perhaps on QWcentral, if I can find a place for
        them.
