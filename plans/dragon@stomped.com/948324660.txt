        it all.)Tuesday, December 14, 1999 - mousewheels, micewheels, or meeseswheels (you decide)

Alot of people have been having the same problem I had with binding commands to the logitech mouse wheel in Quake 2 and Quake 3 Arena. Here's what you need to do to get it all fixed up.

1. snag this file from the logitech website: ftp://ftp.logitech.com/pub/TechSupport/MOUSE/Game_Whl.EXE


(While you're at it, get the latest drivers, and install them first).

2. Start Quake2/Quake 3 Arena.

3. Go DIRECTLY to the bindings menu, bind the keys, exit the config menu, and quit the game IMMEDIATELY.

4. Restart Quake2/Quake 3 Arena and play the game.

*** Don't go back to the bindings menu, or you'll have to quit and start the whole process over again from step 2. ***


I hope this helps some of you frustrated players out. The technical explination of what is happening is that the logitech driver has a persistant task called em_exec.exe that prevents Q2/Q3A from addressing the wheel properly. You CAN terminate the em_exec task, but that may cause you other problems when not playing the game(s).
