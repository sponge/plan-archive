The Linux Kingpin dedicated server is now available.

This is considered a BETA release, although it may not be marked as such,
we have only tested it for about 16 hours on a half-dozen servers.

There are currently two packages available.

<a href="http://impact.frag.com/ridah/kp_linux/kingpin-dedicated-pack.tar.gz">Dedicated server PACK</a>. This includes all maps and player models required
to run a dedicated server only. (10.5mb)

<a href="http://impact.frag.com/ridah/kp_linux/kingpin-dedicated-glibc-i386-unknown-linux.tar.gz">Intel386 Linux glibc 2.0.7 binaries</a>. (0.5mb)

Make sure to read the kp_linux_readme.txt for installation and usage notes.

Please report any bugs to me asap. I'm new to Linux development, so be as
informative as possible with any reports.

Server Ops: If you are running Kingpin Bagman (Teamplay) on your server,
I recommend turning off team-damage. Just open up the server.cfg to
see how easy it is to do this. This has a significant effect on gameplay.

Also please notify if you are experiencing server crashes. I've noticed a
few servers going up and down today, if this is due to our code, I'd like to
know.


Players: If you are experiencing pauses or slowdowns in Kingpin multiplay, please
report it to me, along with your system specs, and any possible work-around's
you've found to work (this will help me fix it). I've heard of several people
experiencing frequent pauses and other strange occurances during network play.
I've been told changing the connection speed to modem in the player config menu
solves problems for some, let me know if this is/isn't the case for you also.

The network code has been re-worked from the Quake2 engine, to provide
for better performance on low bandwidth (modem) connections. I also worked the
directional lighting such that the server actually calculates which lights are
touching you, and sends them as index pointers through the network stream. The
traffic created by this is negligible (maybe a few bytes per second) and is
all in the interests of keeping the client frame-rates as high as possible.

So as you can see, I am definately interested in making sure Kingpin multiplay
is everything it can and should be. If you are experiencing problems, I'd like
to hear from you.

First, the response to Kingpin Deathmatch and Teamplay (BagMan) has been great.
However, this has caused a severe shortage of servers, so I have been working
feverishly on the linux dedicated server port, which I'm happy to say is ready
for small-scale testing.

So, the first six server ops running Linux glibc 2.1 to come forward willing to test
out this early build, will be put on my short beta testing list. Hopefully this
first stage of testing will go smoothly and if so, the linux server will be just
a few days away.

Now, another "possible" solution to the long CD loads (again, I can't test these out,
since none of our machines exhibit the problem). This courtesy of <a href="http://www.rcook.com">Randy Cook</a>.

1) Save your current game in the Save Game menu.

2) Exit Kingpin

3) Put the Kingpin CD in the tray, but leave the tray open.

4) Start Kingpin

5) At the main menu, select "Game" then "Load Game". Do not start game yet.

6) Close the CD tray.

7) Select your saved game, and begin playing.

Hopefully this will help things out, but again, I have no idea if this will work.
