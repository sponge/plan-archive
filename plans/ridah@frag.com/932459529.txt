The patch is almost done, just chasing down the "S_Update: overflow"
client disconnects, then we're done. Here's an updated list of
fixes/changes for the curious:

Kingpin v1.1 Fixes/Changes:
---------------------------

+ Fixed long level loads
+ Fixed pauses during multiplay
+ Fixed erratic mouse during multiplay
+ Optimized Vertex Array support
+ Allow access to consol while in multiplayer game
+ Only play intro once
+ Optimized scoreboard, fits more players
+ Fixed invalid model causing a thug model with sewer rat skin during teamplay
+ Fixed gibbing characters in single player mode causes character to dissapear
+ Completely disallowed alt-tab, causes several video drivers to hang the system
+ Added "maxrate" setting for servers
+ Pain skins on buddies in single player
+ Player ID display
+ Disappearing View Weapons on linux servers
+ Reduced network traffic on startup, causing overflowed client drops
+ Holster weapon, select weapon without ammo, can't raise weapon
+ Added "dm_realmode", allows only pistol, shotgun & tommygun, with 4x damage
+ Fixed dial-up connection dialing unnecessarily after selecting Begin Game in Gangbang menu

= Crouching shotgun, won't reload automatically
+ play animation properly after respawn
+ Color coded Player ID (green = friend, red = enemy)
+ Added use of (audible) talk keys during multiplay, accompanied by a random jesture
+ Automatically scale maxfps with rate setting, if cl_maxfps is higher than current setting can handle
+ Prevent safe blockers
+ New seperate text/chat display
+ Easier to hit switch in Bagman

Notice the addition of "dm_realmode". This is something I thought
would be cool, so I threw it in and it turned out to be great
for 1on1 battles. I'll include a demo showing this mode in action
with the patch, so you can see the way it changes the game for
yourself. I think it takes the game back the roots of movie-esque
action sequences, reminds me a lot of the very cool Action Quake
mod for Quake2.

So what the hell is it? Well basically it reduces the game to
the three basic weapons, Pistol, Shotgun and TommyGun. However,
damage is multiplied by 4, and armor is removed. Survive a pistol
shot and consider yourself extremely lucky. Hence the term 
"Real Mode".

Also note the addition of the talk keys during multiplay. In teamplay
mode, you can use them to give orders, or let others know what you're
doing. "Stay here", "Let's go", etc. Or you can just shoot the breeze
while you wait for the enemy to show up.

Also, Kung "I like 'em tough" Fu from PlanetKingpin is working on
a set of VERY cool map addition for Bagman. We tested one of these
at an 11 player lan the other night, much yelling and cussing was
heard. They'll make a great addition, and will scale much better
to games with fewer players, as well as being much easier to find
your way around.

UPDATE: Server ops, the below binaries will not be compatible
with current win32 clients. So best wait until the patch has
been released (which will be simultaneous win32/linux) before
upgrading your binaries.

The patch is undergoing final testing, and should be out soon.

A full Linux client port of Kingpin is now available.

I have not tested this extensively, so please don't treat
this as a full-blown release. If there are major bugs, I'd
like to hear about it. I will try and fix any problems in
what little time I have outside normal work.

I am very much behind the linux cause. Although for many it
can be a love-hate relationship at times, when it does work,
it's a dream to use. I've only been using it now for about a
week, in which time I've developed a strong desire to see
this platform succeed. Thus, I have devoted a lot of effort
towards getting this client working.

At this time, it is limited to Linux glibc, and REQUIRES A
3D ACCELERATOR, which is compatible with Linux (most 3DFX and
TNT/2 cards).

Please sure to read the README file before attempting to contact me.
