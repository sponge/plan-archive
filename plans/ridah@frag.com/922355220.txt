Wow.

I must say I was very enthused by the general reaction
to the demo release. Given that this was only an ALPHA demo
and we really worked hard to get it out and let people
see what we were up to, I was pleasantly surprised to see
it well recepted amongst a pretty wide audience.

I was a little concerned after some "reviews" reported sluggish
performance on 64mb machines. So I loaded up my old machine
and tried the following settings, which seemed to make a huge
difference:

--
Sound Quality: LOW
Sound Compatibility: MAX PERFORMANCE

Texture Quality: One notch back from MAX (Voodoo2, Voodoo1 might try a few more back)

MAKE SURE NO BACKGROUND APPLICATIONS ARE RUNNING !
--

Once you've made these settings, quit the game, and restart it.

While this won't make things perfect, they greatly reduced the
in-game stuttering that occurs as new sounds and pics are loaded.

As for the level load times, these settings will help, but
this isn't something we are turning a blind eye to. You
can expect the final product to have a big improvement in
this area.

Please remember that this is very early code, and we're
very much committed to making sure the final game runs
adequately on a wide range of systems. In many ways, the
"demo" was more of a KPtest than an indication of the final
product.

Finally, THANKS to those that have mailed in their comments.
It's very encouraging to hear of so many people taking such
a liking to the game, and only spurs us on more to make
sure we deliver a title worthy of your praise.
