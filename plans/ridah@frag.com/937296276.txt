The Kingpin SDK is on it's way.

There are several processes that need to be undertaken before it can be released,
most of which are out of my direct control.

Please be patient.

The linux Kingpin v1.20 port can be downloaded from the following location:

http://impact.frag.com/ridah/kptest/kingpin-1.20_glibc-i386-linux2.0.tar.gz

This is an unofficial full client build. I will be putting together a server
only official build soon, which will hopefully find it's way onto the official
Kingpin page.

Why server only? Because the full client needs a lot more work before it could
be considered official. If there are any linux developement houses out there
that would like to continue the work, they can contact me and I'll put you
in touch with the appropriate Interplay representation.

Also worthy of note, is the v1.20 contains a bonus two maps made specifically
for Bagman. I know the Bagman fans have been wanting more maps, now they have
them. You can thank KungFu (Dave Ward) for his efforts putting together the
new maps.
