Request time. I'm trying to backup some of my DVD's onto VHS tape for a friend, but
I'm having problems with the screen going really dark, then really bright when
recording.

My question: is there a simple way of bypassing what I assume is the copy protection?

Please email me at ridah@frag.com if you have any information.

By the way, in my last update I meant to say "the last solar eclipse for Australia".. I seem
to be not alone in my admiration of this wonderful spectacle.

It is a strange thing, when on a day with clear blue skies, everything goes eerily dark.

We were lucky enough to witness the last solar eclipse of the millenium today, and I
tell you it was pretty spectacular when viewed through a welding mask. If you ever
get the chance in the future, I would strongly advise you try to have access to such
a device. A pin-hole projection just isn't the same...
