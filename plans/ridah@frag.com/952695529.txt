Steve Lynch over at Hypothermia begged and begged until
he could beg no more, so I threw some stuff over to shut
him up (just kidding Steve, can you release a hostage now?).

The prize:

One authentic Kingpin cigar (slightly used, but never smoked).
One Voodoo3-2000.

The challenge:

Shoot a virtual cigar from a virtual thug in Kingpin.

You must not lose any health, and the victim must survive
the ordeal.

You must use the friendly guy outside the Pawn-O-Matic
in the first level. Take a screenshot (F12) to show that he no
longer has the cigar in his mouth.
