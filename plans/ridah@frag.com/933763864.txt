I'm running a Kingpin server now on a DSL line in Los Angeles, which I am able to use to get
more useful information than previously. This means the more it gets used, the more chances
of it crashing or debugging a client that gets overflowed, etc. This also means the patch gets
done much faster.

So please feel free to drop in and give it a good spanking.
