The linux Kingpin v1.20 port can be downloaded from the following location:

http://impact.frag.com/ridah/kptest/kingpin-1.20_glibc-i386-linux2.0.tar.gz

This is an unofficial full client build. I will be putting together a server
only official build soon, which will hopefully find it's way onto the official
Kingpin page.

Why server only? Because the full client needs a lot more work before it could
be considered official. If there are any linux developement houses out there
that would like to continue the work, they can contact me and I'll put you
in touch with the appropriate Interplay representation.

Also worthy of note, is the v1.20 contains a bonus two maps made specifically
for Bagman. I know the Bagman fans have been wanting more maps, now they have
them. You can thank KungFu (Dave Ward) for his efforts putting together the
new maps.

Looks like I spoke too soon. It appears even the "big-boys" have caught on now,
with Creative Labs now offering a "Graphics Blaster RIVA TNT2 Value".

THIS IS NOT A TRUE TNT2 CHIP. It is in-fact a "Riva TNT2 Model 64" chip,
which (rather confusingly) is actually a lot slower than a TNT2 chip.

I find this a very deceiving marketting ploy, since nowhere on the official
page (http://www.creative-asia.com/graphics/tnt2-value/) does it say it
uses the Model 64 chip.

Kudo's to 3Dfx for CLEARLY marking their various products according to
their performance levels. I think other companies could probably learn a bit
from them in this department.

A word of warning to any unsuspecting gamers looking at purchasing a bargain
TNT2 card:

If it's very cheap and not a big-brand name (Creative Labs, Diamond, etc),
make sure it isn't a "TNT2 Model 64" configuration. These are starting to flood the
stores over here, and are selling like hot-cakes.

There is one problem: they are MUCH slower than the default TNT2 setup. Even
within the 40%-50% range in some games. This may be plenty for the average
gamer with a low budget. But for those looking for something faster than
their old V2 or TNT, they might find it won't gain them much speed at all.

So if the labelling has anything like "TNT2 M64" or "Model 64" mentioned,
then be aware you are buying an inferior product to a typical TNT2 card.
