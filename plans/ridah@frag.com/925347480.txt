Thanks to Christian Von Donek and Carl Mankinen for their helpful info.
I'm yet to try this, but apparently removing one of the CPU's while installing
the OS, then replacing it once everything is running should do the trick.

Here's hoping..

OK request time again. I'm wondering if anyone has attempted to get
Windows 2000 (beta 3, RC1) running on a Gigabyte Dual P2 system. The
setup program hangs at the blue text screen, after printing:

"Starting Windows 2000"

I've tried removing all cards, even throwing in an old PCI video card.
The only common factor seems to be the motherboard in all configurations
I've tried.

Your input would be appreciated.

Request: I'm looking for a fast Aussie server to do some network
technology testing on. If you think you might be able to help, please
drop me a line: ridah@frag.com

In other news, it has recently been brought to my attention, that my
.plan file dating system is not Y2K compatible. You can rest assured,
I will get to the bottom of this.
