Interesting.. I was snooping around the QR page today, for one reason or another,
and managed to follow a bad link which took me back to the original page I put up
at Geocities (those were the days..). Anyway, I happened to scroll down to the end,
when I spot the counter...

The question is, who is the peron that's been hitting reload 7670 times a day for the
passed 2 years? 

FYI, the page is at http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/8499/main.htm.
