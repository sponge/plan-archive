A word of warning to any unsuspecting gamers looking at purchasing a bargain
TNT2 card:

If it's very cheap and not a big-brand name (Creative Labs, Diamond, etc),
make sure it isn't a "TNT2 Model 64" configuration. These are starting to flood the
stores over here, and are selling like hot-cakes.

There is one problem: they are MUCH slower than the default TNT2 setup. Even
within the 40%-50% range in some games. This may be plenty for the average
gamer with a low budget. But for those looking for something faster than
their old V2 or TNT, they might find it won't gain them much speed at all.

So if the labelling has anything like "TNT2 M64" or "Model 64" mentioned,
then be aware you are buying an inferior product to a typical TNT2 card.
