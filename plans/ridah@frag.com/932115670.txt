A full Linux client port of Kingpin is now available.

I have not tested this extensively, so please don't treat
this as a full-blown release. If there are major bugs, I'd
like to hear about it. I will try and fix any problems in
what little time I have outside normal work.

I am very much behind the linux cause. Although for many it
can be a love-hate relationship at times, when it does work,
it's a dream to use. I've only been using it now for about a
week, in which time I've developed a strong desire to see
this platform succeed. Thus, I have devoted a lot of effort
towards getting this client working.

At this time, it is limited to Linux glibc, and REQUIRES A
3D ACCELERATOR, which is compatible with Linux (most 3DFX and
TNT/2 cards).

Please sure to read the README file before attempting to contact me.
