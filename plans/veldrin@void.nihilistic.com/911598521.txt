http://litestep.abyssal.net/

An awesome site for litestep themes and screenshots.  Actually, a pretty
awesome litestep site in general.
oh, my latest desktop, eat_static inspired:

10.26.98

Litestep b24 is officially released.  You can find it at:

http://floach.pimpin.net/
http://www.litestep.net/
http://www.betanews.com/

This version is a total rewrite from the previous version (b23e).  It's
smaller, faster, more stable, supports transparency in the wharf, and is
all around pretty darn cool.  Online documentation is available at:

9.10.98

Think of it like a commercial... (Like 'Beef: It's whats for dinner.' or 
'Pork: The other white meat.')  Alright, maybe it's not that funny, but I 
liked it.

Allow me to pimp an alternate Win9x/NT shell to anyone who's sick of explorer, 
or just wants to try something new. What is it?  It's an Afterstep style shell 
replacement (Wharf, tiles, plugins, etc..).  Keep in mind that it's still in 
development so not everything is perfect, but there is a dev team constantly 
working on it.  There's a multitude of plugins available for it to, including
load monitors, cdplayers, virtual desktops, mixers, clocks, etc...

You can find more info, and download it it at:

If you're wondering about the beOS style title bars, they're provided by a 
program called "WindowFX", which is part of Stardock's Object Desktop package.

But enough of that...i'm stoked to finally be here at Nihilistic (started about 
2 weeks ago).  Steve and Rob threw a bar-b-que last night at their place which 
was pretty cool.  I met a lot of cool people from the game industry, ate, drank, 
and played with fire (strictly for cooking purposes of course).  A friend 
recently informed me that my Q2 DM level just made #1 on Captain DynaBaul's Multi
Player Quake2 ("...where you rate the levels!"), which is pretty cool.  Check it
out and vote on it or send me feedback or something.
