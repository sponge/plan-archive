Yeah!  Bustin' down Tower of Crime, makin' it as tasty as I can.  It's pretty cool to work in these vastly different styles... one day I'm making ancient castles filled with rats and wizards, and the next I'm creating a grungy gang-ridden beatdown near-future skyscraper.  I've been jumping back into e3m4 to add the last spit and polish before the press demo later this month, too.

In the off-hours, I've been enjoying a little "Ape Escape" on the playstation... very nifty little game!  Catching goofy-ass monkeys is a lot more fun than I thought... cept the camera has a tendency to piss me off from time to time ;)  If you liked Mario64, you'd really dig this game...

k that's it... oh yeah, if Daikatana is late again, you can blame MALEVOLA... he's already admitted responsibility ;) (um, this is, of course, in jest)

I think the fact that I have no idea what to say is a clear indication that I should NOT have a plan file. ;)
