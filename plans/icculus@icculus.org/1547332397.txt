# Whoa, there:



I forgot to mention: I have a Patreon! Mostly I make fun software, tools to

build games, and port games to Linux. If you like those things, please

[throw in a buck][1].



# Arcade1Up mod!



If you missed them, I previous wrote up these other Arcade1Up cabinet mods:



- [Wire up stock volume and power switches to the Raspberry Pi][2]

- [Run stereo speakers into the marquee][3]

- [Trim down a massive rom set to exactly what you want][4]





So after two weeks, I never quite got the stock volume switch exactly where

I wanted it. Sometimes it was too loud, sometimes it was too quiet, and there

was no base level on anything: different cores, different games, and even

different preview videos had different volume levels, so I was constantly

moving the switch back and forth, never really happy with the final volume

level. I adjusted the amp and the values in the monitor program, and it just

wasn't ever _perfect_ for me in all situations. You really need more than

"mute," "normal," and "loud" settings. It would be nice to have really

fine-grained control over the volume from moment to moment.



If only there were already an analog dial that controls the audio gain

somewhere in the cabinet...!



What I want to do is replace the stock volume switch in the cabinet outright,

with the volume dial on the amp. While I could probably mount the entire

amp's faceplate in the top of the control panel, that's a little ugly and

unnecessary. It would definitely be easier, though! Because bad news: this mod

doesn't just need soldering, it needs _de_soldering, too. This isn't

ninja-level hard, but if you've never done this before, you should

definitely practice first, watch a few YouTube videos about it, and expect to

maybe destroy your amp by accident. 17 bucks plus shipping is the cost of a

really good education in electrical engineering, though!



I have soldered things a few times before, but I am _not_ a good solderer. So

don't look to me for great advice about this, but I'll try to stumble you

through this while experts cringe in the background.



First things first: if you had my arcade1up-volume-gpio program from a

previous post running at startup, you should remove it from /etc/rc.local

first and reboot, so it doesn't try to change the system volume anymore. Then

adjust the system volume in EmulationStation's settings to 100%, so it isn't

reducing the gain unnecessarily, and quit out so this setting definitely gets

saved somewhere. Shutdown the Pi and unplug everything from their power

outlets. If you had the volume switch wired to GPIO pins on the Pi, unplug

those, too.



I'm working with the exact amp that ETAPrime had in [his video][5]:

Which I bought from [Atomic Market on Amazon][6]. YMMV if you have a different

amp, but the basic idea is always the same here.



Let's get right down to the butchery. Take the four tiny screws out of the

corners of the amp's front panel, the three screws out of the bottom, and

the three screws out of the middle of the back panel. You can leave the back

panel's corner screws in for now. Once all those screws are out, you can slide

the guts of the amp out of the front:



<img alt="the amp's guts"

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6334.jpeg" />



That was the easy part.



Looking at this board, you can see a round gold thingey right behind the big

middle dial. That's the thing that adjusts the gain: your volume control. We

need to get this off the board.



Pull the plastic cap of the knob off. It should come off without a fight,

leaving a metal screw looking thing underneath. That screw has a nut on it

under that plastic, which you can twist with a pair of pliers, if not your

fingers. It won't give you a fight either. Once that's off, you can pull the

clear plastic casing off. Don't lose the nut or the washers, since you'll be

reassembling this later. Now comes the hard part.



If you flip this board over, you can see six dots of solder that live right

under the round gold thingey on the other side:



<img alt="the six dots of solder"

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6335.jpeg" />



That's what's holding the entire mechanism to the board. The volume control

has six metal pins, being held in place by the globs of solder.



[There are lots of ways to desolder][7], but here's what I did. With the

plastic bits of the knob removed, I could use the metal screw part as a lever.

I applied gentle pressure to that, pushing it away from the board. As I did,

I started applying the soldering iron to the 3 globs of solder closest to the

edge of the board. As the solder melts, I'd move on to the next one as fast

as I could. After I did all three, I'd start over, trying to keep these all

hot at the same time, always applying pressure, until the pressure I was

applying would make the pins start to slide out of the board. It took a few

times, the pins sliding a little more each time until they all popped out

together. It was sort of exciting; you could feel the whole thing move as you

make a little progress each time. Once those pins were out, I stuck a

screwdriver under the round gold thingey, and rested the other end of it on

the round gold thingey of the bass control, so I could use it as a lever to

apply pressure to the back pins. *WATCH OUT* for that capacitor right next

to the pins, as it looks easy to pop that off by accident! I desoldered the

back pins the same way, until the whole mechanism came off:



<img alt="the liberated mechanism"

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6336.jpeg" />



Now we're committed!



This is what my desoldered board looked like:



<img alt="the desoldered board, bottom view"

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6337.jpeg" />



I post this so you can see that I scratched and burned the shit out of this

thing. I told you I'm not good at this! But: it still works. If you feel like

you fucked up, keep going, because it might be okay. If nothing else, you're

getting practice before you get a cheap replacement unit.



The top side looks cleaner than you might expect:



<img alt="the desoldered board, top view"

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6339.jpeg" />



Just a few scratches from my prying screwdriver, but nothing serious.



Now we're going to put some wire in here. I didn't have any left over from

previous projects, so I scavenged from elsewhere: the amp is going to move

higher up in the cabinet, so I stole large lengths from the speakers I put in

the marquee, and obviously I don't need the old volume switch's wires anymore,

so they got recycled here too. Ideally you just have a fresh spool of unused

wire so you aren't splicing runs together like I was, though! I originally had

[a spool of 25 feet from Adafruit][8], and at this moment wished I had two.



So I don't know what each of those six pins on the volume control do--it's

possible four of them are useless, but they all appear to have circuitry

running to them on the board, so we'll hook them all up. All we need to know

about this is that some amount of current was maybe running through these pins

directly from the board, and if that same current happens to be running

through these pins from the board over a length of wire, then fine, it's the

same thing.



So take a bit of wire, strip off the sheath, and put it through the hole in

the top of the board. Heat up the existing solder around it so it holds it in

place. If there's not enough solder there, add some of your own. All you want

to do is make sure that wire is going to stay put. Once it's good and solid,

clip off any extra that's sticking though the board. Make sure your solder

doesn't connect two circuits on the board. In soldering, less is more.



<img alt="resoldered wires, top view"

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6342.jpeg" />



At this point, you can either feed those wires through the hole where the

dial used to be, or take your step bit that you've been using to add button

holes to the cabinet's control panel and make an extra hole in the back of the

amp, which is probably cleaner:



<img alt="extra hole in the amp"

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6343.jpeg" />



(ProTip: after you drill metal with a step bit, gently drill it from the other

side a little, and it'll nicely clean off all those rough metal shavings.)



Now you can reconnect the volume knob. Make sure each wire connects to the

pin that originally went in that wire's hole. For testing purposes, you can

just wrap some wire through the holes at the tops of the pins, but you'll

probably need to solder these on before you're done, to make sure they all

hold tight and don't touch another pin.



Now while this Frankenstein's Monster is dangling loose, go ahead and plug

everything into it and see what happens:



<img alt="the monster dangling"

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6344.jpeg" />



Speakers, power, and the RCA cables; the headphone jack plugged into my phone,

playing "Don't Stop Me Now" by Queen, because at this point with the soldering

iron? [That's why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit!][9]



Turn the dial's screw and see if the volume changes. If it did,

congratulations, you didn't destroy the hardware! You can go ahead and seal up

the amp's case again now and mount it to the inside of the cabinet. I placed

it so it wouldn't be hard to access if for some reason I wanted to mess with

the treble, bass, or power controls, but honestly? My hope is to never touch

this part again. But I totally dig the ominous red glow coming from the box!



<img alt="the red ring of death"

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6347.jpeg" />



Now let's destroy the original volume switch.



Take off the control panel. Underneath is a piece of plastic covering the

power and volume switches. Take out the three screws holding the plastic in

place and it will come right out. The plastic your fingers touch when using

the switches from above will probably fall off. Don't lose the power switch's

plastic, but the volume switch's can go in the trash.



There's a little plastic ring where the switches poke through the control

panel:



<img alt="plastic switch rings"

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6340.jpeg" />



Get under the one on the right (the volume) with a flathead screwdriver, and

pop it out. This also goes into the trash can.



The plastic with the three screws that holds the switches from underneath?

Cut it in half, so the power switch gets to keep two screw holes and the

volume switch area doesn't get any coverage at all:



<img alt="plastic cut in half"

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6348.jpeg" />



The physical volume switch and its associated plastic can go in the trash. You

can reassemble the power switch at this point. Put the plastic cap back on it,

and put two of your three screws back in.



Now take your step bit and _drill out the original hole_. Be careful, because

you don't have much clearance between the Player 2 button and the "-VOL+"

text, and you'll need most of it.



<img alt="clearance space"

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6341.jpeg" />



(As you probably know, drilling this board makes an obscene amount of dust.

In a perfect world, you do this outside with everything stripped off the panel,

or you can just do it on the carpet with everything in place, with your dinner

in a bowl underneath the work like I did because I'm too smart to live.)



Go slowly and keep checking if your amp's volume knob casing fits before you

drill further. Eventually it will...



<img alt="knob casing installed."

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6346.jpeg" />



...and then you can run the actual control into this casing, reassembling with

the washers and nut from the start that you _definitely didn't lose, right?!_



<img alt="reconnected control knob."

     width="50%"

     src="https://icculus.org/~icculus/dotplan/arcade1up/IMG_6350.jpeg" />



Now you are going to want to glue that casing into the hole, because nothing

is holding it in place; we don't have a big plastic nut to tighten on it like

ETAPrime's replacement arcade buttons have.



After that, there's nothing to do but put the knob's cap back on and plug

everything back in to make sure it still works.



Now you have a fine-grained volume control, conveniently placed, and no dead

and abandoned switches on the control panel. And, you probably feel like a

total boss for having completed this mod!
