Irritatingly, MySQL 8 reserves (but does not use) the keyword "groups,"

so if you happened to have something like this:



    SELECT name FROM groups where user=5;



Then as soon as you upgraded to MySQL 8, your query would be a syntax error.



This will work, though:



    SELECT name FROM `groups` where user=5;



Naturally, Bugzilla has a table named "groups", so this broke.



Ubuntu started shipping MySQL 8 in 2019, and there was never a Bugzilla

5.0.7 release to fix this (the unreleased 5.2 branch supposedly has this

fixed, but I'm not sure).



If you, like me, just updated your old Ubuntu server and

found--surprise!--that the stable Bugzilla release no longer works, here's

[a patch to 5.0.6 to fix it][1].



I can't say this is correct, complete, or sane, but it got the bug tracker

up and running again here.
