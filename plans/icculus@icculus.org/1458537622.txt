IcculusPlan



I should go through all my old .plan files and rewrite the database entries

to be Markdown instead. Kinda retcon a decade or two of formatting, y'know?

I'm not sure if that's bad form.



Also, I'm not confident I want to spend that time. I already dug through a

bunch of it to add a "summary" field to the database, so the archives are

more meaningful than a list of datetimes, and I have to tell say: reading

things I wrote when I was 23 is *so painful*.



Ever see the play Our Town? You know that part where the dead can visit their

past lives but not interact with them? That scene makes a lot more sense to

me now.
