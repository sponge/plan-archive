Exploding egos in the night


Quick, Say Something (Nice|Mean) :

 Last year for Valentine's Day, we put up Quick, Say Something Nice! [1]
 This year we're all feeling a little darker, so we thought we'd try
 Quick, Say Something Mean. [2]

 For those that prefer their niceness and meanness doled out in small drips,
 you can get them on Twitter once a day, here [3] and here [4].

 Feel free to add some quotes. The would could use some more joy (and/or some
 higher-quality trolling).
