Some people call me Maurice.



Prey:

 Here come new builds.

   - Fixed to allow up to 8 mouse buttons (not counting mousewheel).
   - Fixed installer crash on startup in Polish locale.
   - Fixed installer to import your CD key from existing install (such as
     one you got through Steam).
   - More localization improvements in the installer.

  Upgrading:

    Demo users: just unpack this tarball (1.7 megabytes) over your existing
     install, overwriting files:

    Retail users: use this one (1.6 megabytes):

    I've also updated the full installers, but you don't need them if you
    already installed. You can grab them here [1].

Quick, Say Something (Nice|Mean) :

 Last year for Valentine's Day, we put up Quick, Say Something Nice! [2]
 This year we're all feeling a little darker, so we thought we'd try
 Quick, Say Something Mean. [3]

 For those that prefer their niceness and meanness doled out in small drips,
 you can get them on Twitter once a day, here [4] and here [5].

 Feel free to add some quotes. The would could use some more joy (and/or some
 higher-quality trolling).
