More mapper "humour" courtesy of "If Architects And Construction Workers Were Really Level Designers" -

Interior Decorator: "Are you sure crates are in style these days?" 

Designer: "Oh yes, very much so." 

Interior Decorator: "But do you really think I need this many in every room of the house?"

Sad, but true... Thanks to raYGunn for that one.

Remember, if you're a level designer and have a joke to add to the list, drop Redchurch a line on redchurch@USWest.net

I'll let you get back to trying to decipher that last John Carmack .plan now... ;)
