Plan:
Coven SFX guy and part time mapper Eric "Redchurch" von Rothkirch has put up a page called "If Architects And Construction Workers Were Really Level Designers", revealing what would happen if mappers were designing real buildings...

My personal favourite is this one from Warren Marshall -

Fred: "Hey Bob, when I try to touch this wall, my hand goes right through it."

Bob: "Really? Fuck, I thought I fixed that... OK, let me change the adjoining wall to semi-solid, move this chair 8 units to the north and rebuild ... try it again in an hour."

Um .. Ok, I guess you have to be a mapper to really appreciate some of this stuff. :)

If you're a level designer, professional or amateur, and have a new one to add to the list, drop Redchurch a line on redchurch@USWest.net

We now return you to your regular schedule.
