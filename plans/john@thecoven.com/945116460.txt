Hm, more depressing reading - an article called "The Columbine Tapes" from Time Magazine.

I loved this quote, where one of the other pupils tried to make out the school was really a nice place to be .. unless you're a "reject" of course...

"Evan Todd, the 255-lb. defensive lineman who was wounded in the library, describes the climate this way: "Columbine is a clean, good place except for those rejects," Todd says of Klebold and Harris and their friends. "Most kids didn't want them there. They were into witchcraft. They were into voodoo dolls. Sure, we teased them. But what do you expect with kids who come to school with weird hairdos and horns on their hats? It's not just jocks; the whole school's disgusted with them. They're a bunch of homos, grabbing each other's private parts. If you want to get rid of someone, usually you tease 'em. So the whole school would call them homos, and when they did something sick, we'd tell them, 'You're sick and that's wrong.'""

Ah, I see. So it's a great place. No, really. Unless you're a "homo". Or wear different clothes. Or have a "weird" haircut.

No, really, that's fine. Don't mind me. I'll just be in the corner with all the other rejects.

America - home of the brave, land of the free, and piss off you rejects we don't want your kind here.

Ahem.
