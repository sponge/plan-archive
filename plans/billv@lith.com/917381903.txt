Happy New Year...

Just a quick update here. Been working on the add-on pack for Blood2 lately. Before that, I did a few things for the multiplayer patch and also took some time to visit my folks for the holidays. Next week I'll be moving on to one of Monolith's "super-secret projects" for a while.

Book reccomendation of the moment... Barlowe's Inferno, Wayne D. Barlowe, Morpheus, 1998

What's by my CD player... the latest from Black Tape for a Blue Girl, a tribute album to Dead Can Dance called The Carnival Within, and two from Haujobb... Freeze Frame Reality and Solutions for a Small Planet. All excellent subdued work music.

More later... hope that HTML works...
