Plan:
Uh, no. I'm not dead. I don't wreck my cars or myself.

LATEST QUAKE NEWS:

Just for the record (8/4/95):
* Quake is a total action game, not an RPG.
* The external programming language is a C variant.
* Looking around is now done properly with the mouse; keyboard-only
        is, of course, supported with auto look up/down and, soon,
        auto-aiming (keyboard only). You can set/unset any of these options.
* The new style of mouse movement will set the standard for all future
        action games; it's that amazing.
* All options are totally changeable, while you play the game. You
        want to increase your normal walking speed threshold to the running
        speed threshold, no problem. (This means that you won't have to hold
        down a 'RUN' key, it will always be running! The RUN key can be used
        to slow you down if you want.) This works with any controller used
        with Quake.     Everything can be changed in real time.

Sony PSX DOOM: The very best version of DOOM on the planet. All music and
sound effects have been totally trashed and new ones created. It feels like
you are playing a movie.  This should really be Sony's flagship product. It
should be out when the PSX is released.

SNES DOOM: Will be out September 1st.

Ultra64 DOOM (3?): The character models are completely amazing.

MacUltimate DOOM: We're working on getting it done.

Hexen: Beyond Heretic (H2): So damn cool. The very best game in the
current crop of DOOM-clones.  It slams everything out there; very dark,
very eerie and the audio/visual feedback is totally and completely immersive.
Screen shots to be released soon.

Strife: Screen shots to be released soon.
