THE PLAN:

To get the entire world running NEXTSTEP for development,
get everyone connected on the Internet, and own a Testarossa TR512.

DOS blows. DOS-Extenders create developer HELL. Windows sux.

The next game is going to blow DOOM all to hell.  DOOM totally sucks
in comparison to our next game, QUAKE: The Fight for Justice!  QUAKE
is going to be a bigger step over DOOM than DOOM was over Wolf3D
(ya know -- DOOM = pong). We won't start developing QUAKE until Fall'94,
due to Jaguar DOOM (Comlynxed!), commercial DOOM (COMPUSA, Babbage's, etc.)
and maybe a DOOM level pack.

If you're reading this, your finger felt good in my hole.  Thank you.
