1. Is there something you feel strongly enough to actually put a sticker on your car about?  A sticker with a pre-pubescent boy actually URINATING on soething you don't like?  Or do you just enjoy urination?  I mean, fuck, I've seen stickers on cars with pre-pubescent boys urinating on NOTHING!  NOTHING!  What does this signify?  "Pissing is cool"?  "I love the evacuation functions of young boys"?

2. Why does our wonderful nation get bent out of shape over arbitrary use of the word "fuck", but we can show shredded, bleeding corpses on prime time television?

3. Instead of spending egregious sums of money to make your Honda Civic into a low-riding, super-badass, giant-exhaust pipe chick magnet, why not BUY A BETTER CAR?

4. Why do game companies insist on having their main characters have the same voice?  Metal Gear Solid, Deus Ex, Daikatana...it seems like every male main character in the video game world nowadays has the same grizzled, three packs a day throaty growl.  Well, either that he's a black guy named "Superfly". *snicker*

5. Why do beautiful waitresses always have boyfriends?  :)

6. Which song would you rather listen to:

"Hey, hey, hey
Then I went
Then I went on down that road 

Hey, hey, hey
Then I went down
Then I went on down that road 

I'm pain, I'm hope, I suffer 

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Then I went on
Then I went on down that road"

...OR...

"Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, Modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eyes' disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring"

7. Why do you think you're somehow cooler than the rest of the world because you smoke marijuana?
