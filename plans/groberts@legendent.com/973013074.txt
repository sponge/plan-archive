Holy cow, I haven't updated my plan file in almost two months.  Let me first apologize to all of the Grantoholics here.

I'm rolling my eyes now.

So anyway, we're still working on Unreal 2.  I know everyone wants screenshots, movies, concept art...any little nugget of information.

However, if it's up to us at all (and whether or not this will be the case is up for debate), we're not going to bombard the media with Unreal 2 information and pretty pictures.

And whether or not those "Unreal 2 screenshots" that made the rounds a few weeks ago were Unreal 2 screenshots or not, I can assure you that what we've currently got in the game blows that out of the water.  I'm continually blown away by the level design talent we have here at Legend.  I think it's one of, if not THE best, in the industry.

It's a shame they all suck at Soul Calibur.

So I went to the big Monday night game last night.  Redskins-Titans.  6-2 vs 6-1.

If you have any delusions that most people in this country are complete f'ing idiots, go to a football game sometime.  That'll clear them right up.

First of all, that "Who let the dogs out?" song has GOT TO GO.  They played it after every big defensive play.  There were two older gentlemen behind us at the game, barking along like Pavlov's dog (what incredible irony!) every time that song would ooze out of the massive speakers overhead.  I think I overheard one of them say he was a rabbi during the game.  I also overheard him say that "we need to let the dogs out on this play" at least five times during the game.  Imagine that in Eddie Murphy's white man voice, and you have an idea how funny it was to me.

Since it was a Monday Night game, there was quite a lot of beer consumed around me.  I didn't particularly feel like buying anything, and having to climb all the way back to the top of the stadium (Section 423, Row 26), so I didn't have any.  But tensions were running high for the majority of the game.

Two Titans fans stood up and yelled "Who let the Titans out" after they scored their first touchdown.  This was immediately followed by a very loud, very drunk gentlemen trying to provoke them into a fight from our right.  "Come on, you f**king p***y!  Let's go, fa***t!  It's okay if you're retarded!"

Nothing happened at that time.  But later on in the third quarter, the guy started taunting them again, and it was on.  The two Titans fans (they were about 21, and also were drunk) walked towards the aisle while the drunk Redskins fan proudly proclaimed to the rest of the section, "Don't worry.  We'll take it outside."

Well, they didn't make it outside, because they all started slapping at each other like 12-year-old girls before they got down the stairs.  One of them actually took the other's hat and threw it down a few rows.  How childish is that?  Well, I guess it's not any more childish than fighting in the aisle of a football stadium over which team you prefer.

So beer went everywhere, literally showering a group of about forty people.  Security showed up to break it up, but not before most of the people around me had turned into slavering spectators at a gladiatorial contest.  "Get the f**k out of here!"  "That's right, you f**king retard!"

One guy next to me even had enough beer in him to say "That's a shame, the Redskins guy was being really honorable about it."  I hope that was the beer talking, because I can't imagine how anyone with even a shred of brain-like matter in their head could possibly think that someone who goes on a minute-long profanity-laced tirade (with a ten-year-old boy sitting two seats over from me), deliberately trying to provoke another person into a fistfight in the middle of a football game COULD POSSIBLY BE "honorable" IN ANY CONCEIVABLE WAY!

It's incredible to me how little self-respect and good sense some people have in this world, that they feel the need to assert their masculinity by actually seeking to physically injure other people.

At least we could laugh about it after the game.  "Who threw the drunks out?"

Well, lookee here.  I've written another book.  Look!  Unreal 2 shots!

*runs*
