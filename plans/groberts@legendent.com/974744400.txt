Final Fantasy IX rocks the house, y'all.

I had fairly low expectations going in, what with the "old-school" look and feel.  But good lord, this game is easily the best RPG for the PlayStation, and one of the best I've ever played.  And I'm only halfway through it.

If you're trying to decide whether to buy it or not, don't let anything stop you.  Go do it now.
