Alright, alright!  I know my .plan file was messed up.

Blame Blue's News.  The HTML worked fine on the Legend web site.

Wait, don't look at the Legend web site.

I'm redesigning it, don't worry.  It'll be cool soon.

We're all working on Unreal 2.

E3 was fun, although I think I broke something in my foot.  I think it happened during the gigantic brawl involving me, Lara Croft, Homer Simpson, the Julie Strain midget, and a twelve-dollar hamburger.

Maybe I'll start putting something cool up here.

Or maybe I'll just fix it when it breaks again.
