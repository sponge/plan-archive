Well, congratulations.  

There are two things that just sicken me about what's happened this morning, and last night.

Well, three things, if you count Bush being the new president.  But there are two more specific items:

1. Nader voters are supposedly trying to "send a message" to the two major parties--that there's no difference between Bush and Gore.  But all they're doing is assuring that one person will win instead of the other--in fact, the person that the majority of them wouldn't have voted for if Nader wasn't running.  Nicely done, "Green Party".  What you've done makes about as much sense as killing abortion doctors.

2. SEVENTEEN PERCENT of people across the country said that they voted for Bush because they harbor some kind of anti-Clinton complex.  This implies that they harbor some kind of resentment against the entire Democratic party because of the actions of one man.  Whether you despise Clinton or look the other way in light of his accomplishments as President IS F**KING IRRELEVANT.  You see, HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS ELECTION.

The great Bill Hicks once said, "Here's the political process in this country.  'I think the puppet on the left shares my beliefs!'  'I think the puppet on the right is more to my liking!'  'Heyyy, there's one guy holding both puppets!'"

A lot of people around the office have made it known that they just don't care about who's the President.  And maybe they're right.  The wonderful economy and domestic bliss that we currently enjoy can't be quantitatively ascribed to Clinton's two terms, just as the skyrocketing federal deficit can't be solely pinned on the Reagan/Bush nightmare.

And maybe, just maybe, it's better to revel in apathy, when the alternative is abject lunacy that contributes to the further poisoning of the political process.
