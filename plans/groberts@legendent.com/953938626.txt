        When I used to work for Next Generation (which has gone

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"
        face="OCR A Extended,arial">The interview, or rather, the
        material that the interview garnered, never made it into
        Next Generation. I left the magazine before the big RPG
        issue began. But the two hours I spent interviewing
        Richard Garriott is one of my proudest moments. I'm sure
        he's already forgotten about who the hell I was. Hell, he
        probably forgot a few hours after I left. But I doubt I'll
        be forgetting the trip to Austin any time soon.</font></p>

        (I was there to write a preview for Wing Commander
        Prophecy, which started out as five pages but ended up
        being one, since Origin wouldn't give us any screen shots.)
        The game was so impressive, and so grand, that I couldn't
        do anything besides say &quot;Oh, wow.&quot; Now, almost
        three years later, the thing is finally in my hands. And
        right before a five-day weekend. Life is good.</font></p>

        what's going on with the message boards, and tracking
        bugs that I see. But mostly, today, I remember what
        Garriott was like that day back in 1997, and hope that I
        can be in his chair down the road.</font></p>
