It's been a long time since I've updated this thing.
I just wanted to give you guys 2 things I/we've had laying around for a while.

If some of you web-sites could put up mirrors.. that would be cool..

First off, a new pro- map.    pro-q3tourney7.

It was a map I found in our old Quake3 archives, but was cut for one reason or another.
It had been started it long ago, but never finished it.. So I thought I'd give it a shot.
I believe it was being made as an homage to the Edge from Q2.. So it does have a
few similarities to that masterpiece which was q2dm1...

I loved the layout, and it seemed like it would play really well with some item tweaks,
and a few map adjustments..   Please excuse my non level designing skills, as it's not
the prettiest map. ;|

Oh, btw, Thanks to all the players who helped me figure out the "funnest" items/weapons.
I tried to get feedback from alot of the top players, as I wanted it to play well.


Here ya go..

Next up, a Team Arena map..  When we do find the time to play some Q3.. We usually still play
our favorite space map..  q3tourney6_ctf, which later became mpq3tourney6, and has now evolved into
mpteam9.    It's a bit larger, with 2 floors on each base, a couple new ways off the base, and we added
a chaingun and a nailgun.  Also a kamikazee, invuln sphere, and the quad alternate out on the middle platform..

It's really fun.. For any of you guys who still have Team Arena, give it a shot..
Maybe we'll get some games going on it at qcon.. =) 
We played ppl at E3 on it .. at Nvidia's booth.. It was fun.

and then got to play us.. =)

ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/misc/abuse_vs_id_quakecon01.zip

Unzip it and place it in your /missionpack/demos directory.
If you don't have a demos directory under missionpack.. Create one...

Such a close game...

Ohhhh..  My first plan update.. =)
Anyways.. I was just going to inform u
guys that I've put up a few stills from
the new IDlogo we did for Team Arena...

Kenneth Scott, Seneca Menard and I were approached to do a new logo for
Team Arena.. 

It started with a brainstorm session..(ideas/sketches)
Seneca then built/textured the models..
I began setting up and animating.. and messing with lighting/fx..
Seneca and I worked on it for about a week and half.. 
It was a fun little project..

I thought I'd post a few different stages.. 
And then a few Hires renders...


http://www.idsoftware.com/home/fredo/Heart1.jpg  is a rough sketch done by Kenneth Scott
http://www.idsoftware.com/home/fredo/Heart2.jpg  is another rough sketch done by Seneca Menard
