and then got to play us.. =)

Unzip it and place it in your /missionpack/demos directory.
If you don't have a demos directory under missionpack.. Create one...

Such a close game...

Ohhhh..  My first plan update.. =)
Anyways.. I was just going to inform u
guys that I've put up a few stills from
the new IDlogo we did for Team Arena...

Kenneth Scott, Seneca Menard and I were approached to do a new logo for
Team Arena.. 

It started with a brainstorm session..(ideas/sketches)
Seneca then built/textured the models..
I began setting up and animating.. and messing with lighting/fx..
Seneca and I worked on it for about a week and half.. 
It was a fun little project..

I thought I'd post a few different stages.. 
And then a few Hires renders...


http://www.idsoftware.com/home/fredo/Heart1.jpg  is a rough sketch done by Kenneth Scott
http://www.idsoftware.com/home/fredo/Heart2.jpg  is another rough sketch done by Seneca Menard
