Hey, happy Valentines day to everyone.  It has been a long time since you have heard from
me by way of my .plan file.  In fact it has been almost 2 years.  

I had to come out of hiding to tell you about the down right fun I have had for the past 
couple days playing Daikatana.  We have been playtesting all of the aspects of the game.  
All of the elements were great fun, we played alot of coop, and laughing our a**es off because of the fun nature of the game. Coop gets a huge thumbs up from me.  Yesterday we also tested the different 
episodes in the deathmatch levels back to back, and it is amazing fun to experience the differences
between them.  The single player is tuning up very rapidly and is fast and furious.  We have
the CTF pretty much nailed down with 4 CTF maps, one from each episode.  There will also be a
Deathtag map included for those of you familiar with "DOOM deathtag".
Lots of goodies to keep you involved for hours.  This game is going to be fun for all of you 
avid gamers, as well as people who just like to spend a few hours killing time.  We have all
been putting many hours of tiring work to get this thing out to you guys as soon as we can, and 
it is getting close.  There have been many people who, over the length of this project have had a great amount of input to the game and everyone's work shows through.

I beleive Daikatana is going to be one of the great games that people will remember and play for a long time.

I hope you all like it as much as I do.
