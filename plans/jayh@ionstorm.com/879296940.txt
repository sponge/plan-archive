Anachronox = Anox




10-11-97

Oh my lord!!!  Have you seen the Daikatana movie on our web site?  If you haven't then check it out NOW.  Since I'm on the Anox team I rarely get to see the stuff they are doing.  Those animations rock!!!  I know you don't get to see very long shots of them but believe me, it's not because they are trying to hide the anims, it's just because us MTV generation folk like fast flashing shots that only show a glimpse of something. (we do?) The compression actually gives it a cool motion blurred look too.  Good job guys.

Our project is looking really great.  We (Lee Doug and myself) are trying to find an acceptable way to skin these characters where we can have a heavy populated room with various characters and not use up all of our map space in doing so.  I would rather have a bustling environment than have a few characters with large skins.  GL tends to blur it all in the end anyways.  Jake got back from Eidos and from what he says, it sounds as if they totally loved it.  I knew they would.

Since everyone else seems to be discussing Star Ship Troopers, I'll put in my $.02   It was everything I expected.  After seeing it for the third time on Sunday, I still couldn't find any flaws in the FX.  However, I did catch a trooper tripping and smashing his/her face while running to the drop ships that were preparing for the invasion.  He/she limped the rest of the way there.
