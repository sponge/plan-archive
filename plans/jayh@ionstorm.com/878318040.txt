Happy Halloween 

I compiled a list of what the "suits" say to us on the elevator

"you guys must be the guys on the 30th floor, you stand out so well"
"you can't tell the Ion Stormers from the delivery boys"
"hey, you must be the guys on the 30th floor making games, how could I tell?"
"hey! did you get a security pass to come in here, your not allowed up here?"

It's pretty amusing.  

I'm still trying to find the Half-Life demo that's out, they had some really nice stuff going on last time I saw what they were doing.  I can't wait to check it out. I think today's the last day to pick it up.  Oh well.  I haven't really checked out the other POV games except for Jedi Knight, and of course that rocks.  I played the Q2 test for about five minutes the other day, it looks pretty cool too.  God, there's alot of games out there this year that I'm gonna have to buy.    

Today is the final day of our little Anox demo deadline to show Eidos.  We just got the new Boots skin in today, it rocks the house, and I'm finishing up a couple of his animations.  Other than that it looks sooooooo good.  I'm sure everyone will be greatly impressed.  I know I am.

Our building just had an Octoberfest celebration downstairs in the main lobby, with all sorts of German type food and beer.  Tom got a really cool picture of himself. hehe
At the event I was talking to Peter Marquardt about the subject that I had seen him last night on Desperado (the movie).  He was the bad guy in the beginning dream sequence who lights the match on some dudes face and shoots what's his face in the hand.  I guess since I knew him I just kind of chuckled.  I don't think it was supposed to have that affect.  Then I'm talking to Jake Hughes who did some work on Starship Troopers, he helped build some of the space models.  He hadn't seen the movie yet, which I got to see last week at a special screening.  All I can say is that movie rocks.  He's lucky to have worked on such a cool special effects type movie.

Speaking of Starship Troopers, after I saw the movie, it kind of reminded me of that show Space: Above and Beyond.  I really miss that show.  It was one of the few shows I really got into.  Fox had to go and cancel it, but yet they'll keep a show like Sliders, sheeeesh (which is now gone too, thank god).  I looked up some recent news on the show and it turns out that the Sci-Fi channel is going to show the first and only season of SAAB starting in January.  WOOOOHOOOO!!!!  

Anox is good and there isn't really any news on my end.  Oh, if you want to join the Anox mailing list type email thingy, just send an email to majordomo@warzone.com, in the message body type subscribe anachronox, and that should be it.  Alot of the team members are on it now including the almighty, Tom Hall :)

This past weekend I got Web TV from my lovely girlfriend Andrea.  You can't download crap, but other than that it's pretty cool.  I'll be using it for the internet until I get my dream computer.  I was surprised at how fast pages came up.  I clicked on an MP3 file and it actually played.
Small text gets really fuzzy on the tv, I couldn't read some stuff on my 53" it was so blurry.  But over all I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't want to spend $2000 dollars on a computer just so they can have e-mail.  BTW you can drop me a line at home, my address is Fross@webtv.com

Another birthday gift I received was wireless Playstation controllers, now I'm the ultimate couch potato, I don't have to sit on the floor anymore to play. 

I checked out some of the levels being built for Anox and they rule, they are completely different than anything I've ever seen.  Awesome, I'm so excited about this game.

Today is my Birthday, I turned 23 today.  Bummer.  Anyways, thanx mom.

I got to see our new office space today, they are coming along quickly.  I seriously got lost in that place.    

We just hired some more people from 7th Level today, mainly the Dominion team.  It's good to be working with old friends again.  Congrats to Brad Doan and Chris Desimone who also worked at 7th Level but now have a job working on CG movies at Rainbow studios in Arizona.  Why is everyone leaving 7th Level?  

I finally got a picture of myself in the latest PC Gamer along with the rest of the Anox team.  Of course you can't make much out of that millimeter wide ink smudge that kinda looks like me.  The Daikatana team got an enormous size picture in there.  Way cool.  Check out http://www.pcgamer.com for a preview of Anox.  There aren't any screenshots, we won't be releasing them for at least a couple of months, I think.  The animation of Boots is going great, I just received the latest animation list for him and it is enormous.  It will definately have to excede way beyond 500 frames of animation.  He also has a trench coat that has to react to every movement, so it has a really organic feel as opposed to a robotic stiff moving character.

Happy Columbus Day, and Canadian Thanksgiving. 

I found my Depeche Mode box sets (1-3) I was desperately looking for.  I now have plenty of musical entertainment to keep my ears occupied while I work.  I met Depeche Mode at Six Flags many years ago.  They were in line at this photo booth place where you get pictures made of you when you walk in the entrance. I was wearing my concert shirt from the night before and I'm staring at them in disbelief and David Gahan (sp?) turns to me and says "What?  Is this a fucking zoo!!???!!"  So I say nice to meet you and mumble asshole as I walk away. 

I'm animating Boots, the main character for Anox, and it is going smoothly.  He was already animated many months ago for testing purposes, but now we have the specifics of his anims, and we are paying special attention to this character.  After all, you'll be seeing him 100 percent of the time in the game.  Lee is skinning him as we speak.  Go Lee!!!

The weather is perfect for a night full of hockey.  I'm about to go grab my stick and play.  Wait, isn't that an add for some kind of game or something?  Hopefully I'll come out alive with minimal injuries.

I've been play Abe's Oddysee for the past couple of weeks and I am in love with this game.  I highly recommend it if I haven't already.  The only problem with this game is that I have encountered many bugs, which is really ODD for a PSX game, but the game is still very playable and wonderful.  I'm looking for wav sounds from the game for my computer (mainly the hello, laugh, fart, whistle etc.) so if anyone knows where I can get them, can you please point me in the right direction?

I heard some music for Anox today, I am really impressed.  It fits the atmosphere 100 percent.  I also got to see one of the levels and was equally impressed.  WOOOOOHOOOOOO!!!!

Today is Kris Taylor's Birthday.  He is one of our sculptor guys who I've know for many years.  His work will be featured on the cover of several game mags featuring Daikatana.  We will have a small bash tonight so hopefully I'll be able to come into work tomorrow, I'll just have to stay away from the good ol Tom Collins :)

Whew boy, what a week.  Last Wed. I came down with this horrible cold, fever and all.  I took a sick day and then we got a 4 day weekend.  It gave me plenty of time to get all better.  During that time I went to go see the Blur concert with Real Big Fish and Smash Mouth.  Blur played like crap, and left the stage early with no encores.  I saw them a couple of years ago and they rocked, I wonder what happened.  I also checked out U-Turn, it is a very strange kinda cool movie. 

I am very impressed with the Jedi Knight demo, of course I love anything Star Wars related.  It has some really large environments that make you feel really small, I love the chase cam.  Cool man, real cool.

Dominion Storm is looking really great, I get more excited about the game every time I see the latest version.  I know that the market is beyond swamped with RTS games this year and there is going to be alot of crap out there, but I honestly believe that if you'll have to pick this one up.  I'm also waiting to see how StarCraft is going be, I'm hoping it will be everything WarCraft was and then some.

Anachronox is coming along smoothly, all is well and I can't wait until everyone can see the coolness that this game is going to be.  Of course we are all going to have to wait for awhile for it's completion :)
