Thanx to all you folks who sent me that Grover clip.  Unfortunately, it's only the last few seconds of the sketch, and I still need the full one.  I doubt there's one on the net.  So the search is gonna be hard.  :(

Hello.  Wow, I haven't updated in a year.  Who the hell reads these things anyway?  Go play outside or get back to work or something. hehe

Alright I need a favor, I'm working on a personal project, hobby, joke, funny, type thing and I need either a sound clip or a video clip of Grover's "Near,Far" thing from Sesame Street.  Remember it?  Grover runs up very close to the camera and yells "NEAR!!" then runs back and yells "FAR!!".   I browsed the video store for some Sesame Street videos and ummm, other than feeling stupid, I couldn't find anything.

So if you have a little brother or sister who has this on tape or for some odd reason you captured the video onto your computer, could you shoot me an email?  I'll give an unopened copy of Deus Ex (my own personal copy that I paid for;) to the person that can help me locate this obscure Grover clip.


Anachronox is going good.  Our team has shrunk a bit and it has a really cool feel to it.  It's easier for everyone to know what's going on when you have a smaller team, and the communication just flows.  Everyone is working harder without the need of a whip and you'd be suprised at how well the morale is for a project that has lasted so long.  If I ever started my own game company (NO WAY IN HELL) I'd rather have a small team.  There's just some sort of cool magic that happens.  

And there's my 2 pennies.


Later
