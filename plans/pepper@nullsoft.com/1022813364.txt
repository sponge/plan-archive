Project: empowering jackasses with broadcastability
Plan:
5.30.02 ===============================

lots of people ask me what the goal is.

the goal is for you to be able to play any song, anywhere you are, in cd
quality, for less per month than the price of a cd.  if you're too cheap to 
pony up, then you can listen to ads instead, but no more than 10m worth for 
every hour you listen.  a light drm in place is fine provided the technology 
exists to stream this anyplace you are.  who wants or needs downloads if 
you can just stream it whenever you want.  disks are so overrated.  if the
tech isn't there do make that happen, then screw the drm and let those that
will pirate pirate and those that will pay pay.  you'll never get them to
behave otherwise anyway.

that's the goal.  first person to make it happen wins everything.

3.25.02 ===============================

EVERYONE MUST PLAY TRADEWARS AGAINST NULLSOFT

telnet 64.167.104.36

3.7.02 ================================

Tom (2:31:18 PM): ponch.
Tom (2:31:19 PM): love me.
Tom (2:31:22 PM): send me mail.
Tom (2:31:24 PM): anything.
Fred (2:31:46 PM): shall i rock you like a hurricane
Fred (2:32:54 PM): why don't they play more stuff by the Scorpions on SHOUTcast
Fred (2:33:01 PM): that's the problem w/ SHOUTcast -
Fred (2:33:09 PM): not enough Scorpions
Fred (2:33:17 PM): it's like all Radiohead - all the time
Fred (2:33:53 PM): The Scorpions are incredibly important - they did that 
                   song "Winds of Change" and gave all the money to Russia
Fred (2:33:58 PM): Radiohead never did that
Fred (2:34:56 PM): They also did "Please Me, Tease Me"
Fred (2:35:08 PM): In the video, the regular guy ends up with a hot chick
Fred (2:35:13 PM): that's really original
Fred (2:35:36 PM): this guy, he's like all regular, and then he's listening 
                   to the Scorpions, and then he's got a hot chick
Fred (2:35:40 PM): very unique

2.13.02 ===============================

happy new year a bit late and all that.

off to des moines for the next week, ol' grandpa pepper is on his
deathbed and i'd rather do a hospital visit and see him out than
know i spent the time working.

work is outstanding.  all of the pieces are finally coming together.
really, 3 years of work here to get this stuff rolling and the
politics solved so we can have a little bit of domination in your
daily lives.  i think y'all will like what we've come up with.

wanna thank everyone for being supportive of the old tomster this
past week.  it's a wild ride at the moment.

12.7.01 ===============================

denny is brilliant:  (for those who don't know me, this sort of
verbage indicates I am about to quote)


11-25-01:
	- Finally get to working on the new danger gallery.
	- You may laugh, but I feel like half a man without my website.
	- Ever seen Mr. Holland's Opus?  That's what I feel like.
	- I just want to do one creative thing, but life gets in the way.
	- BTW, that whole thing where all his old students get 
          together and say "Mr. Holland, WE're your opus!"...
	- ...that was bullshit. I would have gone postal right there.


12.3.01 ===============================

whoa, where have i been?

came to the office for the first time in a month today.  working from
home is much more fun, this place is a ghost town as of late.  way
depressing.

the old a4 turned 40,000 last week, and as promised i traded it in for
a 2002 audi s4 avant.  much more fun driving now.

iowa was iowa for thanksgiving.  binge drinking galore.  why doesn't
anyone give those poor kids something else to do?

the mountain is windy.  things disappearing overnight from gusts.
somehow, the house still stands tall.
