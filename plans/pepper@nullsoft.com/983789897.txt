3.4.01=================================

new sopranos.  i was a little disappointed by the start of the third
season.  they'll do better, i'm sure.

everybody came up today, which was way fun.  denny, jonathan, al, justin,
and bonnie all rode along.  rubber stamps are fun toys.  better off dead
is the best breakup movie ever.  i like having fun with my big pile of
friends.  you all rock.

after two weeks of absorbing 2-3 episodes of the sopranos every night,
i'm looking forward to not having dreams about the mob.

2.28.01================================

  "Cunnulingus and Psychiatry brought us to this."

  "There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."

2.25.01================================

everyone give steve a round of applause.  today he mastered his first php
script (a .plan rotator) and cron, all in an hour.  not bad for a web monkey.
