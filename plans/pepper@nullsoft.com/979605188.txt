Plan:
12.15.01=======================

a haiku for you today

sitting on the couch
with frankel, eating carrots
and watching free porn

12.7.01========================

do you all really like nsync that much?

this industry really is one of the ugliest, ever.

i'm grumpy.

12.3.01========================

what?  a plan update?

lessee.  optimizing shoutcast to crank out tens of thousands of listeners on
a single host with gigabit ethernet, reworking winamp radio pages and 
shoutcast.com site, putting in lots of nifty new metrics to re-do the 
popular listings in a more fair fashion, working on deploying .net free
broadcasting up to 128kbps, new dsp with integrated codec and multiple
broadcasting and me compatibility, unix transcoders, windows port of the
unix transcoder, and oh yeah all that other top secret stuff too.

busy busy busy busy busy.  you all should be broadcasters.  if not, you
can be listeners.  people know more about what you want to listen to
than you do, anyway.

i'll be at mw expo, ready to pick up one of those new apple subnotebooks
steve will no doubt be hurling into the crowd.  catch ya there.
