Plan:
02.20.01=======================

i was listening to KQED's Forum this morning, and they had on Robert Reich,
the former U.S. Secretary of Labor during the Clinton administration.  He
was talking about quality of life as of late here in the states, how the new
economy has pushed people to work harder and enjoy life less. He went on to
talk about the fact that there's a huge segregation in the working class
between people on the fast track and people on the slow track, namely that
those of us on the fast track are assured of not getting laid off, but at
the cost of our own family lives and social lives, and it's really true.

He went on to talk about how the United States may look to start adopting the
European standard, and how Europe is looking to adopt the American standard.

I've been to a couple of places in Europe.  They've got the quality of life
thing figured out over there.  If getting a visa was within possibility, I'd
seriously consider hightailing it over there.  People know how to enjoy
themselves over there.

Maybe it's just 25 year old angst, but lots of friends are going through really
hard spots careerwise right now, and it's really messing up their social lives
and their self-esteem.  There's gotta be a better way.



02.15.01=======================

it's official:  nullsoft is now officially in full on freak out mode.

we've ruined our emotional and personal and love lives lately by working too
much, and boy is it fun trying to sort it all out.  not.

three of us have been to the brink and back in the past week.  send help.



02.05.01=======================

spent the weekend in LA with steve, getting rid of some anxiety.  

we nearly destroyed ourselves.  i'm sure he'll write a lot more about it than
i could.  it's good to have friends like steve.



01.19.01=======================

why did i label all the other .plan updates below as 12/01 instead of 1/01?  do i 
bother changing them to the right date?  of course not.

I HATE ROLLING BLACKOUTS.  i was calmly taking a shower this morning (okay
I woke up at noon) and in the middle of it the power went out.  it sucks when
you live with an electric water pump and the power goes out in the middle of
your shower.

then the power came back on.  things got worse then.

about 4:00 i got to actually start a workday.  i hope pg&e figures the problem
out before too long because spending four hours every day bringing servers back
from death from 45 miles away is not my idea of family entertainment.  i used to
put up with that shit back when winamp was two 300mhz pentium servers in a closet
in des moines, iowa.  i thought we'd moved beyond that.

speaking of family entertainment i'm investing in solar power.  i didn't realize
that a scant $10,000 gets you everything you need to run a nominal 1,500 watts of
power for 20 years.  For those of you who are counting, PG&E would charge about
$41,000 for the same period.  The really great thing is that the state has a law
that utilities have to buy any of your excess power back from you.  Not that
PG&E has any money right now to give to me, but it's the thought that counts.  the
kicker is that you only have to re-invest another 2 grand 20 years down the road
for new batteries, too.  hopefully we'll have that whole cold fusion thing sorted
out long before then.

You should all get solar power.  It rules.  Once it's installed, the Silo becomes
fully autonomous.  Yep, we roll our own water, power and gas.  About time I start
collecting my followers, amassing firearms, and waiting for the mothership to land.

why does it say paper jam when there is no paper jam?  i swear to god, one of these
days i'm going to kick this fucking piece of shit out of the window.

12.15.01=======================

a haiku for you today

sitting on the couch
with frankel, eating carrots
and watching free porn

12.7.01========================

do you all really like nsync that much?

this industry really is one of the ugliest, ever.

i'm grumpy.

12.3.01========================

what?  a plan update?

lessee.  optimizing shoutcast to crank out tens of thousands of listeners on
a single host with gigabit ethernet, reworking winamp radio pages and 
shoutcast.com site, putting in lots of nifty new metrics to re-do the 
popular listings in a more fair fashion, working on deploying .net free
broadcasting up to 128kbps, new dsp with integrated codec and multiple
broadcasting and me compatibility, unix transcoders, windows port of the
unix transcoder, and oh yeah all that other top secret stuff too.

busy busy busy busy busy.  you all should be broadcasters.  if not, you
can be listeners.  people know more about what you want to listen to
than you do, anyway.

i'll be at mw expo, ready to pick up one of those new apple subnotebooks
steve will no doubt be hurling into the crowd.  catch ya there.
