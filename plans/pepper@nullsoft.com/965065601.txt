captainpoopoo (9:54:53 AM): you know, it's hard to rule this much.
captainpoopoo (9:55:08 AM): i mean, it takes a dedicated effort to not 
                            spontaneously deify.
MaxGirth (9:55:45 AM):      Do you sometimes wish everyone could rule so much?
MaxGirth (9:55:53 AM):      like you could just bottle it and give it away?
captainpoopoo (9:55:56 AM): frequently.  nothing sours like mediocrity
MaxGirth (9:55:59 AM):      but no, it doesn't work like that.
captainpoopoo (9:56:22 AM): man we'd be all star trek and shit if everybody 
                            could be as leet as i am

&lt;/bigheadmode&gt;

sweet glorious closure.  peaceful, to boot.  just another thing for me
to be happy about.

the pool is full, at long last.  after arduous months of filling, emptying,
scraping, acidbathing, rust-running, and swearing, the pumps finally started
sucking real live water (and 2 months of algae) from the depths of my murky
lagoon.  by morning, we had something resembling blue in the water.  i'm
ecstatic to get home and see the progress since then.

roof almost done too, ye gods.  cabana may be in full swing by the weekend.
bring deck chairs, beach towels, and umbrellas, if you please.

dave and erin move in this weekend yay yay yay yay yay i like my friends.

fritz is going crazy in iowa but that's because he's in iowa.

mom's here all august to paint and paper and plant.

what will i do with myself come september?

Tag's new relay-transcoder really kicks ass.  relaying, transcoding, and re-
broadcasting 128kbps at 1% CPU is not a trivial task.

Jason's new multi-encoder with integrated codec is also very lovely.  I
really really really really want to release it oh please deal get finished.

Money is dumb, again.
