Made my first stock trade online today.  Addictive stuff.

Um, also fighting crime.  Made new pretty scripts for SHOUTcast, excited to
share them soon.  Quicktime 5 preview's out with SHOUTcast support as well.
That makes the grand total of SHOUTcast listeners out there over like 50
million now.  That's insane.  It also makes SHOUTcast the only audio platform
that streams in RealPlayer *and* Quicktime player, not to mention Winamp.
