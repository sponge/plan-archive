Plan:
4.9.01 ================================

back from new orleans.  happy 21, steve, now pay me the back rent.  oh, wait,
you did already.

new orleans is definitely the place to go if you're between the ages of 13
and 24 and enjoy putting your breasts on public display to drunken frat
boys.  nonetheless it was an amazing time, even if i didn't get to eat any
waffles in the end.  at least taco bell was nearby to act as culinary
salvation.

time for me to get back to work on aremynippleshotornot.com

4.3.01 ================================

    "good god man, jump ship before they finish painting the whole
    fucking thing pink."

                                        -ian c. rogers, june 2000


3.26.01 ===============================

yikes no computer all weekend.  almost forgot how to use emacs there for a
second.

chris and laura's wedding on saturday woo woo!  way to go kids and happiness
for both of you for the rest of your days.

warm weekends with hottubs and ciao bellas and new girlfriends for steve
even though he thinks i'm just blowing hot hair up his bum and that girls
aren't interested.  whatever.  steve's so money and he doesn't even know it.

orphan andy's is good.  mmm breakfast.  think i'll get some now.  oh, yeah,
new sheets too which are bestest.  purple >> white.

3.22.01 ===============================

i did it.  those of you visiting the page from 
http://winamp.com/team/userpage.jhtml?who=Tom today should be able to see as 
much.  purple madness is back.  it was depressing how few people actually 
took notice here at the office.

lunch at molinari's again courtesy of ops.  best damn italian sandwich
in the world.  italians are good.

bonnie's friend jen (that's one letter N only, thank you) was good enough to 
do my hair kick ass style this time.  no fallout or overburn like there was 
over that halloween.  maybe i'll take a new pic of myself for the bio now.  
she totally rocks, if she ever gets her own salon you all should go.  she 
has good stories and scissors in a velvet case with a skull on them.  she's 
also in her twenties, single, and pretty darned attractive, though 
prospective suitors should realize they will need to be rockstars to be 
considered for courtship.

bon took some baby polaroids of me before during and after.  she promised
to throw them up on grrl someplace.  maybe i'll end up in the cute geek
guy gallery someday.  someday...

juman "hong kong commando" tang was inspired and has sworn to go red
tomorrow.  i don't know what that means.

my tivo now records about 5 hours of the simpsons every day.  i may never 
need to leave the house again.

yea, verily friends i tell you, these are good days indeed.  flying tomorrow 
and doctor's appointments and decks to build and more shoutcast records to
break.  we broke our previous peak listener record by over 1,000 today, we were
6 shy of 17,000 peak concurrent today.  Ought to hit 20,000 by May I'd say.

3.19.01 ===============================

man days are flying by here.

just got done pushing some bits of shoutcast into the new site, check out
the radio stuff in the minibrowser and the updated winamp radio pages.
phat phat phat.

gonna go purple again on the hair soon if i can talk bonnie's friend jenn
into doing it right this time so it doesn't all fall out.  maybe i should
tell bonnie about this too, hrm.

spring sprung this weekend, it's so good to be up at the house these days
with the new deck coming along fantastically.  2,000 sqft of synthetic
lumber to screw down, hooboy.  lots of work.  lots of hottubs and 
massages and summer parties to be had.  if you want an invite just drop
me some mail.  this house will be devestating by the end of the month.

free premium television with digital recording capabilities is in line
to be the coolest thing ever.  spongebob and simpsons and sopranos
on demand.  dennis miller cocaine habits exposed.  sweet jesus, yes.

3.13.01 ===============================

first day back in the office in california after a weeklong hiatus
in the land of corn(tm).  wierd/good to be back.  feeling the happiest
i've felt since i can't remember when.  really really great weather, nice
to be around the peeps in the office and i had a fantastic weekend back in
iowa with the old homies and some new friends.  thanks to nato, tom, meghan,
bryce, and beth for being good drinking pals (and more) all weekend long.
thanks to herr Manske for helping with the drive.

came back to find bonnie'd left several acres of toys on my desk, most notable
of which is the Fargo snow globe.  it was full of bright yellow gack so i
attempted to replace it with new water.  too bad it was full of oil before,
because now the snow is all stuck to the outside of the globe.  i was so
motivated by new toy arrivals that i cleaned my desk for the first time in
about a year.

steve got a 10x10 from in and out.  i was so jealous.

sun is soooo good.  after being in iowa for a week in 20 degree nastiness with
ice and snow everywhere and no coat (sorry grandma), driving to work with the
sunroof open and 70 degree weather is pretty spiffy.

finishing up the new shoutcast protocol spec tomorrow so we can start handing
it off to vendors.  also working up some really really cool technology that'll
be hiding out in aol 7, and installing the os x gold master on my powerbook
tonight so i'll whip up a cocoa version of SHOUTcast for all you OS X freaks
that have been waiting way too long.  happy birthday erin!

3.8.01 (#2) ===========================

i wanted to make sure i brought this up later because if i rolled
this into the same .plan update as what's below i figured peoples'
heads would explode.

today i went to long john silver's, which they have none of in
my now native san francisco.  after ordering fried battered salt
i proceeded to the drive thru window where i received the only
meal i've ever been served by a transexual in Iowa.  I was
dumbfounded, his/her ruby red hair accented by black curlies on
his/her neck, the pink nails, the painted lips, the hesitantcy
in the huskiness of the voice.  this was a fast food experience
unlike any other in my life.  i was moved.

i come from one of the most gender agnostic cities in the world.
this guy had no earthly business being in Iowa.  i'm beginning to
suspect conspiracy.

3.8.01=================================

in iowa taking care of mom who was in hospital but is fine and home.
she had some crack in her ears or something.  i call her the human
etch a sketch because the physical therapist basically shook her
head and she's fine now.

there was some talk in the forums poetry about me being the quiet
guy over at Nullsoft.  In the hopes of making you all more aware
of who this mystery Tom dude is, my good friend Bonnie Burton
(www.grrl.com) compiled a list of factoids about me available
to you, the consumer, over the internet.  It follows:

"Tom Pepper, Bravo Wallace, Jack Grubb, Des Finn and various others
lived by themselves in indescribably rundown-looking shacks and got on
with the task of drinking themselves to death in so far as their
pensions made this possible."

So, that's pretty much me I guess.



3.4.01=================================

new sopranos.  i was a little disappointed by the start of the third
season.  they'll do better, i'm sure.

everybody came up today, which was way fun.  denny, jonathan, al, justin,
and bonnie all rode along.  rubber stamps are fun toys.  better off dead
is the best breakup movie ever.  i like having fun with my big pile of
friends.  you all rock.

after two weeks of absorbing 2-3 episodes of the sopranos every night,
i'm looking forward to not having dreams about the mob.

2.25.01================================

everyone give steve a round of applause.  today he mastered his first php
script (a .plan rotator) and cron, all in an hour.  not bad for a web monkey.
