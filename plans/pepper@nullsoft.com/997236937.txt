finished up the cleanup work for a bunch of exploits in sc_serv which
for some reason missed the general populace since its introduction over
2 and a half years ago now.  glad to have those wrapped up.

uh, i spent the whole weekend sealing chunks of wood in polyurethane so
that i have swingy things that sit out on the deck now.  they're fun.

that's about it.  bon's making elvis' fried chicken tonight hooboy!
