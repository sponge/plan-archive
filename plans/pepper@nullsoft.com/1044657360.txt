      can dress like elves and walk around the forest. i will imagine that 
      your hot tub is a boiling cauldron of hell water and we can cast spells 
      on it. sound like fun?

Happy birthday mom.

In virginia, sniper got caught and stuff.  It was pretty punk for awhile
eating ice cream in mall parking lots with amy and giving that guy the
finger.  every second you weren't shot was something to relish.  odd moment
in life.

virginia is nothing but babies and anti-fun once the snipers are gone.
