12.3.01 ===============================

whoa, where have i been?

came to the office for the first time in a month today.  working from
home is much more fun, this place is a ghost town as of late.  way
depressing.

the old a4 turned 40,000 last week, and as promised i traded it in for
a 2002 audi s4 avant.  much more fun driving now.

iowa was iowa for thanksgiving.  binge drinking galore.  why doesn't
anyone give those poor kids something else to do?

the mountain is windy.  things disappearing overnight from gusts.
somehow, the house still stands tall.
