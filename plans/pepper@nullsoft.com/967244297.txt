yeehaw.  another year older.  quarter-century.  sheesh.  thankfully
ian's not here this year for my usual email barrage of birthday porn.

susan is kicking ass on being the new SHOUTcast producer.  site changes,
partnerships, good stuff brewing.

jason is kicking ass on the new SHOUTcast DSP, with integrated codec,
multiple instances, and other love.

tag is kicking ass on integrating the codec into shoutcast.  auto bitrate
selection is not far off.

kyle is kicking ass moving the site onto the new db and middleware.

ops is kicking ass installing boatloads of new hardware.

i'm not kicking ass at all.  i'm just watching the wheels of what is
becoming a well-oiled machine.

well, gee, let's see.

back from ireland.  lots of green things there, one more in little
Zoe.  sure was great to get away from things for a week.  my girl's
the best thing that ever happened to me.  *gush*

back up at the ranch, with new roomies (hi d&e), new disposal went
in today (who knew dave could be so handy?), patio furniture from the
weekend and the first pool party of many to come was a smashing success.

um, lessee, paving the road, finishing up the fraunhofer mp3 encoder
agreement, making new shoutcast stuff work at a new order of magnitude
or two, redesigning site, trying to make my dss work, and, uh,
oh yeah getting really pissed off at rector audi in burlingame for
not fixing my cruise control.  the reason they gave:  "cruise in
off position".  like i'm that stupid.  *sigh*

captainpoopoo (9:54:53 AM): you know, it's hard to rule this much.
captainpoopoo (9:55:08 AM): i mean, it takes a dedicated effort to not 
                            spontaneously deify.
MaxGirth (9:55:45 AM):      Do you sometimes wish everyone could rule so much?
MaxGirth (9:55:53 AM):      like you could just bottle it and give it away?
captainpoopoo (9:55:56 AM): frequently.  nothing sours like mediocrity
MaxGirth (9:55:59 AM):      but no, it doesn't work like that.
captainpoopoo (9:56:22 AM): man we'd be all star trek and shit if everybody 
                            could be as leet as i am

&lt;/bigheadmode&gt;
