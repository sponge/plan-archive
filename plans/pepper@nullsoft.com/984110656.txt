in iowa taking care of mom who was in hospital but is fine and home.
she had some crack in her ears or something.  i call her the human
etch a sketch because the physical therapist basically shook her
head and she's fine now.

there was some talk in the forums poetry about me being the quiet
guy over at Nullsoft.  In the hopes of making you all more aware
of who this mystery Tom dude is, my good friend Bonnie Burton
(www.grrl.com) compiled a list of factoids about me available
to you, the consumer, over the internet.  It follows:

Tom Pepper -- "combination of humourist, romancer, liar." -- um

"Tom Pepper, Bravo Wallace, Jack Grubb, Des Finn and various others
lived by themselves in indescribably rundown-looking shacks and got on
with the task of drinking themselves to death in so far as their
pensions made this possible."

So, that's pretty much me I guess.



3.4.01=================================

new sopranos.  i was a little disappointed by the start of the third
season.  they'll do better, i'm sure.

everybody came up today, which was way fun.  denny, jonathan, al, justin,
and bonnie all rode along.  rubber stamps are fun toys.  better off dead
is the best breakup movie ever.  i like having fun with my big pile of
friends.  you all rock.

after two weeks of absorbing 2-3 episodes of the sopranos every night,
i'm looking forward to not having dreams about the mob.

everyone give steve a round of applause.  today he mastered his first php
