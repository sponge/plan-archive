8.28.01 ===============================

it is not a daily occurence to actually be able to singularly enjoy
the flooding of sensations and memories brought about by inhaling the
combined scent of 20 year old air and polycarbons long ago added to
the fda's most carcinogenic list.  it was, then, no small joy this
evening as i partook in the guilty pleasure of depriving someone else
the opportunity to assemble an original Matchbox Car Wash, a gift
i received from miss burton on saturday, my twenty-sixth birthday.

this is not the matchbox car wash one finds in stores today, Matchbox 
having foregone in the mid 90s the classic blue base, white supports and
piss-yellow plastic water shield on top for a horrifyingly sanitized
white labyrinthe with all the sharp corners removed, doubtless such 
that billy won't slice open suzy's head with a well placed swipe.  
this was the stuff of my childhood dreams, having been originally 
manufactured in 1981 when I was at the ripe age of six.  I can remember 
visiting the new Children's Palace in suburban West Des Moines, Iowa 
a few weeks after my birthday, rampaging across the endless aisles to 
identify and prioritize everything my parents had neglected to furnish 
prior to the upcoming Christmas holiday when i first saw it, lower 
shelf, towards the back of the store by the restrooms, a group of 
mystifying boxes holding untold wonders.  this was long  before the 
days of actually having demo toys for kids to play with before buying, 
when we were forced to wreck our imaginations with what wonders could 
potentially lay inside these cardboard prisons to the point where 
protesting to parents was inevitable.  this, i tried.  every trip for 
perhaps 3 years of my life to any toy store.  every birthday, every 
christmas, paging through the sears christmas catalog (not the middle 
section with the black and white photos of women in their late twenties 
modeling playtex cross your heart, but the latter quarter of the 
magazine dedicated to the somewhat more wholesome pursuit of happiness,
in the form of over 60 full color pages of toys conveniently
indexed, categorized, and assigned letters on every page of A-G.)
The price, $12, was far more than mom was willing to spend on yet
another device for me to pour mud into and spin dry onto the basement
walls.  And so, i proceeded throughout my childhood without the
pleasure overdose i felt i deserved.

everyone has a toy like that, one they never were allowed but
secretly (even in high school, even college, even today) wish had
been with them.  it is the Golden Toy(tm).  songs are written about
the Golden Toy(tm).  relationships start because of the Golden Toy(tm)'s
misread glimmer on hot summer nights.  wars begin over trading
rights and export taxes on Golden Toys(tm).

spinning the spin dry on the assembled car wash was on the top ten
list of things to accomplish in this life to deem myself not a failure.
miss burton, thank you so very much for helping me out with it.

thanks to everyone who shared the past weekend with me, and thanks to
everyone for ignoring jonathan's .plan and not sending me birthday
porn yet again.

when it's my turn to take a drink at the layoff trough, i'm gonna truck
it over to tower car wash and apply.

8.7.01 ================================

finished up the cleanup work for a bunch of exploits in sc_serv which
for some reason missed the general populace since its introduction over
2 and a half years ago now.  glad to have those wrapped up.

uh, i spent the whole weekend sealing chunks of wood in polyurethane so
that i have swingy things that sit out on the deck now.  they're fun.

that's about it.  bon's making elvis' fried chicken tonight hooboy!
