Well, there's nothing more cliche than a .plan that says "We're gold" but 
since the opportunity only comes along every couple years these days, what
the heck.  Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption US release is in duplication
and will show up at your local mall/etailer/warehouse store on June 7 or 8th!

We're busily working on a playable demo and also putting together the "NOD SDK
version 1.0" which will document all the file formats and so on.  We hope to
have a preliminary version of the SDK available by June 7, although some of 
the tools might lag behind a bit to polish them a bit more for public 
consumption.  More detailed info about the demo content and dates will be
forthcoming.

The SDK will include:

Embrace editor (modified from QERadiant)
NOT object template editor
NOD viewer (standalone 3D model & LOD viewer)
Documentation for file formats: NOD, NAD, NAM, NAG, NSC, and many others.
HTML documentation for the CODEX Java API (via JavaDoc)
Source code for all Java classes and game scripts
Introduction to using Embrace and other starting documents

Thanks to everyone who participated in the beta and on our web board during
development!
