E3 post-mortem.

Well, looks like I get to be the first to post some post-E3 impressions.
Here are my personal faves from the show:

First I have to list a few from our own publisher, despite the possible
conflict-of-interest--

Q3 (goes without saying)

Soldier of Fortune - was on the floor publically at the 3DFX booth without
a sign on the monitor (stealth mode!) and looked wicked.

Battlezone2 - Faster, bigger, better-looking, what more do ya want?

Elsewhere:

Messiah - It looked 100% done, ship it!  I want it!

Midtown Madness - Weaving around gridlocked traffic in Chicago in a Plymouth
with a force-feedback steering wheel?  Couldn't stop grinning.  Thanks for
the tip, guys..

Anachronox - Looking forward to this more than FF8.  I want to license that
camera system..

FAKK2 - Drop dead gorgeous.  Same for the engine.

Oh yeah, can't forget: "Human Fish: The Forbidden Pet".  What can I say
about that one?
