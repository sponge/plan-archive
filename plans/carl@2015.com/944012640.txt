Da busy nuts as Ritual managed some time to player WOS CTF a bit, and
they didn't dislike it. In fact, they seemed to rather enjoy it. :)
They've now got a server up and running it at:

debugctf.ritual.com

Go fourth and have fun everyone. That's an order!

We're STILL looking for another programmer, so if you're an
experienced game programmer looking to spend half of your life writting
code with a buncha cool guys, send your resume to vince@2015.com! You
know you want to...

A small note of interest that most should find quite amusing... it
seems some people have actually tried emailing the "address" in the
displaimer PS above... it seems some people just don't get jokes. :P

BTW, I haven't said anything in a while, so... "anything"
Ahh, that's better. :)

Alas, I attempted to get the beta out to the public today, but to no
avail... Yae, the email gods did smite my feeble attempt at emailing
the WOS CTF beta to good souls whom would spread it about for all
the kind hearted, gun toating persons of the world. Fear not though,
gentle brave ones, for I have not yet been broken asunder. Nay, I have
yet to unlease apon the smitefull email gods the true fury of the
weapon which doth wreak of pure, enlightened, Internet goodness. Seek
thee out the gods of FTP, and call ye their might and fury apon those
most smitefull of smiters, so that they might be smitten a non. These
email gods, nay, these email demi-gods, shall wreak of self-pity, when
the wrath of the FTP gods is brought down apon them...

Oh yea... and modems SUCK!!!!

Woh shitchu, I just read the mentioning of WOS CTF and maps on
Ritualistic and decided that I'd better update my .plan clearifying
my... well, my plans on what I'm going to be doing.

So, here's the low down. Please, please don't start sending maps in to
me. Neither me nor my email account could handle it. What I've actually
decided on (after having talked to Eutectik of course) is that I'm
going to get the first public beta out the door this weekend.
No, really, I mean it! All that's not actually taken care of is where
bug reports are going to be directed to. Smack2's helping me out on
this though, so there shouldn't be any worries. Everyone give him a
big group hug of thank-you-ness. :)

Now, about the maps... which are the reason I'm making sure to get the
furst public beta out this weekend. It'll give all the mappers a good
chance to play test their prospective WOS CTF maps with the real deal,
and everyone else will be able to play and get bored of the few maps
that I've converted as testing grounds. After a few weeks, I'll then
have figured out how I'm going to take in map submissions, should
hopefully have enough input for a second beta, and I'll be able to 
start going through the user maps to pick out the ones that rock from
here to high heaven for inclusion in the final release of WOS CTF.

Hope that semi-important seeming rambling made sense to you, if not,
I believe Hexagon is pretty good at translating my typed out mind
melts... then again... I could be mistaken. :p

Mark got the 1.06 source code to me right after releasing the 1.06
patch, and WOS CTF is already proted to it. It didn't really talk all
that long though, since most of the changes were in the exe. Anyway,
I've already got it packed up and sent off for a bit more banging on,
so it shouldn't be long now.

There is one kink in my plan though, I've got some stuff that I'll
probably have to be working on during the comming weekend or two, so
it'll still be a few weeks till public release. But phyched about it
anyway, cause it's almost ready! :)

Thought of the day: Why aren't there massive amounts of people
complaining about those "Got Milk?" adds? How politically correct can
a public service announcement that promotes having large breasts really
be? Not that I've got a problem with promoting such a thing, but often
too much of a good thing can overall be a bad thing, and this is
definatly an area where "just the right amount" is just right. Besides,
where's the "Got Protein?" adds to balance things out?

I got bored today and wanted to code something, but I didn't want to
work on our current main project. Answer: add another feature to
WOS CTF. :)

Fresh on the menu today is "ghost stats restoration". What this allows
is for someone to disconnect (or accidentally get disconnected) and
then be able to reconnect with their score and last lap time restored.
In CTF, your team and selected spawn rune (if the server is running
with them) are also restored, allowing you to quickly get back into the
action if you are inadvertently disconnected during the game.

I was going to stop writting there, then remembered that I didn't end
with anything witty, hip, or cool (pronounced l33t for those who are
into that whole llama thing). But to hell with it, YOU guys never write
anything witty for ME in my plan file, so screw it!

Alright, so I lied about having all major code additions done..
I didn't mean to. I was just sitting around with nothing to do but
wait for the various misc things to be finished by the several
wonderfully generous people I suckered, I mean politely asked, to
do some stuff for me. So, I decided to add "one last feature" that
had been suggested by someone (don't even remember who now) and
seemed like a good idea.

You can now set a "warm up time" for a server, both regular DM and CTF.
You just set the cvar "resettime" to the number of seconds for warm up,
and the server resets the time, scores, and players (making them
respawn) so that people who take longer to reconnect to a server after
a map change don't have to worry about P2 on a T1 equiped players
already having captured their flag before they've even spawned. Another
bonue is that it gives everyone some time to get oriented to the new
map and get on the correct team before the game actually starts. And
don't worry and the runes and flags, they're reset along with
everything else. It's like reloading the map without the load time. ;)

Thought I'd update everyone today since I probably won't be later on
this weekend, and because I've finished everything that you would find
at all interesting to read about. :p

I got an early start on the weekend and have already finished off
adding the final code addition: Spawn Runes. :) Server's can now
specify to have all players spawn with a rune of their choice, making
a kind of super powered CTF, hehe. I thought it was just a silly idea
at first, but then I thought about times when the only five runes are
all on the other team and the runless side's getting totally
slaughtered. We'll see just how well it pans out when everyone gets a
chance to play with it. Everyone could select a rune benifical to
their role on the team and would kinda introduce a toned down version
of having different character classes.

Sorry about rambling on a bit much about it, but I'm just really
psyched right now about how unexpectedly well I got the whole system
working. :D

All that's left is to get one last map WOSified (converted to WOSCTF),
sound effects, a few rune models, and general clean up. After that,
we're clear for take off. ;)

Work on WOS CTF has been getting annoying... been doing alot of the
crappy to do but quite necessary things like making and fixing up
menus and level load screens for highg and low res. The odd thing is
this, I was in the mood to do this stuff when the weekend started. I've
snapped out of it and don't know what had come over, but it doesn't
matter 'cause it's all finished now. *whew* |-)

After I got the afore mentioned done, I started work in the new
tech runes. I've got give two thumbs up to Ritual here, because it's
been so ungodly easy to add in the new runes code! Woho! :) Anyway,
the new runes that you can look forward to loving and/or hating are
as follows:

Fast Grapple - Makes you're grappling hook shoot out and real in much
faster than normal. Also, you don't take falling damage. (found to be
necessary after splatting myself against walls I grappled to several
times while using this rune, hehe)

Vampire - When you damage someone, you get some of the damage you dealt
back as health. It was requested several times when I was taking
suggestions, and it seems to be a nice counterpart to the empathy rune.

Splash Shield - This rune will protect against splash damage, requiring
the use if a bullet weapon to effectively kill the owner of it. It will
still let about 1/10 of the damage through, but that's enough to make
all explosives except the nuke (which still might be survived) pretty
mush pointless.

Ammo Vortex - This rune is best described as regeneration for you ammo.
As long as you have this rune you will continually recieve more ammo
for your current weapon. The speed that you recieve ammo at will depend
on what weapon you're using, so the asault rifle would accumulate ammo
like crazy, while the nuke would only get one ammo every several seconds.
It'll also increase the max amount of ammo you can carry, just as regen
increases your max amount of health.

Small update on the status of Sin CTF. I've just finished two
important additions to the code.

First, the anti-nuke-zones in which a nuke ball can not explode to
full potential, but it would still make a Thrall Ball jealous. These
are going to be placed in the main flag holding bases of each CTF
map to prevent whole-sale nuking of entire flag defense forces.
It'll still take out anyone near it when it blows, but it won't be
able to clear an entire flag room. Sorry nuke lovers, but you know
this is necessary for game balance.

Second, I've added a server cvar called ctf_runeflags which allows
servers to dissable any and/or all runes in CTF games. In my
collection of input on some good ideas for new runes, several stated
that they'd love it if I removed a certain rune, mostly the empathy
rune. I didn't want to totally remove a rune that many actually like,
while ignoring the fact that other still disliked other runes, so I
added this in to let everyone decide for themselves. It'll even
make members of RHA (Rune Haters Annoymous) happy since they can
easily just dissable all the rune.

Before you ask: Yes, I'm working on a Sunday night, I have no life,
and you all can bite me... so there! Or you can just sit there
bewildered at how someone like me could like (let alone survive)
this job while maintaining any semblance of mental or verbal
coherance at all (although some would say that statment has
questionable truth value) and just be thankfull that am and like
doing this stuff. Good night, and this is Geneneral WarT's brain
signing out saying, "WTF is going on here!?!"

Alright, I realize that I haven't updated my .plan in a while, and the
previous state in which I left it apparently frightened many people as
to the future of WOS CTF. Ritualistic and Sin Post have mentioned my
responces to their inquries into this, but I thought I'd let you all
know myself and add in some additional info as well... just because
I can. ;)

The first public beta will be released in just a few more weeks. It's
not really all that long considering how long you've waited already. ;P
I've still gotta clean up the code for the new runes, get the anti-nuke
zones working just right (to prevent reckless nuking of flag rooms), get
some arrangements going for test servers, and get someplace setup for
bugs to be reported to. Whew...

In other news, Mechwarrior 3, Descent 3, and Worms Armageddon (basically
Worms 3) are all out, so get them all or suffer the conciquences!

Also, never get a Squirrel as a house pet, cause it'll make a mess of
the whole place.
