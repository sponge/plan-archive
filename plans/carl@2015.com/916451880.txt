I finally broke down and decided to write a meaninfull .plan update
that some people might actually find interesting. My apologies to
those that prefer the passive entertainment of a flickering television.

I've just about finished the second or our major boss fights. I'm
currently still working our the problem of it being butt ugle hard,
and running our of ammo when you've almost won.

Neither of them will make the Thrall seem easy, but they'll definatly
take alot more moving around and as much skill as you can muster to
defeat them. If you're wondering what it'll be like to fight them, think
back to those 2D platform games that put you in this large arena designed
to make the boss give you as much hell as possible and that went through
multiple stages, getting more difficult as the fight progresses. They've
come together even better than I was expecting. I wish more games put
bosses in areas talored to make them give you hell rather than just
popping them in some big neat looking room. I can assure that any game
I work on, I'll do my damnedest to make them an overly talor,
multi-staged nightmare of a challenging fight. >)

Let's see, what else... Oh yea, something that I've neglected to point out
till now, Total Annihilation rocks! :)

NOTE: I am in no way affiliated with Zied's slanderous orginazation
of anti-Mississippiism. I also have no recolection of his
English Major-like attempts to become the neo-Hitler of the gamming
industry, although I can point out that he has been punished severly for
them.
