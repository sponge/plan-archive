Exasperated Sigh of Tuesday, may. 5, 1999
-----------------------------------------

Welp, I've been trying for over a month now, and neither of the LD's
have even started a CTF map. I have concluded that the LD strike
that I had once joked about is in fact a reality. :\ As such, the only
existing CTF maps are versions of Levelord's CTF maps modified by your
truely. Unless some of you can convince either Benson or Zied otherwise,
there will no other maps, let alone some completely new maps.

Things are further complicated by a total lack of people willing to
test it at all. Not a single WOS CTF game's been played even though
the code's been finished for quite some time.

In escence, unless you guys let the rest of the team know that you
really do in fact want WOS CTF, I'll be wrapping this up as best I
can myself and releasing it in hopes that someone out there will make
a decient map or two for it.

Unless things change, WOS CTF is not a 2015 project, just a
personal project I'll be cleaning up in my off time.

Hehe, sorry, I couldn't resist. ;D

I've got some good news... and then some more good news. ;)

First, WOS 1.04 is all pretty looking now, and it will at a web site
near you in the near future nearly in near enough of a small amount of
time so as to be called near, or even drawing near... that is if I could
draw nearly as well as I'd like, which I can't even nearly hope to do.

In humaniese, this means that I'll be sending out the WOS 1.04 server
patch today when I get finished packing it up and add the pretty
little bow on top.

Second, the source code is ALSO ready to go, so I'll be releasing that later
today as well. Don't be too surprised that the source code is comming out
along with the new game dll, the code was already cleaned up for release as
1.03 source code, but 1.04 came along and made it a worthwile, small delay.

Let's see, what else... oh yea, since there's apparently enough interest for
a tutorial to be made about MOTD functionality, and the basics of a welcome
message system were already in the WOS code (for Marked for Death deathmatch)
I went ahead and added full MOTD ability. You can even make one using all the
neat string formatting stuff used for laying out huds and menus if you want.
It also supports having the welcome message text file in a pak file because
of the file access method I used. Details on its used are in the text file
that accompanies the WOS 1.04 server patch.

One last thing. (Lotsa shit going down today hu?) A big fat woopin'
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my lovely lady, Ann Daenzer! (captain_jane@hotmail.com)
Happy 19th babes! :}

Hehehe, oh gawd she's gunna kill me for doing that. ;)

Three cheers for the Sin Mods and Coding area! :D

I've been plodding along on a few different projects, and I just dawned
on me that I've reached a point that many could find interesting.

I've just reciently finished getting the WOS source code completely
cleaned up and enhanced with the new 1.04 tweaks like weapon latency
reduction. It's just gotta go through final testing to make sure
nothing got fubared during the cleanup and it'll be good for release.

Also on the coding front, I've been working on WOS CTF. The code's
comming along excellently (due to Ritual already having done most of
the hard work;) and some new maps are underway. Unless something
totally screwy happens, or the LDs go on strike, this should take far
less time than Sin CTF took to make.

Doh of Monday, mar. 8, 1999
---------------------------

I forgot to mention something in my last plan update. The evil
development weapons are unsupported features. Please do not call or
email Activision, Ritual, or us about any crashes or other such
nonsence encountered during their use.

Also, no celebrities were harmed in the making of this pack. All voices
are impersonated impersonations of someone impersonating the characters
being impersonated by the voice of an impersonator impersonating the
impersonation of the characters. Or, something like that.

OK, I'm in a nicely evil mood right now, so I thought I'd tell you about
the secret "development" weapons that are in WOS. It first started out as
a special stinger pack to help speed testing of the boss monsters, but it
mutated and kinda grew into something kinda... evil. >)

Hehe, anyway, to get to the point, there are five "evil" versions of some
of our new weapons. They are: EvilStingerPack, EvilPlasmaBow,
EvilFlamethrower, EvilConcussionGun, and EvilIP36. They can all be given
and used just like any other ordinary weapons, but there's also an extra
give command, "give evil", that will give you all these as well as arm
you to the teeth with a few other usefull... development tools. ;)

Now go fourth, and do evil unto those that would seek to thwart thine
destructive Wages of Sin. :)

<=====================================================================>
Da Yakity Shmakity of Saturday, Feb. 27, 1999
---------------------------------------------

I just thought it'd be worth mentioning that if you have Wages of Sin
installed, then you don't need the 1.03 patch. Wages of Sin shipped
with 1.03... because.. well.. it has WOS support. ;p Sorry, I just had
to be a bit of a smart ass, hehe.

BTW, if you want to be able to use a bike in any level you want, try
typing "spawnbike" at the console. Ken seems to enjoy doing that, so
it's gotta be good, hehe. I'll have a few other added cheat commands
later on for you, but be forewarned... they're... evil...

Shmak Talk of Thursday, Jan. 21, 1999
-------------------------------------------

OK, I was tollerant of the slightly falty preview Game Spot had
of "Wages of War", but I can't help but make a public notice to point out
the fact that, contrary to what Game Ceter has stated, we have indeed had
something to do with the development of the "Wages of Sin".

Ugh, stress sucks, and writers with a lack of research skills suck too.
Heck, all Game Center had to do was look at their own last article about
Wages of War to know who made it. :P

Sorry, no witty ending paragraph for this update. You're just going to
have to suffer the agonies of getting your funny haha's from someplace
else. Show's over freaks, bugger off!

...

Didn't I just tell you to leave?

...

Damn it, you guys just don't listen do you. What, you think I'm actually
going to say something important in my current mental state? I don't
think so.

...

Alright already, fine. The final confrontation has been finished and is even
nastier than I had hoped. It's got three drastically different stages to the
fight. Your target's got less health each stage, but it's also more
deviously not nice and is using a different weapon/weapons, hehe. Yea I
coulda been an English major, but I decided to be something cool instead. ;p

...

No really, I'm finished now. :)

Just thought I'd mention that my use of the term "Yakity Shmakity" is
in no way related to 3D Enhanced Mini-Golf. It is, in fact, taken from
Taz's Father in the Tazmania cartoon.

I finally broke down and decided to write a meaninfull .plan update
that some people might actually find interesting. My apologies to
those that prefer the passive entertainment of a flickering television.

I've just about finished the second or our major boss fights. I'm
currently still working our the problem of it being butt ugle hard,
and running our of ammo when you've almost won.

Neither of them will make the Thrall seem easy, but they'll definatly
take alot more moving around and as much skill as you can muster to
defeat them. If you're wondering what it'll be like to fight them, think
back to those 2D platform games that put you in this large arena designed
to make the boss give you as much hell as possible and that went through
multiple stages, getting more difficult as the fight progresses. They've
come together even better than I was expecting. I wish more games put
bosses in areas talored to make them give you hell rather than just
popping them in some big neat looking room. I can assure that any game
I work on, I'll do my damnedest to make them an overly talor,
multi-staged nightmare of a challenging fight. >)

Let's see, what else... Oh yea, something that I've neglected to point out
till now, Total Annihilation rocks! :)

NOTE: I am in no way affiliated with Zied's slanderous orginazation
of anti-Mississippiism. I also have no recolection of his
English Major-like attempts to become the neo-Hitler of the gamming
industry, although I can point out that he has been punished severly for
them.
