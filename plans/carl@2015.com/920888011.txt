OK, I'm in a nicely evil mood right now, so I thought I'd tell you about
the secret "development" weapons that are in WOS. It first started out as
a special stinger pack to help speed testing of the boss monsters, but it
mutated and kinda grew into something kinda... evil. >)

Hehe, anyway, to get to the point, there are five "evil" versions of some
of our new weapons. They are: EvilStingerPack, EvilPlasmaBow,
EvilFlamethrower, EvilConcussionGun, and EvilIP36. They can all be given
and used just like any other ordinary weapons, but there's also an extra
give command, "give evil", that will give you all these as well as arm
you to the teeth with a few other usefull... development tools. ;)

Now go fourth, and do evil unto those that would seek to thwart thine
destructive Wages of Sin. :)

I just thought it'd be worth mentioning that if you have Wages of Sin
installed, then you don't need the 1.03 patch. Wages of Sin shipped
with 1.03... because.. well.. it has WOS support. ;p Sorry, I just had
to be a bit of a smart ass, hehe.

BTW, if you want to be able to use a bike in any level you want, try
typing "spawnbike" at the console. Ken seems to enjoy doing that, so
it's gotta be good, hehe. I'll have a few other added cheat commands
later on for you, but be forewarned... they're... evil...

OK, I was tollerant of the slightly falty preview Game Spot had
of "Wages of War", but I can't help but make a public notice to point out
the fact that, contrary to what Game Ceter has stated, we have indeed had
something to do with the development of the "Wages of Sin".

Ugh, stress sucks, and writers with a lack of research skills suck too.
Heck, all Game Center had to do was look at their own last article about
Wages of War to know who made it. :P

Sorry, no witty ending paragraph for this update. You're just going to
have to suffer the agonies of getting your funny haha's from someplace
else. Show's over freaks, bugger off!

...

Didn't I just tell you to leave?

...

Damn it, you guys just don't listen do you. What, you think I'm actually
going to say something important in my current mental state? I don't
think so.

...

Alright already, fine. The final confrontation has been finished and is even
nastier than I had hoped. It's got three drastically different stages to the
fight. Your target's got less health each stage, but it's also more
deviously not nice and is using a different weapon/weapons, hehe. Yea I
coulda been an English major, but I decided to be something cool instead. ;p

...

No really, I'm finished now. :)

Just thought I'd mention that my use of the term "Yakity Shmakity" is
in no way related to 3D Enhanced Mini-Golf. It is, in fact, taken from
Taz's Father in the Tazmania cartoon.

I finally broke down and decided to write a meaninfull .plan update
that some people might actually find interesting. My apologies to
those that prefer the passive entertainment of a flickering television.

I've just about finished the second or our major boss fights. I'm
currently still working our the problem of it being butt ugle hard,
and running our of ammo when you've almost won.

Neither of them will make the Thrall seem easy, but they'll definatly
take alot more moving around and as much skill as you can muster to
defeat them. If you're wondering what it'll be like to fight them, think
back to those 2D platform games that put you in this large arena designed
to make the boss give you as much hell as possible and that went through
multiple stages, getting more difficult as the fight progresses. They've
come together even better than I was expecting. I wish more games put
bosses in areas talored to make them give you hell rather than just
popping them in some big neat looking room. I can assure that any game
I work on, I'll do my damnedest to make them an overly talor,
multi-staged nightmare of a challenging fight. >)

Let's see, what else... Oh yea, something that I've neglected to point out
till now, Total Annihilation rocks! :)

NOTE: I am in no way affiliated with Zied's slanderous orginazation
of anti-Mississippiism. I also have no recolection of his
English Major-like attempts to become the neo-Hitler of the gamming
industry, although I can point out that he has been punished severly for
them.
