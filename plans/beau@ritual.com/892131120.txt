Artist - 3d Modeler/Texture Guy

  Things have come together nicely on the art side of Sin, and the fine tuning has
begun.  All the screenshots we have released can be considered old news, as we have 
re-done just about every model -- including weapons, as we have made the switch to 
the Q2 code.  We finally have a texture mapping method we are happy with.  The 
lighting model has also changed drastically and things look so much better.  
Visible weapons in deathmatch rocks - there's nothing like the chill that goes 
through you when you see a guy sizing you up from long range with a massive gun.  
Visible weapons isn't as easy as it sounds, you have to account for every weapon type 
in every run, walk, fire, crouchfire, swim, swimfire, etc.  Blade can shoot rifle 
style, big gun style, and pistol style.  It adds up to a lot of animating.
