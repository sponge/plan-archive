The Julie model and new screenshot can be seen at

Also, some new shots on the Gathering site at

I'm pretty happy with the way the model came out. She'll have quite a variety of
outfits throughout the game.
 
Lately I've been finalizing the weapon models and effects.  They are pretty much 
all done thanks to the ease of our effects system.  I cried for full artist control 
over the effects system after Sin and definately got it.  Tearing up a monster 
with a chainsword is pretty cool too.
