On feet sliding:  A cool thing about the Sin animation system
is that the movement for each character is saved off with the
animation.  We actually animate him moving in the world and
his deltas get exported with the animation.  It's really cool
and allows for perfect foot placement in strafes, walks, taking
a step back in pain, etc.  This also keeps thrusts and quick
world movement by a character in the hands of the animator and
the programmers don't have to touch it.
