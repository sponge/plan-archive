I've seen a lot of reviews (positive ones, of course!) of FAKK2, with 
screenshots that obviously have vertex lighting turned ON.  

Vertex lighting will improve performance, but will greatly reduce
the quality of the graphics.  You get no lightmaps on geometry (no shadows), and
you won't get all the sky effects.  

Don't do this unless your system really needs the help.  

Also, it puts me in physical pain to see it.
