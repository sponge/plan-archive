The Sin tools are out.  Check out The Node
http://www.ritualistic.com/node/ to get started.
Send any art related (textures/modeling/animation/skinning) 
questions to me (beau@ritual.com) or Michael (mph@ritual.com)
and we'll try and get you pointed in the right 
direction.  

The MAX exporters are pretty self explanatory.  Your
model needs a .sam (animation file), an .sbm (texture
coordinate info) file and a .tga for the skin.  We
have per-face mapping so you can do the mapping right 
in MAX if you want and then export the .sbm.  Check 
the .def files in the paks for reference on how to 
organize the model files for use in the game.

Here's a sample .def file for the palmtree.
 
SDEF
path models/palmtree
scale 1.0
palmtree_base.tga
palmtree_base.sbm
palmtree_idle.sam

You can spawn any model in the world and check it out
with the following commands (you'll want to bind 
these for easy access):

VIEWSPAWN <filename.def>   (spawns the model)
VIEWNEXT		   (advance a frame in the animation)
VIEWPREV		   (back a frame)
VIEWNEXTANIM		   (move to the next .sam in the .def)
VIEWPREVANIM		   (back an anim)
VIEWNEXTSKIN		   (move to the next .tga in the .def)
VIEWSCALE <scale>	   (float value for model scale)
VIEWSCALEUP 		   (scale model up .1)
VIEWSCALEDOWN		   (scale down .1)

We'll try to get something better than this basic
explanation up in the near future.
