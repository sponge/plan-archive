Lead Artist - Heavy Metal - 

I wanted to take a second to publically thank my friends at Ritual for a great ride.  I will be moving on to Westwood Studios in Las Vegas next week.  Ritual is a fantastic place to work, with some of the most talented people in the industry - hands down.  I've been here almost 4 years now and I don't regret a second of it.  Sin and Heavy Metal were great fun to work on, and I'm extremely proud of the work our little 3-4 man art team pulled together on FAKK2.  We really busted our butts and it paid off.  Watch for some really cool stuff coming from Ritual in the near future.

Thanks also to id software for letting me contribute (ever so slightly) to Team Arena.  Man, that game is fun.  Also to Rogue for letting me hang out and eat their food for a few months during Alice.

I'm very excited to get to work on Renegade.  There is some fantastic stuff going on over there, and I can't wait to get my hands dirty in it.  This game is going to be huge.

Lastly, in this time of thanksgiving I think I'll give thanks to this industry.  It seems to be getting slammed a lot lately.  Yes it's hard work, and yes it's very frustrating at times.  But at the end of the day, you're working on games.  You aren't a member of a 200 man movie studio art team modeling rocks for a two second background shot.  You can actually make a serious contribution to a person's entertainment.  You can't beat that.
