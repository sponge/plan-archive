Don't miss the new Heavy Metal FAKK2 video - it really gives a good feel for the
game's combat and overall look.  Check out the info at:

I'm pretty happy with the way the model came out. She'll have quite a variety of
outfits throughout the game.
 
Lately I've been finalizing the weapon models and effects.  They are pretty much 
all done thanks to the ease of our effects system.  I cried for full artist control 
over the effects system after Sin and definately got it.  Tearing up a monster 
with a chainsword is pretty cool too.
