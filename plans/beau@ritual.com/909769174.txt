Sin is done.
Woah, that was a lot of work.  I think you'll agree
that it was well worth it.  All of us here grew up
on action games and we really wanted to make a game
that WE would love to play.  I think it really shows in 
this product.  The action level is absolutely through the 
roof...you know something is right when you're still having 
a blast playing it after it's done.  
On the art side, we learned a lot during production and
I'm happy with the way things turned out.  Things can
only go up from here.  I'm thinking about writing up
a short tutorial on getting a basic object/character up
and running in the game.  It's incredibly easy.
