Dammit, again been a while since I've updated this thing.  Once I see that Tom Hall has
finally updated his planfile again, I realize that it's been a long time.

A couple of Human Head news bits:  We'd like to welcome two new Human Heads to the RUNE team -- 
Mike Larson and Mick 'VerMoorD' Beard.  

Mike Larson has been in the game industry for several years, contributing sound and music to
many projects (check out http://www.mikelarson.com).  Mike will be tackling the sound and music in RUNE,
and is doing a fantastic job, cranking out kick ass music and some sweet sound effects.  
Get a sample of his music by checking out the recently released RUNE video.

Mick 'VerMoorD' Beard joins us as a level creator for RUNE.  His past projects include the
Unreal Mission Pack:  Return to Na Pali, as well as more recently working on the Star Trek: Deep Space 9
project that utilized the Unreal engine.  Additionally, several of Mick's maps have been featured
on CliffyB's "This Map Owns" web site (http://www.planetunreal.com/cliffyb/).

Other RUNE News:  We are officially in pre-alpha crunch time, which I suppose is both a good thing and a 
bad thing. This part of the project is the most exciting because everything is really coming together as 
various elements are being refined and finalized during our push towards Alpha.  We aren't quite in the 
"no-sleep-haven't-see-my-wife/girlfriend-for-weeks" type of crunch.  I'll let ya know when we get there.

Also, a big thanks to Kazi Wren (Dark Mistress and site admin for Ragnarok, one of the officially sanctioned
RUNE fan sites) for braving the bitter Wisconsin winter and venturing up to visit Human Head.  We took
her out drinking, since there's not much else to do up here in Wisconsin but drink and work.  :)

Oh yeah.  Check out both of the officially sanctioned RUNE fan sites (and download the RUNE video if
you haven't yet done that):
