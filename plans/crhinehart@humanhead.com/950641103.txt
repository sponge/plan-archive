Non-RUNE Related update (but still game related):

Available from the Human Head website:  A FreeWare game called Super Dueling Minivans.
Run out to our site (www.humanhead.com) and download it.

What's remarkable about this game?  It was written back in 1996 by three people (Jason Blochowiak, 
Rowan Atalla, and yours truly).  

It was written in 33 hours.

Back when I was still working at Raven Software, I met up with a few other developers here in Madison,
Jason and Rowan (who worked for a company known as Argo Games).  They had the idea to try and create
a game in 24 hours.  So the three of us got together and attempted to write a complete game FROM 
SCRATCH in only 24 hours.  Well, it took us 33 hours, but we ended up with Dueling Minivans.

Later after some people had tested it, we tweaked it and added a few new weapons to the game, and thus
Super Dueling Minivans was born.  Both versions are available for free download on the Human Head website.

After having worked on several games before SDMV, and knowing the process that a complete game goes 
through (from concept, to R & D, to development, to crunch time) it was very interesting to experience 
the exact same process, only condensed down to 33 hours. 

Go download SDMV, try it out and e-mail me with any feedback or comments (crhinehart@humanhead.com).
I'm interested in seeing if any other developers out there decide to try and crank out a few 24-hour games.
