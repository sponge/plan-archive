RUNE will be shown at GenCon this year, so if you are interested in seeing the
current progress, stop by the g.o.d. area (and while you're there, check out DarkStone
and Age of Wonders, too).

Back from fishin'.

Thanks to everyone who stopped by g.o.d.'s Promised Lot at E3 and looked at RUNE.
If you liked what you saw, wait until ECTS...

Like most developers, we've added continuous Level-of-Detail technology to the meshes in 
our game. Because we're using the Unreal tech, we could have just waited and used the LOD 
built into the latest 224 codebase.  But, due to other Very Cool technologies we're working 
on, we decided to write a whole new mesh system for the game and so developed our own LOD
technology to integrate into the new mesh system.

Interestingly enough, one of the biggest savings with LOD wasn't just rendering fewer polygons.
Since Unreal gouraud shades the mesh objects, a bunch of lighting calculations must be done
on a per-vertex basis.  As a model is decimated, there's obviously fewer vertices that must
be lit, resulting in a noticable savings on mesh lighting.

Developers:  If you aren't yet using a form of continuous LOD, I highly recommend looking 
into it.  The tech behind it isn't all that complex, so developing your own shouldn't take
very long.  But if that isn't possible, there's several companies offering LOD technology
that can be licensed.

Oh...and thanks to Rick Johnson for the finger server...
