Anniversaries all around!

Congrats to Ritual on reaching the 4-year mark, and a 
belated congratulations to Ritual and other fellow g.o.d. developer Third Law
for each recently releasing cool games!

Coincidentally, today is Human Head's 3rd anniversary.  Yup, it was exactly
a year to the day after Ritual was founded that we started Human Head Studios.
Truth be told, the crunch of RUNE caused me to forget that Human Head's anniversary
was approaching until I saw Mark D.'s plan update.  It sounds cliche, but it's hard
to believe that 3 years have passed already.  The future looks good for Human Head, 
as we have two very cool looking games slated for release very soon:  RUNE and 
Blair Witch Volume 2.

I think I'll take a break from RUNE for a bit and go have a celebratory cocktail.
