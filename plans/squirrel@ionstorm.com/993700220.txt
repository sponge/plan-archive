Update regarding Anox & Win2k:

We've managed to coerce the win2k crash
bug to reproduce itself here on my dev box,
which is good.  I have a theoretical fix
in the works, but it'll take a few hours
to finish coding and test it.  After that,
QA will have a go and we'll see if it passes
muster.

If everything goes well the fix should be
in the v1.01 patch, which will be available
friday-ish at:

http://www.anachronox.com/patches.html

We (the coders) are aiming to make Anox
win2k-friendly (though still unofficially
supported, alas) as quickly as possible.

Note that the patch will weigh in at around
5 MB, so downloading it shouldn't cause
anyone undue stress.  The patch also fixes
several minor issues and improves load
times considerably.

Note also that several people have written
me with various workarounds which have
fixed the win2k crash for them.  The ones
most frequently suggested have been:

* install windows 2000 service pack 2
- disable 3d sound / EAX (fixes several games)
- change win2k user logins (non-admin, etc)

In the meantime, have some chips and salsa
and check out the new trailer if you haven't
already.
