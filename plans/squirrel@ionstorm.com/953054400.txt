Wow.  Mission to Mars... is one of the worst movies I've seen.  Ever.
It's fantastically deliciously bad.  So bad, in fact, it's funny.

Bow wow.

But why take my word for it?  Jamie & Michael at slashdot.org sum it
up beautifully:

"...it is realistic and extremely authentic", says director Brian
De Palma (Snake Eyes, Mission Impossible, Raising Cain, Untouchables,
Scarface, etc).  Poppycock.  Not since Waterworld have I seen such
a blatant miscarriage of "science" fiction.  Oink oink, my good man.

In fact, I'd wager that the more computer- and/or physics-savvy you
are, the more you'll enjoy laughing at this terrible terrible piece of
cinematic trash.  Whether or not that laugh is worth $7 is up to you.
