Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who came to see Anachronox
at E3, and for the overwhelmingly positive feedback we've been
getting on the game so far.  Hopefully it was obvious to everyone
how excited we are about the project (I completely lost my voice!).

We'd love to hear people's impressions & suggestions, so please
drop us an email or two and let us know what's great and what
could be, well, better.  ;-)
