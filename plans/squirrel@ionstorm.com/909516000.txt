Apparently there's been a bit of confusion about using Qizmo/ps2rate.exe:

- Works in Win95, works in Win98.
- Doesn't work in WinNT.
- Works with ps/2 (round plug) mice.
- Doesn't work with normal serial (trapezoidal 9-pin) mice.
- Doesn't work with USB mice.
- Doesn't overwrite your current mouse driver.
- It only lasts for the current windows session, so you have to re-run
the program (ps2rate.exe) every time you reboot.
- This WILL affect your windows mouse cursor, AND every game you run out
of windows (unless that game itself does something funky to the mouse).
- The best way to run the program for the first time is probably:

1. Open an MSDOS prompt.
2. Change to the directory where you put ps2rate.exe.
3. Make sure the file "ps2rate.vxd" is there too.
3. Type "ps2rate 200" to set your ps/2 mouse to 200hz.
4. Make sure it says it was successful.  If not, make sure you actually
have a ps/2-style mouse.
5. Still no luck?  Try "ps2rate 100" for 100hz.  Or 80hz, or 60hz.
6. If it worked (and it will tell you if it did), you mouse will be happy.
7. If you want this to run automatically upon windows startup, you can
make a shortcut to the program and put it in Start->Programs->StartUp.
Make sure you include a "200" (no quotes) on the Target line in your
Shortcut Properties, after "ps2rate.exe".

If it doesn't work, crashes your machine, or gives you indigestion,
don't blame me.  I didn't write the thing.  ;-)

And yes, it's faster than a default USB mouse (200hz, compared to 125hz).
But at that point the performance feels pretty much the same anyway,
at least to me.

Oh daddy, oh daddy.

I thought the universe had finally gone from Bad to Good the day that
I got my USB mouse.  I was right.

It just went from Good to Better.

If any of you missed the mention of it on Blue's yesterday, there has
been a revolutionary breakthrough in the world of mouse performance:

Qizmo.

The latest version of Qizmo (a QuakeWorld proxy) has a feature which,
among other things, claims to increase the sampling rate of your ps/2
mouse to values MUCH higher than the normal 40hz.  Would you believe
100hz?  How about 200hz??

It's absolutely true.  And you can feel the difference immediately,
as much as you did with a USB mouse.

We've often remarked how dumb it is that serial mice are so slow under
windoze, and yet their ports have always been capable of much higher data
transfer rates.  Well, somebody finally wrote a program to right this.

Please, if you have a ps/2 mouse, download this and try it for yourself.
You'll thank me in the morning.  (This program is the mouse-only portion
of Qizmo).

Kudos and a half to Juha Kujala  for writing it.

Oh daddy.

Being the world's foremost whiner and complainer about all things rotten
with WinQuake, QuakeWorld, and Quake2's mouse control (and having all but
refused to play these games due to this problem), I have finally seen
the light.

I have, of course, heard about USB mice and how great they are for quite
some time now.  Being the eternal skeptic - and fearing change, as I
often do - I had not bothered to really look into them or to buy one to
try it out.  Until now, that is.

As soon as the box arrived in the mail, I hooked it up and ran my little
mouse sampling-rate test program on it.  Where before mice were showing
40hz and 44hz sample rates (for ps/2 and serial, respectively), my new
USB mouse showed a VERY impressive 125hz.  Yow.

For those of you who read my mini-dissertation-rant on why it's BAD to
have a framerate higher than 40/44hz (and even worse to have a low one),
the USB mouse is indeed the answer to that problem.  Now it's safe to
crank up your SLI Voodoo2s and your refresh rate and your cl_maxfps
and turn off that nasty m_filter.  Your mouse performance will be
fantastic, a complete turnabout from the previous state of the universe.
Fast button-to-fire response (because of no more cl_maxfps), 100% accurate
mouse (because of no more m_filter), and 100% smooth mouse (because of
120hz, which means fresh mouse data on every client-frame).

I know this is probably old news to a lot of people, but I know for a
fact that there are still hordes of Doom/DosQuake loyalists out there
(like me) who haven't yet tasted of USB's sweetness.

Best of all, I can *finally* use WinQuake, and still be able to do the
super-cool mouse trickiness and consistant rocket-jumping, etc.  And
Quake2's railgun just got much cooler.  ;-)
