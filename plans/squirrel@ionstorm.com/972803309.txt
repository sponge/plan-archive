NO, Eidos did NOT cut Anachronox in half.  WE did.  And it was
over a year ago.

The story, as it was originally laid out, was huge.  We brought
on a full-time writer (Richard Gaubert) in January of '99 to
flesh out all of the game's dialogue.  Once Richie got to it,
however, we soon realized that the level of detail he was going
into with each character was much greater than we had anticipated,
and so we had to make a choice between (a) cutting some depth
and (b) cutting the length of the story.

We chose (b).  There was an excellent stopping-point in the story
about halfway through (in which one set of issues gets resolved
but another can of worms is opened), and this point now serves as
the (excellent) conclusion of Anachronox.  The second half of the
story - for which a substantial amount of art and level-work have
already been created - is planned for a seperate release.  (Keep
in mind that even the original Anachronox story was only a portion
of a larger overall story/mythos.)

I assume this is just a case of some uninformed folks picking up
some (very) old news and, true to form, not bothering to check
it out before publishing it.  ;-)

Suffice it to say that we're psyched about Anox, as is Eidos.

sorry to burst your bubble,  ;-)
