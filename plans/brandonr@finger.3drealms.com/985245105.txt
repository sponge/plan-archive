Operation Flashpoint is pretty bad ass.  Stephen Cole (one of our level designers) hex edited his mission files to give himself a chopper.  I watched him kick around in that thing for a while, firing on his C.O. who was trying to get away in an Army jeep.  Cole swung around a bit low to the ground and the chopper started to drift left.  It hit a hill and he either hit the key to dismount or it knocked him out of the door.  He survived the crash, but was sitting on his ass underneath this big black russian chopper with no pilot and a hot engine.  The chopper started to spin around a bit (great physics here) and rock on its axis.  It clearly wanted to get off the ground.

I think Cole was unsure what to do, because the chopper started to swing his direction and let's just say the results were not pretty.  The meat wagon had a hard time finding enough pieces of his head to do a proper I.D. on the corpse.

Later Stephen was blowing up enemy vehicles in the chopper and just as he finished off an enemy tank he clipped a tree.  Boom.  Mr. Cole died on impact.  But what do you expect when a ground pounder commandeers a vehicle he isn't trained to fly? :)

Sweet looking game.  We also played around with shooting out the tires on the jeep before the C.O. gets in (physics on flat tires was cool) and Stephen also kicked around in the tank running down Russians and Americans alike.  Neat stuff.  I hope the game has coop multiplayer.  The simulation detail is really high here.  Very cool game.

I'm playing Fallout Tactics.  In the first mission I was given a sniper named "Farsight."  In my second battle, Farsight took a shot to the head and was permanently blinded.  A blind sniper isn't so useful.

My main character is named "Willard" because he looks just like Alan Willard, a level designer at Epic Games.
