  Argh!  As much as it pains me to say it, I have to echo Keith's comments on Giants.  Last night I played the Mecc mission "The Battle" two or three times.  Each time took about 40 minutes because I couldn't save between missions.
  Each time, I would reach a certain point in the mission the game would dump out to the desktop.  (And earlier when playing this mission, I got really far just to die from a sniper shot...)  I really don't think that forcing players to only save between missions is a design decision that can be forced onto players.  Its extremely frustrating and causes problems for every game that tries to do it.  I really want to like Giants...its really funny and the gameplay is great...but this damn crash bug sucks.
  So I'm playing EverQuest instead.  A long time ago when I was addicted to UO I said that I thought EverQuest sucked.  I did at the time...now I'm getting into it.  Its so much a DikuMUD rip off it pisses me off, but I like playing it anyway.  I've got a level 7 mage on Terris-Thule named Borjoyzee (that's how much I like Giants).  Its interesting...don't know how long I'll keep up with it.  Maybe I'll go get those expansions...not sure yet.
