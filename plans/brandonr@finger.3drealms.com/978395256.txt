Got some excellent books for Christmas.  A signed 1st edition of Robert Jordan's "Winter's Heart."  A signed and numbered 1st edition of a special rerelease of Robert Sawyer's "Golden Fleece" (I wonder if this story was an inspiration for System Shock?)  Also got a 1st edition paperback copy of Robert E. Howard's "The Gods of Bal-Sagoth."  The book from which my favorite band, Bal-Sagoth, acquired its namesake.

My mother got me a copy of Apocalypse Now on DVD, which I had not seen.  Watched it last night...absolutely amazing film.  Now I want to reread Conrad's "Heart of Darkness."

Been listening to a lot of different stuff lately.  Operatic metal from Therion and Nightwish.  Some old Immortal and Satyricon CDs.  Some old Busta Rhymes CDs.

Here is my single prediction for the next millenium:

Humanity will, by the end of the 3rd millenium AD, be subjugated by artificial intelligence of its own creation.

I would argue that the term artificial intelligence is misleading.  I believe there is nothing magical or uniquely spiritual about the human mind.  That our biological machinery can be duplicated with sufficient technology (and sufficient advances in quantum physics, quantum computing, and the study of quantum consciousness).  Therefore, I would amend this slightly and say "Humanity will be subjugated by a superior intelligence of its own creation."

I'll make no qualifications as to the form of the subjugation; whether it is total military domination or subtle political manipulation.  Neither will I place a judgement upon it.  I do not consider such a fate to be inherently immoral or necessarily unacceptable.

Perhaps in a universe to tightly constricted by the speed of light and its implications our only course for extended survival is a shift from a biological base to a mechanical one.
