That should say "no more greater" not "more greater."  I've corrected my typo.

I was listening to "Talk of the Nation" this morning on NPR on my way to work.  I really hate that show, but I listen to it anyway, because I like NPR.  Anyway, a Gore supporter on the show said "there is no more greater a conscience or intellect in America than Al Gore."

Christ...do these people realize how sold they are when they say stuff like this?  Of course, if this guy thinks the majority of Americans are drones who accidentally vote for Buchannon, maybe he's justified in calling Gore the greatest intellect in the country.  I can just see thousands of voters opening the door to their SUVs, stopping suddenly, and slapping their heads.  "Doh!"

As if it matters.  Not much of a difference between Gore and Bush anyway.  Neither speak on issues of real significance.  Its kind of funny watching all these game developers updating their .plans, telling you how much your vote matters and you should really go vote for Bush because Lieberman is such a bad guy.  Or how you should vote for Gore, because the Republicans are worse.

Will anyone raise their hand for voter apathy?

At this point, I have little interest in the outcome of the election.  Greater restrictions on game content seems inevitable and boths sides are capable of working together to enact some form of legislation.  In the end, its not going to affect the creativity of the game industry.  The issue is so petty and irrelevant in the light of things like the decaying global environment or people in Philly getting arrested at half a million bail for peacefully protesting the RNC.

Yeah, it sucks that people are too damn stupid to watch out for their kids.  What else is new?
