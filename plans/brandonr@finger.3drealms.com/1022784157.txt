Danni Filth should do the music for Doom 3!

(Hell, he's probably got the time on his hands.  All CoF has been doing lately is rereleasing old material!)

"The ancient white light writings were just lying men and their pens.  You are the same, only in black.  Return with the knowledge of making your own god."

Doom 3!  Doom 3!  Oh my Doom 3!  I shall worship thee with crimson sacrifice.  The green marine shall hunt and slay once more!
