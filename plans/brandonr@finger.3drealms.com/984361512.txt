Don't read this if you haven't seen the ending of Tenchi Universe.

--

I haven't cried watching anime since "The Wings of Honneamise" (which I thought was a particularly powerful space-epic).  I cried last night when I watched Ryoko die at the end of Tenchi Universe.  Tenchi didn't even give her a kiss when he left her at Jurai.  Stupid bastard.  Man, it still bugs me that she died.  I can't believe it.  What a great anime series.  This has made me utterly otaku.  I'm spending way too much on anime now.

Outlaw Star is great.  I'm trying to get the others at 3DR interested in it so I ordered the DVDs.  I also want to get the Sailor Moon fansubs.  I've also read about other shojo anime series like Maho No Mako-chan and Maho No Princess Minky Momo.  Hopefully I'll be able to find fansubs of some of this stuff.

I can't believe I grew up watching shit like He-Man and GI Joe.
