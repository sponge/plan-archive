Damn, Grant got to his plan file before I did. :)

Final Fantasy 9 absolutely kicks ass and completely restores my faith in console RPGs.  Square has perfected the combat system in this game.  I spent several hours this weekend just running around fighting and building up my abilities.

Unlike FF7 and FF8 (at least so far in the game) battle is focused much more on equipment and normal combat abilities, rather than power battles with summon spells.  The summon spells are heavily mana costed, so you can't even use them until you get high enough level (as far as I can tell, I'm not far enough to use any of them yet and I'm about 8 hours into the game).

The minicard game, Tetra Master, is just as frustrating and annoying as Triple Triad.  20 minutes into the game I got a Cactaur card for jumping rope 55 times and then I immidiately lost it in a card battle.  Sux0r.

Anyway, go pick up FF9.  It kicks Chrono Cross's sorry ass all over the pavement.
