Ah ha!  Baldur's Gate II: Collector's Edition number 40616 of 62000 is MINE!  The last one they had at the Town East Mall Electronics Boutique! HAHAHA!  BITE ME YOU ID SOFTWARE PEOPLE AND RITUAL PEOPLE WHO DO NOT YET OWN THE GAME HAHAHA!  YOU WILL HAVE TO DRIVE TO PLANO OR WAIT SEVERAL DAYS IN AGONY!!! HAHAHA!

And I got Windows ME and Redhat 7.0 is coming out soon!  It will be a mighty weekend of installing software and recovering from OS failures and repartitioning mishaps!

What else?  Crimson Skies is really cool.
