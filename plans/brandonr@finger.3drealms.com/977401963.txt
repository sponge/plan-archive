  WOOO HOOO!  Giants patch!

  My PC game of the year pick is Baldur's Gate II.  Runners up are Giants and Red Alert 2.  Honorable mentions are Deus Ex and Icewind Dale.

  Time for me to go back to Kansas for Christmas.  I don't remember when I was last at home...its been a while.  Must have been sometime this last summer but I can't remember when.  Vacation is a drag though so I bought a new laptop so I can work on Duke.

  Go check out the totally fucking cool flash game Steve Garofalo at Epic did: www.rustedfaith.com.  Rusted Faith is his art site and he's recently put up RustedJacks a sweet game that features Garofalo's utterly ass kicking art.  (Can you say "Easily one of the best in the industry?"  Yes you can.)
