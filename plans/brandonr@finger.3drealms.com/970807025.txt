Every once in a while you pick up a new CD that immidiately goes on top of your favorite picks list and gets you slamming around your house again.  I just bought "Ancient Kings" by the band Bloodhammer and its fucking KICK ASS.  Hardcore black metal on the Northern Heritage label only available through online distribution from BlackMetal.com

I highly recommend the album to any fan to hard core metal music.  I also recently picked up the new Bloodthorn album "Onwards into Battle" and Peccatum's "Strangling from Within"

Peccatum is Isahn from Emperor with his wife Ihriel and Lord Pz.  Its a lot like a straight mix of Theatre of Tragedy and Emperor.  Highly recommended.

Bloud ok Jarna!
