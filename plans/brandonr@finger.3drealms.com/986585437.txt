Here's a shameless abuse of my .plan file:

I'm looking for anyone that might have old Absu or Melechesh albums they could hook me up with.  Would appreciate it very much.

Think they'll find a cure for cancer before Duke ships?  I don't know, but you can help contribute.  Duke Nukem has an enormous...team helping to find a cure for cancer!

The UD distributed processing client downloads and performs a variety of tasks on your machine in the background, particularly modeling drug interactions with target proteins.  The goal is to find particular types of drug-protein interactions that could help find a cancer cure.

SO, if you are interested in giving SETI the boot for a while and trying out something new, go to <A HREF="http://www.ud.com">http://www.ud.com/</A> and download the software.

Once you have it installed and running with an account, cruise over to the profile page and select "My Team Manager."

From the Team Manager menu, select "List All Teams" and then sort the teams by name.  Find the team called "Duke's Enormous Team" and join up!  We might even put a wager on it.  Maybe I'll give something away?  A copy of DNF when it's done?  We'll see!

(I changed that last part because Keith thought it could be interpreted to mean DNF would be done in six months which is not what I would want it to be interpreted as!)

(And yes, I did read the slashdot article about this particular service.  I, however, do not subscribe to slashdot long-bearded unix hacker mentalities and find this to be a perfectly interesting way to waste my bandwidth and CPU time.)
