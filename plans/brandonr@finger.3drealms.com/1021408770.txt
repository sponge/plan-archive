My Dark Elf Emperor's Hand is now level 31.  I've got 100 str, 100 int, almost 100 willpower.  Slowly working on them all.  100 Longsword, so I'm switching to the spear I think.  100 acrobatics.

I also got the Robe of St. Roris.  Bethesda: Why did you add this item?  It's stupid.  It's lame.  It's so powerful, it takes away the fun of the game.  The item, for those who do not know, is +15 health per second, +15 fatigue per second.  There is nothing in the game that I have encountered, save Vivec himself, that can kill you while wearing this robe.  You can allow a Daedroth Lord to smack on you and you won't even feel it.  This item sucks.  It shouldn't have been added.

I enchanted a Daedric Longsword with 20-80 points of lightning damage.  The weapon is too powerful.  There is nothing I can't make short work of in a couple hits.  I'm leaving this item, the "Judgement of Septim" on my desk in my Hlaalu stronghold.  I also made two rings of +8 jump.  With the endless fatigue from the robe, I can cross the world in no time.  I'm leaving those behind as well.

The robe, I turned in to become Grandmaster of the House Hlaalu.  The items were so powerful the game wasn't interesting.  I could walk through quests without any risk at all.  So I'm hanging them up.

Growl.  I shouldn't have to do stuff like that.  When I get a cool powerful item, it should be reasonable, not Monty Haul.

I also decided not to use the Adamantium Helm of Tohan or the Helm of Orwyn Bearclaw.  Both are insanely superpowered.

So currently, I'm equipped with a full set of Ordinator armor and an ebony spear.

Here's to another 30 levels.
