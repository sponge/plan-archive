Well, it sucks that Emperor is breaking up, but at least they have a new album coming out.  Hopefully I'll be able to snag a listen to a promo copy soon :)

On the bright side, Zyklon is coming to Dallas soon.

These terrorist attacks have really sucked.  Not only was the Judas Priest show with Iced Earth cancelled because of flight issues, but Dimmu Borgir has also pulled out of an upcoming show for the same reasons.  Damn terrorists.  Why can't they attack in the middle of winter when I don't want to go out to shows?

Lately, I've been listening to a lot of old Absu...the old "Barathrum VITRIOL" album specifically...as well as some Shub Niggurath and Dark Storm.  (Dark Storm is great, I believe one of the guys from Maniac Butcher may be a member.)  Also, there's a cool album out called "Blood on the Moon" by a band called Myrddraal.  They play classic heavy black metal, but their lyrics are inspired by the Wheel of Time.

I've also been on a Cradle kick and "Bitter Suites to Succubi" sounds better each time I listen to it.
