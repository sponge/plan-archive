I finished Baldur's Gate 2 after something like 55 hours of gameplay.  Huzzah and Excelsior!  What a kick ass game.  The ending rocks and I think I liked the game better than Planescape overall.  Bioware continues to kick ass in the realm of RPGs.  I don't think I ever want to play a SquareSoft game again.

In the console world I've been playing San Fransisco Rush 2049 for Dreamcast.  This game rocks!  All sorts of stuff to unlock and secrets to find.  Unlocking hidden features really needs to make it more into PC games, it definitely lends itself to replayability.
