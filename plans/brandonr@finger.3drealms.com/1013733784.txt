<IMG SRC="http://www.animemuyo.com/washu/ted.jpg">God did Trent Reznor's music for Quake suck.  I'm listening to the old Doom and Doom 2 music by Bobby Prince.  That stuff was greatness.  Doom 3 needs fully orchestrated scary stuff like this.  Not industrial noise that will make me want to break my speakers!

Give me fully orchestrated version of "The End of Doom"!!!!!
