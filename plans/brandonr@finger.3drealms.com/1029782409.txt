Wow, lots of positive responses on both the subjects of Nightwish and Voyager.

Voyager apparently will be heading to DVD, although the word isn't official.  People are expecting it sometime late 2003, after Deep Space 9.

If you want to check out Nightwish go to <A HREF="http://www.nightwish.com/">www.nightwish.com</A>.  They are an operatic metal band with a female vocalist.

In my spare time I've been playing a lot of Magic Online.  I've managed to collect a complete set of Invasion and a complete set of Torment.  Almost a complete set of Judgement and 7E.  I'm a ton of rares short of a Ps, Ap, or Od set.

The game is hellishly addictive...and probably even more evil than a MMRPG because it can easily cost more.  One nice change from an MMRPG is that you can easily play a game or so for a short time and then do something else (whereas EverQuest takes one hour to get to where your going and one hour to get back).

The only drawback would be the pleasantness of the other players.  They are all punks, as far as I can tell.  Then again, when else will you get a chance to be insulted by famous pro tour players who think Magic was invented for them?

If you haven't ever played Magic before, it is definitely worth checking out...just steer clear of the draft rooms unless you are wearing a fire retardant suit (and good, playing draft in Magic Online is basically giving away money, unless you are skilled).
