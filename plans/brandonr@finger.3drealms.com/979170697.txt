Go check out Awfulmon at www.somethingawful.com.  It rocks!

Levelord is a bit overpowered though.  I use his nude photo in combination with the belly attack to devastating results.  The occaisional bucket of chicken helps too!

Carmack is probably the second most powerful I played with.  The ability to confuse your enemy with a well timed BSP Tree Lecture rocks.  Although Jason Hall's head crushing ability works too.

CliffyB is pretty weak.  I kept getting my ass kicked when I played as him.

:P
