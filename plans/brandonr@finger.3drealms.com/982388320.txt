I can't wait.  Man, I cannot wait.

So...the other day I'm asleep and I hear a crunching sound.  I sort of half wake-up and think "sounds like somebody's car got hit out in the parking lot."  Then I slip back into sleep.  A few minutes later I hear knocking on my door.  I go down there and this guy says "Uh, do you own a black Miata..."

Damn.

The guy, in typical Texas fashion, was driving a huge steel truck and didn't see my little Miata.  The back is all crunched to hell and, to top it off, the trunk won't close.  Now...I wasn't really concerned about the trunk at first, but I didn't think about the little light inside.  Now my battery is drained.

Blah.
