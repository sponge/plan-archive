3DR Tradition?  Bite me Evil Avatar!  I've always posted a little bit or a lot about games I've played that I like.  I like Giants so I'm gonna post about it.  Not like I can use this space for posting interesting info about Duke.

Congratulations on the Blue's News team for the site redesign, its pretty cool.  It took me off guard when I opened my browser today and saw the new design.  At first it didn't register then I did a double take, hehe :)

Lately I've been receiving lots of Japanese spam.  Its weird, because I'm not quite sure how a Japanese spam agency got my email address.  Maybe through some game related site?  Anyway, Japanese spam seems to consist entirely of animated gifs of flying Kanji/Katakana characters and little cute animals giving me a peace sign.  Its quite a bit more entertaining than normal American Infomercialspam.
