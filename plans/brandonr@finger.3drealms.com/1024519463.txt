Finished Morrowind a couple weeks back.  Best RPG of all time.  Of course, now I've got Neverwinter Nights sitting on my desk.

Have to finish Grand Theft Auto 3 first.  (Playing it on the PC of course.)  Then there is Warcraft III right around the corner which, I believe, has higher priority than Neverwinter Nights...we'll see.

I've also been playing Ghost Recon after a friend recommended it to me.  Can't believe I missed this game.  Oh...and then there is "The Sum of All Fears" which is like Rainbow Six light.  It's okay, but probably best in cooperative mode.

After hours at the office we've been watching an extremely cool Danish television miniseries called "The Kingdom."  It's a ghost/suspense story that takes place in a massive hospital.  The primary theme is the evils of the reign of science over spirituality...something I don't agree with...but it is extremely well acted, written and filmed.  Recommended to anyone who can find a copy of it.

Hail the ancient times!  Lord Proscriptor is working on a new Absu album, a new Melechesh album (hails Ashmedi!!!), a new solo album, and a new Demonic Christ album (Proscriptor + Dana Clayton, can black metal get any better??).

Bal-Sagoth is working on their sixth album and I wrote to Lord Byron who said that it will not be their last.  Blodu ok Jarna!
