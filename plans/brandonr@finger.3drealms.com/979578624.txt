Seven hails from sunken Lemuria!  Seven hails from the Ape-God Xultha!

It is a good day indeed.  The mighty barbarian war metal band "<A HREF="http://www.bal-sagoth.freeserve.co.uk/">Bal-Sagoth</A>" has announced the completion of their fifth opus, "Atlantis Ascendant!"  The Official Bal-Sagoth Website has been updated with a new message from the mighty Warlord himself, Lord Byron!

The album is scheduled for release on 2/4/01.  However, I believe that is written in the British style, so the date would be April 2nd not Feburary 4th.

The website also lists the full track listing.  Most exciting is the news that the album will include the third part of the Epic tale "The Splendor Of A Thousand Swords Gleaming Beneath The Blazon Of The Hyperborean Empire."  It appears that the album begins in the ancient lands of Atlantis and cuts a bloody path south to the Lost Cities of Antarctica!

Blodu ok Jarna!

Also the seminal Dallas, TX Sumerian war metal band, <A HREF="http://www.digitalabyss.org/absu/">Absu</A>, have completed their latest album "Tara."  With the release of the album, Absu is going to play a US tour.  A US tour is very rare for Absu, as their fanbase is largely European.  I would call upon all those who seek to rise above the shackles of humanity to march mightily forward in support of Absu and the cause of ancient Sumer.  From Kislimu to Tebetu to Shabatu, it is rare indeed to find opportunity to see this mighty force of heathen metal in action upon our own American soil.

In case anyone is interested in the sources of my code maddened rantings, I have posted my MP3 list.  I do not trade MP3s and I do not use Napster.  These are all encoded albums that I own:

The only thing I immidiately see missing from this list is a Maniac Butcher album I just got and haven't encoded yet.

Blackmetal.com has just recently received a restock of some old Absu and Immortal albums.  I urge anyone interested in exploring the realms of dark fantastic metal to get Absu's "The Sun of Tiphareth" while you can.  Also grab a copy of Bal-Sagoth's multiverse spanning sci-fi Epic "The Power Cosmic."

"Can you not see the coils of the worm all about you?  Can you not hear the writhing of the worm beneath you?  Can you not scent the breath of the worm riding the wind?  Can you not touch the skin of the worm in all that surrounds you?  Can you not taste the ichors of the worm upon your tongue?  Do dreams of the worm not haunt your slumber?"
- Bal-Sagoth, 'In the raven-haunted forests of Darkenhold, where shadows reign and the hues of sunlight never dance...'
