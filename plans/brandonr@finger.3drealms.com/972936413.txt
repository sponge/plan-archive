Whoa!  Happy Birthday to Alan Willard who is now 26 and much more scraggly looking than he was last year.

Alan, you've lived over a quarter of a century now...  Congratulations on getting old. :)

Red Alert 2 rocks the house down.  I've finished both single player campaigns and played a lot of matches online and its definitely the best RTS to come out in a while.  (And its not even 3D! Wow! Go figure huh?)

On Friday night I played several great matches against Steve Blackburn (3D Realms Vice-President of Operations).  In the first match, Steve teamed up with Jess Crable, our AI programmer.  I was a little out-matched going one-on-two, but I ultimately won.

During the match, I found some pretty hilarious tactics.  You can use Crazy Ivan to attach bombs on your Russian Huskies making explosive attack dogs.  Not very effective, but it'll make your enemy laugh. :)  

In our second game, Steve blasted the hell out of me in the first two minutes of the match by sending a Libyan nuke truck after me.  We then proceded to ban Libyan nuke trucks from the office. :)

(My online record is 5-1, with every match being determined in the build-order phase and the rush.  The game is rather StarCrafty in that respect.  You have to really know your units.  The Libyan nuke truck is far too powerful.)

I highly recommend the game.  The single player game isn't too challenging (they need a StarCraft style tiered campaign), but its fun and a great introduction to the units for online play.

My games with Blackburn all lasted about an hour each, except for that second one, so the game balance is there if you find a good opponent.
