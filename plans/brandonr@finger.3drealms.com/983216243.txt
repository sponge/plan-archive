I highly recommend "Clive Barker's Undying."  It's an excellent shooter with some top notch level design, texture work, and gameplay.  The creatures you fight are really cool and there are a lot of neat puzzles to solve.

I beat the game this past weekend.  The boss fights in Undying are excellent.  The last boss was quite challenging.

Now I'm going to start on Heart of Winter.  I dusted off my evil party of planeswalking hellions last night and checked their equipment.  Several of my characters are carting around cursed items...not because I might find a use for them, but because it seems to be the in-character thing to do.  I also have kept all the cool evil inventory items I found, like the armor "Bathed-in-Blood" and another suit of armor christened in the blood of thirteen sacrified elvish maidens.  Great stuff.
