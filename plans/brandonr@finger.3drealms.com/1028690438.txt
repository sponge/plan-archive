I've had my Tivo trained on Voyager, a show I really love, but have only seen about three seasons (when it started).  I've started watching it again and its damn frustrating to see them run episodes out of order.  They were showing seasons four and five a few weeks ago, but have suddenly switched to season seven for some reason.  At this point I really don't want to watch it, because I want to see what happens in prior seasons before these.  Argh!

Why don't they run the episodes in order?  It seems that Sci-Fi has no problem running Babylon 5 in order.

I was excited because I was able to start watching about where I had left off before, but now I'm seeing episodes that happen long after the ship regains contact with the federation...or the delta flyer is built...stuff I haven't even seen!  Argh!

Is there any likelyhood of a complete Voyager DVD anthology?  I can't find any clear information on google...

The Next Gen DVD sets are $99.00 a piece!  A lot of episodes but still...man those early seasons were crap too.

There are 80 or so Voyager episodes on VHS (or so it seems from amazon?) and 180 or so Deep Space Nine episodes.  I guess that means they might eventually release them on DVD.  I guess that means I can stop watching the damn show on Tivo.

There is a new Nightwish album out, Century Child, but it is currently unavailable in the US.
