Isn't Washu cute?

Check this link out:

That's the Official Iron Chef book.  The interesting thing about the link is the "Customers who bought this book also bought" section.  The first entry is "The First Quarter: A 25-year History of Video Games."

I love Iron Chef.  I've run into a bunch of other game programmers that like it too.  Weird huh?  I can't cook at all...

It must be the allure of Japanese television.  I can't stand American television.  Until I got my Tivo, I didn't watch TV at all.  Now I just watch Iron Chef, Dragonball Z, Tenchi, and Sailor Moon.

American television shoots for the lowest common denominator.  I take pride in the fact that I haven't watched a single episode of "Survivor" nor will I ever.  I'd rather spend my time watching cute animated teenage girls run around fighting evil with the power of love and hearts than participate in a neo-modern social experiment at the hands of the faceless monolithic broadcasting corporations.

Allez Cuisine!

So Richard Gray, a level designer at Ritual, has been doing this Dallas Area Game Developer Drinking Night thing.  I can't think for the life of me why game developers would want to hang around with other game developers.  Anonymous net based social interaction is already painful enough...to add some kind of physical sight/sound interface on top of it strikes me as being patently masochistic.

Ah, Washu...
