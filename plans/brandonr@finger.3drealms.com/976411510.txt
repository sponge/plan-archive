Giants: Citizen Kabuto, rocks.  Its extremely funny and has great gameplay.  Add it to your Christmas list!  Its the best "Holliday Season" game I've played yet.  Well worth your time.

The game really surprised me.  I hadn't really followed its development or looked any many of the screenshots and what not.  When I started it up, I didn't know what to expect.  The opening cutscene was great and had me rolling on the floor laughing.
