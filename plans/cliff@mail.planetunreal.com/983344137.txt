Tonight's episode of Buffy tied for my Favorite Episode alongside the Season 2 ending - "Becoming."

Introducing a very real threat to Buffy – in the form of a real medical problem with her mother- which later claimed her mom’s life – was the perfect element for showing what the characters are made of. They’ve always been able to deal with what comes up, be it the end of the earth or a giant serpent demon thing. But when a real medical threat comes up, they were helpless. In the midst of all the supernatural this was a refreshing story element that provided a great catalyst for character growth.

The bit where the Buffy hears the Doctor say "I'm lying to you about the pain to make you feel better" even though his lips fail to match this - you realize that he said something like "Your mother felt very little pain" but Buffy heard the truth - as did the audience.

Tonight’s episode felt like a film; the production quality, the shots, everything was top notch.

The growth of Anya; normally a one-line joke of a girl; discovering her new humanity was excellent. She finally breaks down from the confusion of the death and sheds her tears – and is only more confused by this.

I'm really surprised at how well the writers have managed to integrate Dawn into the story. Her character could have easily been turned into a "Scrappy Doo," which would have ruined the show, but the Michelle Trachenberg has delivered a great, tortured performance of a girl who doesn't know what she is...if she's real or not...and how she fits into the world that she believed was her life until she found out the truth. The part where she cut her arms and asked if she was real to a shocked Scooby Gang was excellent. The episode where Buffy went into the trance and realized that Dawn wasn’t originally part of their lives was equally great.

In the hands of lesser writers and actors, Willow and Tara would have become a bad lesbian stereotype but on this show you believe their relationship. You continue to wonder if this is for real, or if it is a situation of Willow "college girl experimenting" - and if Tara will be hurt by a shift in Willow's sexuality later in the series.

I'm glad Riley is gone. I never liked his character. The whole bit about him sneaking out to be fed on by the very vermin that Buffy is dedicated to killing was such a great metaphor for cheating. (Not very subtle, mind you, but cool regardless.) His exit was done well; Xander nudging Buffy into realizing that she does care about Riley, only to show up too late. Sure, it’s a cliché, but I’d rather have a cliché that’s done well in my shows/films than original ideas that are executed poorly.

The change in Spike from Slayer Hater to Buffy Lover is too entertaining for words. A couple of weeks ago when Spike declared his love you know Buffy may have had some sort of spark but she'd never admit it or let it happen - if she didn't care then she wouldn't hate spike so passionately. There's a thin line between love and hate and Spike crossed over. The Wife wants them to get together but that would make for a lame show. I’m hoping that in the final battle with Glory this season Spike has to make a potentially lethal sacrifice for Buffy. I’m curious to see how the “Make me a robot” bit pans out. I’m skeptical about that one.

Initially I hated the whole idea of Glory as a villain, but ever since the twist that revealed that she and Ben are one and the same my faith has been restored a bit. I'm a bit worried about the whole "She's a God" bit, because we could be crossing over into Xena-ville, which would be some cheesy shit.

I hope Faith returns as a vampire eventually. Eliza Dukshu is great.

Oh, and if anyone knows anything about what happens later in the season (spoilers) I really don’t want to know. I prefer to be surprised by this excellent show.
