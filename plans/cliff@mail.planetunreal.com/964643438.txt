OK, OK, Thanks for all the great links on Car Mp3 players. =)


---------------------

I hate CD's. I'm tired of them. They scratch, they're cumbersome, and they're a waste of space.

Does anyone have any reliable information about MP3 players for your car?

I don't want one of these ones that you still have to put a CD in (which it rips the music off of.) I want one where I just detach a unit, hook it up to my PC via USB and POW I'm set.

Any leads?

Here's a tip:

If your employee isn't happy, he will find a way to leave. No matter what you do to him. It is your responsibility as an employer to provide competitive wages, appropriate benefits, a healthy environment, and COOL STUFF to work on. If you need to resort to bullshit to keep them, then they're not people you'd want to keep anyways. 

Happy developers have the PASSION. 

The PASSION is what makes #1 titles.

Slavery is illegal in the USA, kids.

Geesh. I got married, went on a honeymoon, and bought a house (and moved in) all within a short time period. I wouldn't suggest doing it all at once, it damn near killed my wife and I. It's nice to get back into the Work Groove after all that craziness.

I beat Deus Ex and got all 3 endings.

It is really nice to see a title that breaks through many genres at once so that people have a hard time pigeonholing the title into "RPG" or "FPS." It's all that and more. I strongly suggest checking it out, and I'm not just saying that because it uses our engine.

Greenmarine's favorite word is "Luddite." FYI.

I've decided to only put lengthy personal musings into a mailing list available at www.cliffyb.com. Plan updates will be about games and Epic from here on out.

Geoff Keighley is a top notch gaming journalist. His "behind the games" stories are great, they're well written and really tell a story. (www.gameslice.com)

I like reading stories on other developers, but often the people asking the questions can't seem to come up with anything besides:

"How did you get into the gaming industry?"
"What is your favorite game?"
"What do you think the future of the industry is?"

Or, they go the complete other way and ask stuff like:

"Billy Wilson versus Joe C in a jello wrestling match. Who wins?"

I'd like to read more articles that really attempt to get into the heads of developers, and some of Geoff's stuff does that really well.

BTW, I'm getting married June 11th. Send me presents. hehe =)

Damn, Looking Glass closed up shop. It's official...there's no justice in the world.

I remember when I saw the advertisements for Ultima Underworld on the back of CGW years ago. I had heard of Doom but I had yet to see the leaked alpha, so this was my first encounter with something that was 3d and texture mapped at the same time. It blew my mind...the sequence of shots approaching the grate thrilled me. As much as I (and everyone else) love and remember Doom I have to say that Doom's great graphical impact was lessened by UU quite a bit for me.

Recently I had the pleasure of beating System Shock 2. It was hard as hell but was so very rewarding. It's always been up there with Half-Life on my top list of compelling First Person titles.

And while I haven't had the time to finish Thief 1 and 2 (too damned busy) they're awesome too. The first time I made a noise and a guard was seeking me out a mere two feet in front of me as I stayed perfectly still with my blackjack raised was right up there with the best moments in gaming history.

Great sound work in those games too... who can forget the chilling voice of the Cyborg Midwives in SS2 or the beeping of the camera system as it spots you...or the grumbling of the guards as they complain about having to work the night shift in Thief...

I digress. I'm depressing myself, too.

-----------------------------



My feet are in the process of recovering from the insanity that is E3. I am also suffering from Post E3 depression. Am I the only one who is a bit bummed to see the show end? I mean, seeing all the great new titles, the exciting announcements, seeing old friends and showing your new product like a proud papa just adds up to way too much fun.

I got to meet ICE T and Coolio. That was cool as shit, I've been listening to Ice ever since Rhyme Pays and I love every one of his albums. He said I had nice threads. My medallion was larger than Coolio's, too. 

LOL!

(Thanks to Jason Hall for getting me in to see ICE! =))

By the end of the first day I was kicking some ass with that UT Ps2 controller from demoing so much. A lot of PC gamers came over to see it and lamented about the controller. I want to remind everyone:

1. It CAN be used to frag rather well, it just takes a lot of getting used to.
2. We'll support keyboard and mouse for Ps2 regardless.

Asia Carrera is a UT fan, some band off of MP3.com made a song about UT, our games are cross-platform, UT was all over the show, and our mod community is thriving. 

Life is Good. Must...not...get...complacent!

The Halo presentation was well worth the wait. Some great movie-like action in there, I hope it translates well to gameplay. The Red Faction destructable geometry was great, I loved watching the player control the lava flow by blowing holes in the ground and channeling it.

Metal Gear Solid 2 is going to change EVERYTHING. I was talking to someone who was discussing making a film based on the MGS franchise and I had the realization that there's now way anyone could make a film that would compete with the action excitement that that game is going to deliver. This is going to be a landmark title in the history of gaming, and I am truly humbled by the talent over there!

WARNING!

GEEK NOSTALGIA ALERT!

Like most others my age, I was not only raised on Atari, Sega and Nintendo… I was raised on Giant Robots!

My brother visited my mom’s house recently and dug out our Transformer collection and FedEx’d me a pile of them. He used to collect the Decepticons, I’d collect the Autobots. They provided us with countless hours of enjoyment. I remember we were initially into the Go-Bots; we had acquired a couple of them and were enjoying them until we saw the commercials for the Transformers at which point we realized how sucky the Go-Bots were and abandoned them.

We went over to the five and dime in Andover, Mass. and I got “Bluestreak” while he got “Thundercracker.” At that point a line in the sand was drawn, my brother would forever be a Decepticon and I would always be an Autobot. It’s amazing how far you can stretch paper route cash on toys when you’re determined enough. We’d ask for TF’s for our birthdays, Christmas, and any other occasion we could think of.  I remember my mother was uncomfortable with buying Megatron for my brother because he was a gun… a Walther p38, nonetheless. I think about that toy now and if you walked around in public with it you’d get your ass shot or arrested!

We swung by Child World one day when we were driving into Boston and I picked up Optimus Prime. I always loved Prime, he was the coolest toy and his character kicked total ass on the cartoon series.

That’s why the film was so upsetting! When Optimus Prime died I was totally bummed out… they then had to go replace him with that lamer Rodimus Prime and the TV series went to shit. Galvatron just owned everyone in the film and they then had to make him land in that pile of space goo, turning him into a blathering idiot. My brother and I still argue about who won that battle, Megatron or Prime. If Hot Rod hadn’t got in the way… dammit! Gotta admit, though, the relationship between Daniel and Hot Rod was great; what kid hadn’t dreamt of having a giant ass kicking robot for a friend? I think that’s part of why I loved “Iron Giant” so much, BTW.

I swear, the TF film still holds up today, the animation was spectacular. I remember my jaw dropping when I was in the theater and I heard Spike say “Oh SHIT!” That was the pinnacle of Geek Zen, hearing that kind of language in the movie you’d been waiting for.

Ah, well, I digress…

Precursor to my Transformer obsession was “Force Five.”

http://www.concentric.net/~marsala9/force5.html

You can find some great stuff on this site about the series. I recently found a 7” tall, Die Cast Metal “Grandizer” on Ebay and I’m trying to collect all 3 of the Starvengers. I picked up several of the videos of the series on Amazon, just do a search and you’ll find them. GRANDIZER GO! hehe

We used to love watching that after school, as well as “Starblazers.” Starblazers was a another series that 0wned.

Okay, I’m going to go back to my geek cave now. =)

------------------------------
DISCLAIMER: I am simply setting the record straight on what this mod does and why Epic does not support it or encourage its use.

-On ZeroPing-

Lag has been a factor in network first person shooters like UT and Q3A, since the original release of QuakeWorld.  When I first saw ZeroPing for UT, I thought that a mere modmaker had finally managed to do what the Sweeneys and Carmacks of this world could not do - get rid of lag once and for all.

Being a lowly game designer and knowing absolutely nothing about the way network code works, I was forced to consult the wisdom of some programmers at Epic - Jack Porter, Brandon Reinhart and Steven Polge. What I learned disturbed me deeply, as the ZeroPing mod for UT is rapidly gaining popularity online.

To explain why ZeroPing (“ZP”) is unfair, we have to examine the way a network game works.

In a regular game of UT or Q3A, the server is God.  The outcome of all gameplay is decided by the server.  When you press your strafe key, your client sends a message to the server to tell it that you just started to strafe.  Your computer performs 'prediction' - performing the strafe move locally on your UT client.  Most of the time the server agrees on your final position, but sometimes it's necessary for the server to correct the client's location slightly.  There could be an explosion nearby which transfers momentum to you, or there could be another player which blocks your strafe.

The position of other players is a different story.  The server sends the location of other players to your client, and also sends information about their current direction and velocity.  This information takes a period of time to reach your client.  This time is about half your ping time (as your ping is calculated as the round trip time from your client to the server and back again).  Your client predicts their location based on this information, until you get the next update on the player's actual position from the server.

So the world you're running around in on your UT client is an approximation of the game running on the server.  Say your current ping is 100ms.  The location of other players is not always exactly correct, as you only know where they were 50ms ago, and where they were heading. They might have changed direction and you won't know for another 50ms.

When you press the fire button, a message gets sent to the server to let the server know that you fired.  In the case of instant hit weapons like the UT Sniper Rifle, the server does a line trace to see if you hit anyone. This is fair, because the server knows exactly where each player is, and has the most recent information about their position.  It can make a fair assessment as to whether you really hit the guy or not.

What ZP does is give that judging responsibility to the client. Using the approximate information the client has predicted, the client checks to see if the guy was lined up with your crosshair and tells the server "yep, you hit him".  While this might seem great to the camping bastard firing the sniper rifle, it sucks if you're the guy he's firing at.  Because you know full well you hid behind the pillar in time, but because the camper doesn't have the latest information on your position, he thought you were in full view.

To demonstrate how unfair this is, I'll describe an extreme case of potential ZP exploitation.  You see a room full of guys on your screen.  You quickly unplug your Ethernet cable.  Your client can no longer receive any information from the server, so it keeps predicting these players running in a straight line with the velocity the server last sent you, until they hit a wall. You can then walk up to them at your leisure and blow their heads off with the sniper rifle.  Then, quickly plug your network cable back in. Your client will send the message "I killed these five guys" to the server, and the server will believe you.

ZP makes bad players with bad network connections think they can play really well, at the expense of everyone else in the game.  If you want to clean up using ZP, join a server in eastern Europe.  You'll whup ass because you'll be so lagged out.

Ping is a fact of life; you can't make it disappear (and still have a fair game) with a few lines of UnrealScript trickery. While I commend the efforts of the author to attempt to make a smoother online experience, I believe that anyone who is serious about their gaming won’t use this mod.

http://newsweek.com/nw-srv/printed/us/st/a16818-2000feb27.htm

Upon reading Jack Kroll's editorial, one might infer that he believes the only medium that can convey emotion to the user is film.

Emotion is in a person's head and heart, not on the screen.

When film first came along, proponents of live theatre were skeptical of its ability to convey emotion. After all, the audience was not watching live people acting, they were watching pre-recorded images that were being played back on a flat screen. How could this medium possibly ever cause a viewer to cry because of the death of a character, or become excited by conflict?

How then, is it possible, to be brought to tears by a novel? To feel excited by a song? To be titillated by a sensual painting? A novel lacks the smile of an actress. Most great paintings lack photorealism yet are still able to evoke emotion from the viewer.

I have been playing electronic entertainment all my life. I was born and raised on it. I have shed tears at stories of love, I have thrilled to battles won by brave warriors, and I have had crushes on digital princesses.

Is it pretentious for a designer to consider himself an artist? No. In fact, his medium is the most innovative and exciting new frontier for artists everywhere. If a character dies in a film it can tug at the emotions of the audience. However, in a game, if a character dies who has saved the gamer's life then the gamer feels responsible. This creates an emotional bond that no other form of media can. If a sexy femme fatale crosses her legs in a digital interrogation then the player has the choice of whether or not he's going to risk being thrown off the case for pursuing her. In film, the viewer just sits there and watches. The most emotional entertainment experiences for myself, and a generation, have occurred during titles such as "Lunar," "Final Fantasy," and "System Shock"

An active form of entertainment can create far more emotion in the user than a passive form. In gaming, the story is driven forward and defined by the user's actions. He commits himself emotionally more, because he's investing his own time and ability into it.

Games are no longer child's play, they are the freshest and most exciting medium of artistry for the new Millenium.

I'm speaking at the Computer Game Developer's conference this year.

Last year I did a round table on 3d shooter design that went pretty well, so I figured this year I'd take a stab at a lecture.

Those interested in learning my opinions on where the role of the designer, as well as many common and advanced design techniques are welcome to attend and hear me run my lil' mouth for an hour or so. ;)

The session is 4404 and is listed at

I'm speaking at the same time as Dave Perry of Shiny Entertainment. I hear he's a good speaker. I'm going to have to sabotage his talk by bribing more people to come to my lecture! Muhuhaha!

After the conference I'll be posting my written materials on my website at www.cliffyb.com. It will be the debut of something useful on my personal homepage.

INFILTRATION ROCKS!

http://www.planetunreal.com/infiltration/

We need more servers running this Mod. This is going to be some ass-kicking stuff if these guys manage to implement even 1/4th of the features they have planned. It is amazing how much a mod like this can change the gameplay of any of UT's gametypes. I'm especially impressed with how well Assault plays with Infiltration.

In other news, I'd be a liar if I said the snow here hasn't slowed down the forthcoming free-release Epic Bonus Pack.

For those of you who are patiently waiting for this I can tell you that all the content is ready to go and we're testing it.

[PIMP HAT OFF]
--------------------
I enjoy perusing the forums where UT gamers get to 
voice their opinions. I consider it part of my job as well.

However, I feel the need to clarify some confusion that 
I've noticed in regards to the maps that we chose to ship 
with in UT.

Give me a chance to address some of these concerns, and 
use my plan file for Good.

1. "Just because you make a spaceship or a boat doesn't 
mean it plays well!"

You seem more Old School. I'd suggest playing the 
following maps then:

DM-Zeto
DM-Deck16][
DM-Grinder
DM-Codex
DM-Curse][
DM-Turbine
DM-Liandri
DM-Pressure
DM-Tempest

These are maps that were made just for the gameplay, the 
architecture is dictated by the gameplay. These maps are 
more traditional, mazey DM.

2. "These maps are bland! I don't want a cramped mazey 
bland area; been there done that! Show me something new!"

I'd suggest playing the following maps then:

DM-Gothic
DM-Hyperblast
DM-KGalleon
DM-Peak
DM-Barricade
DM-Phobos
DM-Morpheus
DM-Conveyor

The Unreal Engine handles interior and exterior 
spaces extremely well and maps like Peak and 
Hyperblast really take advantage of this. These 
maps are original, you get to frag in really 
exquisite environments. Sure, they may not be 
the ones you play in a tourney, but they sure 
have that "wow" factor.

3. "These CTF maps aren't symmetrical! These 
CTF maps are too tight!"

The issue of symmetry is something we really 
beat ourselves up over when making the UT maps. 
At the end of the day we went with a mixed 
selection; some maps were symmetrical while 
others weren't. The asymmetrical maps required 
a ton of testing and we feel that they're pretty 
well balanced. For instance, in CTF-Command the 
blue base has a slow lift and long ramp to get 
to the flag, but there's a back entrance you can 
access fairly easily if you're good with the 
translocator. In CTF-November there's a long 
winding staircase to the blue base, but once you 
get the flag you can just drop right out of it. 
In the red base there's a long pipe leading to 
the flag that you have to run through to get in 
and out of the base.

If you'd prefer more open CTF maps then I'd suggest:

CTF-Face and CTF-LavaGiant

These maps also play extremely well in low-gravity 
mode. Remember, dodging is very useful in low-grav. 
You can zip around maps easily using it.

Oh, also, server admins: Please don't run TURBO 
assault servers. It kind of kills the point of the 
game where you can destroy the assault target in 8 
seconds flat. :P

One of the reasons we wound up with over 50 maps in 
UT (besides having some really hard working level 
designers) is because we wanted to make sure we 
appealed to the broadest audience possible. Some 
people like the gimmicky maps, others like the more 
traditional DM maps, others prefer to fight in realistic 
locations. It's all there! If you don't like playing 
one kind of map then give the game a minute as the server 










	The Melee weapon. The regular fire charges up as you hold it. 
Simply keep the button held and walk up to and touch someone (while 
still holding the button, it takes 2-3 seconds to get to a full 
charge.) This will cause serious damage. If they're wounded or are 
lacking armour, chances are you'll kill 'em. You can use the regular 
fire to "impact jump" to higher areas at the risk of some damage. 
Simply charge the tool, look down, jump and release.
	The alt fire can deflect non-trace (hitscan) projectiles if 
you time it right. It also damages foes but is more useful for 
defense rather than offense.

-Enforcer(s)
	It is a handgun. (duh) Regular fire is slower but more accurate, 
alt fire is less accurate but faster. You can get 2 of them for John 
Woo action. They suddenly become VERY useful at that point.

-Shock Rifle
	Similar to the ASMD- the gun is INSTANT HIT, even though the 
effect sears the air after the shot fires through. Regular fire does a 
good amount of damage and imparts a LOT of momentum on foes. If you are 
playing DM-MORPHEUS, it is very useful for knocking people off the 
skyscrapers. Alt-fire shoots slower moving plasma balls. You can combo 
this like in Unreal1 by shooting the alt fire blob with the regular fire.


-Minigun
	Regular fire- more accurate, slower, alt fire- less accurate, 
faster. Eats up a lot of ammo. Pretty useful when you have the Damage 
Amp. ("Udamage.")


-Pulse Gun
	Regular fire- fast firing plasma balls. Very strong, but you 
have to lead your targets. Alt fire- Lighting shaft of plasma. Has a 
limited range but is very useful, especially with the Udamage. It is 
like a knife through butter when you have the Udamage and use the 
altfire.

-Rocket Launcher
	Regular fire- fires rockets, hold button for up to 6, at which 
point it auto-releases. Alt fire lobs grenades, you can hold the 
button on this mode as well. IMPORTANT- If you are one of those who do 
not like this feature, you can turn it off now under 
OPTIONS-PREFERENCES-INPUT. However, bear in mind that those who learn 
and get used to the way the gun works will probably smear you. If you 
keep your crosshair on a foe then it will turn red and a beep will 
sound. Your rocket(s) are now homing, so let em fly. Finally, if you 
start loading up regular rockets and you hit the alt fire button while 
you're doing this your rockets will be released in a tight pattern 
instead of fanning out.

Gameplay
--------

-Dodging defaults to on. You can easily turn it off. I'd suggest 
getting used to it. It took me a couple of months during Unreal1's 
development, and now that I'm used to it I don't fall into lava or 
dodge accidentally. I use it well and I'm able to escape attacks quickly.
Bear in mind that dodging in low gravity will give you great momentum,
it is an easy way to zip around. Also, Dodging forward will make you 
flip forward.

-Feigndeath is bind-able in the regular menus. When you are faking, 
your name will not show up on other people's HUD's when they have their 
crosshairs on you. Oh, and remember, feigning death with the shieldbelt 
on is just dumb.

-Throw weapon is very useful in team games. You can bind this in the 
menus as well. When you hit this key you'll throw your current weapon 
out... use it to hook up your buddies with guns. It also has other 
interesting functions- one time in a firefight Alan was coming after me 
and I threw my gun into his hand (the Flak Cannon, it has a longer 
weapon switch time than many of the other guns) and I was able to blast 
him while he was confused and switching. It was like an action movie 
where one guy throws his gun to the other guy, says "catch" and shoots 
him. :)

-Weapon Prioritization is in the main menus and is very easy to 
navigate. Just drag your fav gun to the top, and the gun you like the 
least to the bottom. You can prioritize the translocator and impact 
hammer as well. I'd suggest making use of the SWITCH BEST WEAPON binding
