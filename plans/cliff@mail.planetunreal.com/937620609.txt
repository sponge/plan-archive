Yes, you too can run an Unreal Tournament Demo Server!

http://unreal.epicgames.com/DemoServers.htm

We're bottlenecking on servers out there... the servers that are up are
spilling over with gibbage... host a game! Be a l33t UT p1mp! Help us
out! I'll let you touch my shiny shirt at e3 next year! =)

For those of you who are curious- you can adjust the gamespeed to crank
up the action in UT. You can also adjust the amount of Air Control...

These features are great to add variety to your game!



--------
Okay, here are a few gameplay related notes on the demo that should help 
you whup ass like I do around here. :)

Weapons
-------
-Translocator
	This is on by default in CTF and Domination. If you want, you 
can turn it on for deathmatch when you start a server or a practice 
session. You can use it to get to hard to reach spots, telefragging 
opponents, or you can just leave it in a spot you want to return to 
later. Once you translocate, you can switch back to your previously 
selected weapon by doing the following: When you hit ALT FIRE to 
translocate, keep it held down. While it is held, you'll translocate, 
then hit regular fire again. You'll switch back to your last weapon 
right away.

-Impact Hammer
	The Melee weapon. The regular fire charges up as you hold it. 
Simply keep the button held and walk up to and touch someone (while 
still holding the button, it takes 2-3 seconds to get to a full 
charge.) This will cause serious damage. If they're wounded or are 
lacking armour, chances are you'll kill 'em. You can use the regular 
fire to "impact jump" to higher areas at the risk of some damage. 
Simply charge the tool, look down, jump and release.
	The alt fire can deflect non-trace (hitscan) projectiles if 
you time it right. It also damages foes but is more useful for 
defense rather than offense.

-Enforcer(s)
	It is a handgun. (duh) Regular fire is slower but more accurate, 
alt fire is less accurate but faster. You can get 2 of them for John 
Woo action. They suddenly become VERY useful at that point.

-Shock Rifle
	Similar to the ASMD- the gun is INSTANT HIT, even though the 
effect sears the air after the shot fires through. Regular fire does a 
good amount of damage and imparts a LOT of momentum on foes. If you are 
playing DM-MORPHEUS, it is very useful for knocking people off the 
skyscrapers. Alt-fire shoots slower moving plasma balls. You can combo 
this like in Unreal1 by shooting the alt fire blob with the regular fire.


-Minigun
	Regular fire- more accurate, slower, alt fire- less accurate, 
faster. Eats up a lot of ammo. Pretty useful when you have the Damage 
Amp. ("Udamage.")


-Pulse Gun
	Regular fire- fast firing plasma balls. Very strong, but you 
have to lead your targets. Alt fire- Lighting shaft of plasma. Has a 
limited range but is very useful, especially with the Udamage. It is 
like a knife through butter when you have the Udamage and use the 
altfire.

-Rocket Launcher
	Regular fire- fires rockets, hold button for up to 6, at which 
point it auto-releases. Alt fire lobs grenades, you can hold the 
button on this mode as well. IMPORTANT- If you are one of those who do 
not like this feature, you can turn it off now under 
OPTIONS-PREFERENCES-INPUT. However, bear in mind that those who learn 
and get used to the way the gun works will probably smear you. If you 
keep your crosshair on a foe then it will turn red and a beep will 
sound. Your rocket(s) are now homing, so let em fly. Finally, if you 
start loading up regular rockets and you hit the alt fire button while 
you're doing this your rockets will be released in a tight pattern 
instead of fanning out.

Gameplay
--------

-Dodging defaults to on. You can easily turn it off. I'd suggest 
getting used to it. It took me a couple of months during Unreal1's 
development, and now that I'm used to it I don't fall into lava or 
dodge accidentally. I use it well and I'm able to escape attacks quickly.
Bear in mind that dodging in low gravity will give you great momentum,
it is an easy way to zip around. Also, Dodging forward will make you 
flip forward.

-Feigndeath is bind-able in the regular menus. When you are faking, 
your name will not show up on other people's HUD's when they have their 
crosshairs on you. Oh, and remember, feigning death with the shieldbelt 
on is just dumb.

-Throw weapon is very useful in team games. You can bind this in the 
menus as well. When you hit this key you'll throw your current weapon 
out... use it to hook up your buddies with guns. It also has other 
interesting functions- one time in a firefight Alan was coming after me 
and I threw my gun into his hand (the Flak Cannon, it has a longer 
weapon switch time than many of the other guns) and I was able to blast 
him while he was confused and switching. It was like an action movie 
where one guy throws his gun to the other guy, says "catch" and shoots 
him. :)

-Weapon Prioritization is in the main menus and is very easy to 
navigate. Just drag your fav gun to the top, and the gun you like the 
least to the bottom. You can prioritize the translocator and impact 
hammer as well. I'd suggest making use of the SWITCH BEST WEAPON binding 
option, as this will switch to your highest priority weapon in your 
priority list when you press it. Very useful. [This is also another 
way to put the translocator away once you teleport.]

MAPS
----

-Map cycle lists
The default deathmatch map cycle list cycles Phobos and Turbine. 
Morpheus is a wide open low grav map that may not run as well as 
the other 2 maps online, and if you want to cycle it you'll need to
modify the map list when you're starting your server/practice session.

Phobos

-Jump boots are extremely useful in this space station map. 
-The central courtyard is one big clusterfuck, and if you go for the 
hidden shieldbelt down there you'll need those boots to high tail it 
to a higher level. 
-There are another pair of jump boots out near the armour/health 
vials/minigun, and you can use those to jump up on the outside of the 
space station and surprise foes. 
-Also, remember that you can "lift jump" in UT. It works like this- 
when riding a lift, and it is almost at the top, hit JUMP and you'll 
catch a lot of extra air. 
-If someone is controlling the tower in Phobos where the Damage Amp 
is, you can lift jump over them and spray down hot lead as you're 
falling towards them, they'll never know what hit them.
-Phobos CAN be played one on one, but you may spend a fair amount 
of time hunting.

Turbine

-The Amp can only be accessed by impact jumping. Yes, the bots will 
go for it. :) 
-There is a great camper spot up high somewhere near the highest 
minigun/health/armour.
-The shieldbelt is hidden behind a shootable wall in this map.
-Make sure you use audio cues in this map. They'll give away your 
foes' locations all over the place. :)
-Turbine can be played one on one without feeling too large.

Morpheus
-The Shock Rifle's regular fire is damned useful on this map. You 
can knock people off the buildings easily.
-Beware of combo-move monkeys on this map that hang out in the 
middle level.
-Impact jumping will give you a hell of a vertical edge on your 
foes. Try impact jumping and unloading rockets like mad on your 
foes as you're coming down.
-Pulse gun is very useful on this map. The alt fire will work 
wonders on a floating target.
-Morpheus can be played one on one without feeling too large.

That's about it for now. Make sure you play with the mutators; 
low grav instagib CTF is pretty nuts. :)

I'd like to welcome James Green to the Epic team!

James is a great modeler/animator/artist who has cool hair and a cool
attitude.

Plus, he hates the sunlight just like the rest of us. He'll fit in well
at Epic.

ROCK!


--------------------------------

I never played the first System Shock, but I really enjoyed the second
one. Some great storytelling, pacing, and detail in it. Like Brandon,
I disliked the end as well. No one should try organic levels until we
have tons of polys/nurbs/real curves/etc... :)

Anyways, I had to mention that Tracie Spencer is a talented foxy lady.

Her CD is rockful.

In other news, finding someone to marry you who won't put all sorts of 
religious crap in your ceremony in the South is like trying to find a 
needle in a haystack.
