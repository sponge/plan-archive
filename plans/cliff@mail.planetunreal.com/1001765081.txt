So, I beat Silent Hill 2 tonight. I had previously finished the first one a couple of years ago so I was interested in seeing the sequel.

The graphics are excellent. The lighting and particle effects are stunning, the atmosphere is second to none, and the audio work is some of the best I have ever heard in a game.

Moments of the game were very unsettling and eerie. It is one of the scariest games I've ever played; the "Jacob's Ladder" influenced monster and environment design worked extremely well.

Negatives - Combat was pretty clunky, there were only like 5 enemies throughout the game, and much of the puzzles were contrived "Myst Wannabe" types or key-door hunts.

Spoilers ahead.



Story wise, I felt that the ending was more fulfilling than the first one (which I still don't understand) but it still was very confusing.

Does anyone have any summaries they'd like to share? I know that you killed your wife in a Kevorkian style manner to end her suffering, you had mixed feelings about it, and that Maria girl was some sort of mental representation of Mary... and that's about all I can figure out.

Was this version of Silent Hill a purgatory of sorts for people who had issues? The fat guy that you later wound up fighting - he had issues with his father and people picking on him (which was why you eventually found him in a room that looked like a meat locker filled with fat slabs of meat) and then the black haired girl was found in a room with cylinders poking in and out of the walls - some weird shit about molestation? 

And Laura was a friend of your wife's before she died (she was in the hospital as well?)

Weird stuff. :-)
