Just back from a short vacation in 'The Big Easy', aka
New Orleans.  Spent most the time visiting friends and
throughly enjoying the Cajun cuisine and music.  I don't
think I could ever have too much of that place, I've
already made plans to go back for Jazz Fest 2000.

But back to the coding front...  I'm starting to
research and design the sound system for the Tribes2
engine.  Under Windows we'll obviously be using
DirectSound, A3D and EAX. I'm a little new to sound
scene and gottchas on the Macintosh and Linux platforms.
If there is anyone out there with a few words of wisdom
concerning Macintosh SoundSprockets or the various sound
API's under Linux I'd like to hear from you
(rick.overman@dynamix.com).

I just finished up the terrain generation and texturing
editors for Tribes2.  Forget everything you knew about
making terrains in Tribes1, I started from scratch on
this one with MOD makers in mind. It's like Bryce custom
tuned for Tribes.  In engine, nice gui interface,
instant feedback.  Just takes a few seconds to generate
something truly amazing.
