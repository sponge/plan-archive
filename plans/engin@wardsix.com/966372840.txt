Now how come I've never thought of this before?

The re-thinking of the engine has started, as it happens with most projects. I was sort of expecting this...

For A.I., I've got some cool ideas in mind, and as far as I can tell, I've been watching "2001" and "2010", then whole Alien series and Matrix, again and again and again. There is something underlying them all, something hidden which we do not see, which makes it all happen. That's what I'll try to mimic. That's what I will try to give birth to.

That thing is "intelligence", not just some "bullet time" :)
