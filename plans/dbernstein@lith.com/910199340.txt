So here we were, at the Computer Game Developers' Conference, at the Microsoft booth, demoing the Shogo music. All day long we had the same conversation on the showroom floor - 

"Hey, is that CD Audio?"

"No, it's DirectMusic."

"Really? So is it Digital Audio?"

"No, it's actually interactive MIDI with Downloadable Sounds. Basically, the music gets constructed on the fly using our own custom instruments."

"You're kidding."

"No. Listen. Here I go into this room, and when I shatter this window and the alarm goes off, the music starts building."

Next, Guy and I show how the music in "Informant" starts building seamlessly as soon as I blow open a window with a shotgun in the game.



"This is amazing."

Thanks for all of the folks that came to listen to our demo. Thanks to Sascha Dikiciyan from Sonic Mayhem, Bobby Prince, Tom White and others for their input. 

The time of static MIDI or CD-Audio soundtracks in games is over. At Microsoft's DirectX event after CGDC we pronounced General MIDI dead. 

A Shogo player will have a similar interactive experience as when he or she is enjoying a movie soundtrack - it builds with the action, following your every move, responding musically and seamlessly. 

See you at E3!
