Whatever.

My last .plan update (it's been awhile) led with congrats to Monolith.  Well, guess what.  They need it again.  
2 more games, gold!  Congrats, Jason and the whole crew out there.  I hope they 'go gold' again this XMAS!

ECTS was great for us... and we'll be looking to 'go gold' again very soon with Railroad Tycoon 2.  Any of you 
who have downloaded this demo know this is a seriously kick ass strategy game.  We can't wait... looks like the 
initial shipment of this one (counting Europe, which is in a feeding frenzy over it) will put it at AAA status from
the get go.  Look for it in mass quantities the last week of October.  FLY! is also progressing quite well and should
still be in stores in time to tuck it under the XMAS tree.

More great Gathering news to come... (I mean really great news)

Stay tuned.

Mike

Oh, yeah.  Go buy Jazz Jackrabbit2!
