2 games going gold this week... FLY! and Darkstone.  Big week at the church.  

We have a side project of the non-commercial, prototype variety that we need to build
a library of 3DStudio models for asap.  Buildings mostly, but characters/vehicles/items
would also be quite welcome.  I can't say too much about what we'd be using these for
just yet, but I can assure you that any models we use for the prototype may become part
of a major project than means money and credit for the modelers.  Please only send stuff
you own the rights to.

Submit questions (not about what we're doing with these) and models to: info@godgames.com
