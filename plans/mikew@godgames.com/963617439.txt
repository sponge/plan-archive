*** Gathering of Developer Finger Server

Have I mentioned lately that we are looking for teams?  ;)

Gathering is looking for more great teams/projects, and so is our new ODI label (www.odigames.com). 

For those that heard about ODI, and think 'Headgames' or some other shovelware label... stay tuned and see just how different/cool ODI is going to be.  You'll see that it's going to be the path to righteousness for a whole new generation of up and coming developers.  MOD MAKERS THAT ARE READY TO DO A COMMERCIAL GAME... CHECK IT OUT.

Please check out the submissions section of our website.  

if you are an individual, and not a team, you might also check out our jobs section, as many gathering-related teams are looking for new team members.
