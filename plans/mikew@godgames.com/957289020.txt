There is a very cool cover story on PopTop's Tropico in this month's Computer Games mag.  We haven't released alot fo info on this game up to now, but Phil and the gang will be showing this sweet thang in its full glory at E3.  Check it out if you haven't... www.poptop.com

BTW... PopTop's "old game", Railroad Tycoon 2, resurfaced on the top 10 charts at number 7 this week, after being out for a little more than 18 months.  Nice when a great game does well on those freaking charts.
