MAN, what a weekend, or at least a Sunday!  KPC goes gold, and them a gang of godsters gets to go to the Metallica/Kid Rock/Korn/Powerman 5000 concert at TX Stadium.  This was a 'special' one... since James Hetfield is in the hospital with a back injury(?), he wasn't able to perform.  

But it turned out to be such a cool thing... not only are Metallica coming back to play another show for free when Hetfield recovers, but we got to see a whole Metallica set with Korn, Kid Rock, and the other bands jamming w/them and taking vocals.  Kid Rock singing Sad But True and Nothing Else Matters with Metallica at TX Stadium... strange indeed, but very cool.  Excellent move(s) by Metallica and the others, making a crap situation a memorable experience, and telling us to keep our ticket stubs for a free show next month. 

Some game developers (and publishers) could learn something from these guys in terms of fan support...

Anyhow, it was awesome.

ALSO:

Gathering is looking for more great teams/projects, and so is our new ODI label (www.odigames.com). 

For those that heard about ODI, and think 'Headgames' or some other shovelware label... stay tuned and see just how different/cool ODI is going to be.  You'll see that it's going to be the path to righteousness for a whole new generation of up and coming developers.  MOD MAKERS THAT ARE READY TO DO A COMMERCIAL GAME... CHECK IT OUT.

Please check out the submissions section of our website.  

if you are an individual, and not a team, you might also check out our jobs section, as many gathering-related teams are looking for new team members.
