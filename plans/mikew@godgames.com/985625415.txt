No project.
Plan:
Erik from Old Man Murray wrote me this morning, suggesting I update my .plan with the following info.  I forgot I even had a .plan. ;)

Subj: Not to tell you your job or anything


Text: "But you should update your plan to mention that Serious Sam is 
selling for 14.99 this week at Best Buy.  That's the greatest deal in 
the history of gaming.  I could actually make a case that that's 
cheaper than pirating it. "



There you have it, folks.  Congrats to CroTeam for under-promising and over-delivering.  That's how another small independent developer of high end shooters got it's start, I think. 


No public key.
