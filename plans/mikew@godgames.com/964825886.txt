In regards to the Gameweek Apple story.

I'd like to clarify something... Apple was upset with these comments due to the fact that their developer relations people have been doing a good job w/our Mac-friendly developers.  My comments about lack of support were solely geared toward publisher/marketing related support.  I'm mostly disappointed that their marketing direction has nothing to do with gaming.  As evidenced by Jobs keynote spending about 5 minutes on 'gaming' (just saying that Microsoft's games were coming to the Mac) and spending about 45 minutes explaining how they believe the future is everyone editing their own movies.
