Just to clarify the info being posted on The Gathering's presence at the upcoming Ground Zero 
event in NYC... we'll have a couple of guys there giving demos and letting visitors play 
Nocturne and Darkstone.  The other games we'll be showing will be shown only on video... new,
cool ECTS videos for the most part.  That includes Age of Wonders, KISS Psycho Circus:The 
Nightmare Child, Heavy Metal:FAKK2, RUNE, and Max Payne.

Playable demos off all these games will be given by the developers at ECTS... except Max Payne.
The 3DRealms/Remedy boys continue to sit out trade shows to try to make uninterrupted progress
on getting Duke Forever and Max Payne to the level that they want them for 2000.  I don't think
you'll see live demos of either of those games until E3 2000, but on 3DRealms knows for sure.
