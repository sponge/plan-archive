No project.
Plan:
Loonyboi threw this in:

How about mentioning the fact that Serious Sam is seriously impossible to 
find around the country? We've been getting tons of mails from people that 
were told their local software store underordered on the game and it sold 
out within minutes.

Congrats. That's the best problem you can have in this industry. :)

BTW, Our sales guys say that EB is still pretty well stocked and getting more in today, if you're having a tough time finding it.  Please resist any temptation to pirate the game if you're having a tough time finding it.  CroTeam deserves to make some money on this game.

Erik from Old Man Murray wrote me this morning, suggesting I update my .plan with the following info.  I forgot I even had a .plan. ;)

Subj: Not to tell you your job or anything


Text: "But you should update your plan to mention that Serious Sam is 
selling for 14.99 this week at Best Buy.  That's the greatest deal in 
the history of gaming.  I could actually make a case that that's 
cheaper than pirating it. "


There you have it, folks.  Congrats to CroTeam for under-promising and over-delivering.  That's how another small independent developer of high end shooters got it's start, I think. 


No public key.
