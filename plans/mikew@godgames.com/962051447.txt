incite is gone... that sucks.  that was a cool mag.  that and pcxl shutting down sadly tell the tale of our little closet culture not integrating well with the mainstream.  trying to making gaming cool/fashionable to 'regular' folks is hard work.

in other news, i was able to escape ion storm's kidnapping clutches and haul ass back over to the church, where i have been granted sanctuary.  i can't say exactly what noel and the boys wanted w/me over there, but let's just say that microsoft isn't the only company who has thought about invading the console hardware market.  beware the bitch-box.
