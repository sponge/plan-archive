Just to clarify about the 'trailer' including Vampire footage floating around
on the net lately..

This video was taken from a Siggraph promotional thing that the folks at
Alias|Wavefront shot quite a long time ago.  It wasn't intended as a PR
trailer for Vampire or anything.  It was originally part of a multi-part set
of loops that were used at the SGI booth at Siggraph, the other ones showing
various effects houses and stuff using Maya.

We did the trailer because we use Maya and we think its awesome for games,
not because they paid us for it in any way.  Well, I think they might have
bought lunch that day.. :) 

Most of the game footage in the video is pretty outdated now, even thought
the video just started making the rounds on the net (it was shown at Siggraph
and released on a Maya demo CD quite a while back).

Last we heard, the folks at Activision are working on a 'real' trailer for 
the game based on a mucn more recent build for release to the net soon. So
if you're looking for more up-to-date, game-focused footage, keep a lookout
for it.
