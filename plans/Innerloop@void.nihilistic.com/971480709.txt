Rapid fire topics here:

- The technology staff would like to officially welcome on-board Brandon 
Moro who is embarking on his first commerical game project and just flew 
in from Florida where he worked on a type of software that sounds so 
boring I hesitate to mention it here.  But his skills will be well 
utilized in helping whip our tools and art paths into shape in addition to 
general engine coding.  Brandon becomes Nihilistic's lucky 13th employee, 
and our final new addition will be starting soon, but I'll leave that 
announcement for another department.

- Nihilistic is moving to new digs and will be "offline" for a couple days
worst-case.  We're moving to a larger space just down the road, but there 
are always hassles with phone and T1 connections, so bear with us.

- For those attending the Australian Game Developer's Conference in 
November, I'll be attending that event and giving a run-down of our Maya 
art path and engine integration and some tidbits about our current 
projects, and I'll also be participating in a panel with other cool developers
like (game gods!) Alex Garden and Robin Walker.  Couple that with the fun of 
visited Australia for the first time, it should be a fun trip...

- For the record, the blue team has it all over the red team.
