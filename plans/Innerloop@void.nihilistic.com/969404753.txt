Hi there.  Still not time to release word on Nihilistic's next project, 
but there are a few other things I'd like talk about.

First off, since the GD postmortem I've gotten a lot of email about how we 
integrated the Java stuff into our engine, and I replied to the first few 
and then got burnt out typing the same thing all the time, so if I haven't 
replied to a question along those lines, its because I've decided to 
writeup an article about it in more detail for Gamasutra, so assuming its 
good enough (and assuming I finish it soon), it should show up 
there eventually.

Also, if there are other folks out there who have done interesting things 
with scripting language (Java, LUA, roll-your-own, etc.) I'm trying to 
organize a panel discussion for GDC2001 on this very important (but often 
overlooked) topic.  So if you have an interesting war story to tell about 
scripting languages in a commercial title (positive or negative) email me 
at innerloop@nihilistic.com so we can pull together and share that info.

Along similar lines, I'd like to encourage anyone in the biz to check out 
the GDC 2001 submissions page, its that time of year again and we're 
anxious to get some great submissions and hopefully a lot of first-time 
speakers this year to keep things fresh.  The suggested topics should give 
some idea of where the conference is headed next year.  The page is at 
http://www.gdconf.com/speakers

The next conf isn't until March 2001, but the submission deadline ends in 
less than a month.

Thanks.  I promise the next update will contain some actual info about 
Nihilistic and our next project (maybe..)
