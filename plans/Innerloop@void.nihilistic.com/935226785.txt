Gameplay Technician (yes, we just made that up..)
 
Nihilistic is looking for a driven and creative individual to join the 
Vampire team as a Gameplay Technician. The role involves working with 
the game's scripting language and data resources to create the coolest 
gameplay possible. This is where the "rubber meets the road" in terms 
of gameplay sequencing, scripting, combat and Discipline effects, etc.
Also involves some level design, object placement, and AI tuning work. 

We're looking for someone that will go nuts with the dark toy-box of 
capabilities the Nod Engine offers and help to bring Vampire to a 
never-before-seen level of interactivity and fun. If you are located 
in the Bay Area, have some basic experience in programming C or Java, 
love games, and are enthusiastic about having a key role on a major 
entertainment title, then we'd like to talk to you!
 
Please, Bay Area residents (that can commute to Novato) only should apply. 
A history of work experience in the gaming industry is a plus, but not 
required.

This is currently a full-time, temporary position, but could lead to 
continued employment if your work rocks and you don't piss us off too 
much. :)
