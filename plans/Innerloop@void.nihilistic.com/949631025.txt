Ok, I finally figured out a great new use for .plan files - a place to post
some of the more amusing bugs that come up during the final stages of a game's
development..

Here's one to kick things off:

From: ATVI_Test
To: Bugs
Subject: BUG: Willie hates the Smithy's horse when he is on Offensive mode

When we walked by the Smithy's shop, Willie began attacking the horse when he 
was in offensive mode.  Willie began firing his bow at the horse as well as 
using the awe discipline.  When I switched to Willie and put Cristof in 
attack mode, he began to cast disciplines on the horse as well.


Other good subject lines (body text removed to protect the innocent coders!)

BUG: Joining a game that doesn't exist will cause the client to go out of synch
BUG: Disloyal Servants (a Fox Special "When Summoned Pets Go Bad!")
BUG: Dead Man Walking
BUG: Christof can walk through a wall of wooden beams
BUG: Discipline Summon Elemental  will kill your party members and maybe even you!

Ok, I'm starting to think maybe these are only funny to me...
