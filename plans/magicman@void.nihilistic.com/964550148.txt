Level Design Position

Now that Vampire is out the door, Nihilistic is beginning to look 
ahead at what's coming next. We'd like to hire two more level 
designers to join our team for the next project.

Nihilistic is a small company that focuses on one solid title at a
time. We believe in hiring creative, hard-working, dedicated and 
talented people and letting them do their job.  The position is a 
full-time on-site spot in the San Francisco Bay Area. We offer 
competitive salaries, full benefits, and profit sharing.

Applicants should:

1) be willing to relocate to the Bay Area
2) be willing to work closely with a small group of people in an open
environment
3) be experienced building levels in a 3D game world
4) have samples we can actually run through and look at (either via
add-ons to games on the market - Vampire, the Quake series, the Unreal 
series, Jedi Knight, Half-Life, etc - or by pointing to examples in 
commercial products)
5) be ready to work hard in a fun and relaxed atmosphere

Strong pluses but not necessarily requirements:

1) familiarity with CSG-based or brush-based editing tools (like
QERadiant or WorldCraft)
2) background in programming or some degree of confidence in 
programming concepts
3) background in skills less directly related to level design - 3D 
modeling, 2D texture art, scripting

If you're interested and want to show off what you can do, email
your resume, using "Level Design Position" as the subject, to this 
address:

Or send your resume and samples of your work to this postal address:

internship positions available.

Nihilistic Software, Inc. is an equal opportunity employer.

Note: submissions WILL NOT be returned.

If you've sent an application recently (within the last few weeks), 
there's no need to resubmit it. 

Thanks.
