Level Design Opening

Nihilistic Software is continuing work on our next project, an 
action/adventure next generation console title. We'd like to fill out 
our level design team with one more motivated individual. We're a small 
company that focuses on one solid title at a time. We believe in hiring 
creative, hard-working, dedicated, talented people and letting them do 
their job. The position is a full-time on-site spot in the San Francisco 
Bay Area. We offer competitive salaries, full benefits, and profit sharing.
 
Applicants should:

* be willing to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area
* be willing to work closely with a small group of people in an open environment
* be experienced building levels in a 3D game world
* have a strong sense of artistic design and gameplay
* have interest in and experience with gameplay on videogame console systems
* have samples we can run through and look at (via user-made add-ons or 
professional work in a commercial product)
* be ready to work hard in a fun and relaxed atmosphere

Strong pluses but not necessarily requirements:

* ability to model both indoor and outdoor environments
* familiarity with and knowledge of higher-level modeling software (Maya, 3DSMax, etc)
* familiarity with CSG-based or brush-based editing tools (like QERadiant or WorldCraft)
* background in programming or some level of confidence in programming concepts
* background in skills less directly related to level design - 2D texture art, scripting, etc
