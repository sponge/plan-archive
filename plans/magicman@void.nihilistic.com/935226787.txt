Can't wait for Quake3? Tired of midair railing 5 of your friends
simultaneously? Need something fresh and exciting to occupy the
time between refreshing your ftp sites checking for Q3:Arena? 
Well, I have the answer for ya...a brand spanking new Quake DM 
level. 

Ok, it's not exactly brand new, but it's new to Quake. My second 
level converted from Quake2 to Quake, The Frag Pipe.

Get it here: 

ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/levels/deathmatch/p-r/q1_q2dm3.zip


And, in case you haven't seen it, my first conversion to Quake, 
The Edge (released about 4 months ago), can be found in that 
same directory:

ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/levels/deathmatch/p-r/q1_q2dm1.zip


Enjoy.
