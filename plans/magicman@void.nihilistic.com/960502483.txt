It's nice to see a design decision work out basically how we intended 
it to. From the beginning, Ray and the rest of us have wanted the end 
users to be able to take levels that we ship with the game and reuse 
them in new chronicles of their own making.

We have one file that tells the game all of the locations available 
for this particular chronicle and handles all the connections from 
level to level (which exit will take you to which entrance on another 
level). We call this our chronicle file (go figure). There is nothing 
in the levels themselves that specifies which level you will get taken 
to when you walk through this door or into this tunnel. 

What this all means is that it's very easy for you to take a few of our 
levels, create a new chronicle file (very simple text file), write a 
few scripts if you want, and create a brand new chronicle you and your
buddies can play through. You can make it as complex or as simple as 
you want (many Storytellers may not want scripts to handle any of the 
events or conversations and simply play them all out like you would 
around a table - in which case, creating a brand new chronicle couldn't 
be easier).

Within a few hours of receiving the first multiplayer chronicle design 
doc from Ray, I had the chronicle file and scripts written. The next 
day we were using it to test some Storyteller capabilities (note: 
dropping a taxi cab and a parking meter in the middle of Twelfth 
Century Prague is a sure way to confuse the players).
