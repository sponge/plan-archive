Nihilistic is still considering hiring another level designer.
So, all you mapping freaks out there should put together a couple
of your best maps (from any 3D game really...Quake, Hexen2, 
Jedi, etc.) and send them to jobs@nihilistic.com - just make 
sure the subject line says something about level design.

Speaking of maps, I actually took time a couple weekends ago to
make a Quake2 DM map. I wanted something small and fast paced
to try and give Quake2 DM the feeling you get in Quake. I don't
think it's possible, but the map is available anyway.

...oh, and Charlie...I heard rumors that Ion hired all those women.
