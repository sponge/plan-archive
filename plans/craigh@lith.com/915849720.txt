I just read Geoff Keighley's interview with Justin Chin on GameSpot and choked on this question (and not because of the dubious grammar):

"GSN: Half-Life received rave reviews from players because it infused the typical 3D action game with emotional hooks such as characters, suspense, and a story that developed from within the game engine. Now that Half-Life has ignited the wick, are you going to follow in its footsteps and emulate the same formula?"

Perhaps Mr. Keighley needs to go back and play Dark Forces and Jedi Knight again. Both games feature strong narrative structures, protagonists with clear motives and personalities, well developed villains, and major plot reversals. Half-Life is an awesome game that sets new standards in interactivity, atmosphere, and overall polish, but by design it doesn't have much in the way of actual plot.

In any case, to suggest that incorporating "characters, suspense, and a story" into a 3D action game is emulating Half-Life's formula is insulting and naive. Suggesting it to Justin Chin is just plain outrageous.

Half-Life deserves plenty of praise for its sheer excellence, but let's not get carried away. That kind of impertinent overstatement belongs on a rabid fan page, not a respectable gaming site.
