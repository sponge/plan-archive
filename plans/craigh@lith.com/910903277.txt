First off, happy Veterans Day to all the veterans out there! :)

Secondly, congratulations to Valve! I've been jonesing for Half-Life since I first saw it at E3 back in 1997.

This is definitely going to be an incredible holiday season for gamers! Perhaps the best ever. I'm going to be buying myself a lot of presents! :)
