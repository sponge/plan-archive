SHOGO:

Just a quick update to thank everyone for all the excellent feedback we've received. We're eager to learn and improve with every game we do, and all the compliments, criticism, concerns, suggestions, and flames give us useful insight into what worked and what didn't. Thanks for taking the time to tell us what you think!

Also, if you're experiencing issues with getting killed during cinematics with the alpha patch, don't worry! The AI fixes required some level tweaks that will be in the final patch. :)

NOT SHOGO:

Metal Gear: Solid is a true masterpiece. One of the richest, most satisfying games I've ever played. I could go on and on how incredible it is, but Brandon Reinhart already did such a great job (check out his 10/29 plan update).

Speaking of rich, satisfying games, Grim Fandango absolutely rules! It's beautiful, compelling, challenging, funny, and thoroughly entertaining. Awesome game. :)
