SHOGO

We've had a number of requests for a continuity guide for the Shogo universe for the purposes of level design, MODs, and fiction, so I'm going to update the backstory document and hand it over to Jeremy.

I must say it's very cool that people are into the game universe enough to want to work within it. :)

NOT SHOGO

Self evident comments about recent games:

Half-Life is awesome. It's just so damn convincing. I also love how situational it is--you progress from challenge to challenge rather than from monster to monster. Incredible attention to detail, great sound design, cool effects, excellent writing, solid voice acting, nice models, and superb level design.

Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the coolest game I've ever played. A true masterpiece. I never want it to end. :)
