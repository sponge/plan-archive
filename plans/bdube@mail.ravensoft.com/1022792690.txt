  So, whats happening in the world of Sof2 multiplayer you ask?  Well, hopefully this 
  will answer that question. First we would like to address some of the bigger known 
  issues that Raven is actively trying to resolve.  These are by no means the only issues 
  we are looking at, but instead the larger issues.  When a patch is released a full 
  list of changes made will be released along with it as well as updated mod source.

  * INVALID_CDKEY
    It seems that some people are having issues playing online due to this message.  We 
    are actively looking into this problem and ask that anyone who receives this 
    problem send us and email at sof2mp@ravensoft.com with their ip address and the time
    of day that it occurred.  With that info we can try to figure out why your cdkey is 
    being listed as invalid.

  * Linux RMG Issues
    We are narrowing down on this issue and hope to have it resolved soon.

  * Demo Recording
    Seems that you cannot play back a recorded demo right now, this is also top on the 
    list of things to resolve.

  * BAN LIMITATIONS
    The current banning system has a few flaws which is making it hard to admin friendly 
    fire servers.  We are currently working on improving this system.

  * CHEAT PROTECTION
    Raven will soon be taking measures to help keep sof2 as cheat free as possible, more 
    information on this to come.


  Along with bug fixes we will also be adding some new content as well.  This content will 
  include the demolition (someone set us up the bomb) gametype which is a nice alternative 
  to infiltration and allow servers to change it up a bit.  Along with this gametype we
  will also be including a few new Raven made maps, at least one which will support the new
  demolition gametype.  This is the first installment of new content for Sof2 multiplayer
  from Raven and im sure will be a welcome addition.

  As if that werent enough we are also working on integrated voice communications.  This
  should make the process of using  voice communication in sof2 a much easier process.  More
  details will be released on this when its becomes available for  use.

  One more thing that will be added is a MODS menu which will list the installed mods and
  allow for easy transition to them.

  Last I would like to mention the forums and the bug report email address that have been
  set up.  We are actively reading  the forums, responding to issues, and writing down
  suggestions for improvements as well as supporing the quickly growing  mod community.  The
  email address (which i mentioned previously) has been setup as a way to send bug reports
  for multiplayer to us.
