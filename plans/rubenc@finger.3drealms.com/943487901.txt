Every now and then my friends and I here at 3Drealms get calls from 
people who are trying to break into the PC gaming industry.  
These are people who have no "professional experience" which in 
most cases get passed aside when competing for positions in high 
profile companies.  In this industries there are ways to get in even if 
you do not have the  professional experience companies are looking 
for.   When you buy a PC game, one selling factor that has become 
popular is being able to create modifications to that game.  The 
explosion of user modified games have created an internet 
community pumping out everything from meshes, textures, levels, and 
mods for most popular games for people to download and use.  There 
are hundreds of user gaming sites that will take what ever you create 
for these games so that it can be downloaded by others.  Some of 
these mods can become very popular making what started out to be a 
fun project, a  career.   These high profile companies do download 
these modifications some times with the intent of looking for some 
new talent.  You should still send out your VHS tapes but if your 
looking for an edge create work for some of these games.  You 
almost have too if you want to become a level designer.  Here at 
3Drealms you have to produce at least a good map from today's 
popular games to even be considered for the position.  When you do 
these modifications it shows companies that you have an 
understanding of the mechanics and processes to create game user 
material.  These are the same qualities that the professionals have 
that are so attractive.  Lets face it what better advertisement can there 
be for your work  if its being used and played by hundreds of people.  
So if your a modeler, create some models for your favorite game. If 
your a texture artists create texture sets and so on.........    Oh,  Duke 
Nukem Forever will be very customizable!!!!! :)
