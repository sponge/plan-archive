MULLET HAIKUS 

Shampoo stings my eyes, 
I will never feel that twice: 
slick hair smells like gas. 


O! SQUIRREL brother, 
Your tail, my hair. We are one. 
Yet I must eat you. 


I liked that foreign 
legion movie so much, I 
grew me one them hats. 


Brown edged tank top sticks 
to my white clumpy armpits 
Somehow I get laid. 


Flowing down the back 
helps to keep mind closed, hate 
released by short top 

My hair is slammin 
like Stone Cold. Can I get a Hell 
yeah? Hell yeah. Hell yeah. 


This super cool hair 
and a bucket of chicken: 
What more could I want? 


my slick snakeskin boots 
my silk shirt with rooster prints 
always colored jeans 


Lynnrd Skynnrd didn't 
win no spelling bees. Who cares? 
They rock the trailer. 


Razor set to one. 
Do front and sides and then stop 
Reaffirm my style. 


Metallica is 
or first graders. Nothing rocks 
harder than Winger. 


Dogs urinate where 
they so choose. And so do I. 
Red and blue lights flash. 


Teen runaway, I 
hate my dad. Yet I am one. 
Fly, thunderbird, fly. 


Ponytails are for wimps. 
But if you let that hair loose, 
you are my brother. 


New white tank top tucks 
neatly into tight black jeans: 
redneck romeo. 


Short like your schooling. 
Long like your prison sentence. 
The penal haircut. 


Bald on the top and 
long on the back. Behold my 
glorious skullet. 


You smoke me up and 
jerk me off. You are the best, 
and I love you, sis. 


My mullet and me 
like to climb up a tree. We're 
the best friends that could be. 


Dad likes my mullet. 
The nurse calls it a critter 
carpet. My head breeds. 


With long hair in place 
how else can I rebel? Hand 
me the bong uncle. 


Under the Christmas 
tree: tight black jeans and a comb. 
I've been extra good! 


Short for dad. Long for 
the daughter mom always wanted. 
Everyone's happy.
