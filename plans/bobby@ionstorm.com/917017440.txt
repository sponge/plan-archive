Just saw the brand new Anachronox trailer, and all i can 
say is "OH MY GOD!".  Talk about an amazing looking game!
A huge congrats to Tom Hall and the rest of the incredible
Anachronox team on an outstanding job so far.  Man, now I
REALLY can't wait to play Anachronox.

On the Daikatana work front, very close to having E1M5 wrapped
up.  Down to adding cool details, effects, sounds, etc.  Should
be able to have it done this weekend.

Got an email from a guy at Purdue University asking me if
they could use my Q2 DM map "Ad Mortem" for it.   Pretty cool.
So if you're in/around the Purdue area, might wanna check it
out.  The webpage with all the info is at 
http://www.cs.purdue.edu/quakefest.

That's all for now kiddies.  Until next time...

Even before I got the job here at ION, I thought that the gaming
community, and in particular, the gaming community web sites,
were evolving more and more into one big gossip ring.  When
the community first got started, you didn't see all the "news"
posts, and editorials, and gossip about who's doing what to whom
behind the scenes at Company X.  The community was more interested
in making and playing cool games.  Nowadays, however, it seems that
the gaming community is developing more and more into a political
and economical warzone, where the only thing anyone cares about is
how many "hits" their site is getting, or how many advertisers they
can lure to their site, or who they can "tear down" for whatever
personal vendetta they have.  It's disheartening to see what was once
such a pure, fun-loving community degrading into something so 
political.  I sincerely hope that the community can soon return to
the way it was in its early form, where people's focus was on making
and playing cool games and having a good time doing it.  

On that note, I just wanna say "KUDOS" to the entire 
PlanetQuake News staff.  Through all the recent anti-ION press, PQ is
the only site where I have not seen a single news post, article, or 
link on the PQ news page about any of it.  It's refreshing to see that 
there is still a news site that is actually more interested in news 
about games, rather than jumping on the bandwagon of posting gossip about
a game company.

As always, if you have any comments or responses to anything
I have said here, you are more than welcome to voice them to me via email
at bobby@ionstorm.com.  That's all for now kiddies.  Until next time...

Hmm, been a little while since I updated this .plan thingy.
Sorry bout that, but we been so busy churning away at getting
all these maps done, that I haven't had time to barely even
think, much less do .plan updates.  Speaking of work, I'm busy
putting the finishing touches on E1M5, should have it wrapped
up pretty soon.  Just want to say that Steve Rescoe did some
awesome stuff on E1.  The architecture is nothing short of
stunning, and the layout of the level is extremely intricate,
wrapping the level back around and over itself so that you 
recognize where you have been, and areas that you discover 
later in the level.  My only complaint would be that he might
not have been too concerned about r_speeds in a couple areas.
Nothing a few hint brushes and some very minor architecture
fixes couldn't knock down.  But overall, I think the E1 levels
are some of the best levels I have seen yet. 

For those of you who have been asking about the tutorial about
making terrain using the "triangle method" that I promised to do,
just want to let you guys know that I am working on it right now,
and hope to have it done by this weekend.  As soon as it's done,
I'll send it on over to Fishman at RUST, so he can post it for 
everyone to see.

I enjoyed the Daiaktana Cabana Chat last night.  I wanna say
"Thanks" to all the people who came out and showed support, and 
brought some great questions about Daikatana to the chat.  
And, in case you haven't heard, we released a couple new screen-
shots during the chat last night.  You can check them out over
at www.stormtroopers.com.  The 2nd shot is some of the work
in E2M1, from yours truly.  If you have any comments/suggestions
about the shot, feel free to drop me a line and let me know what
ya think.  I love to hear feedback from the community.  After all,
you guys are the ones we are making the game for.

Anyways, time to get back to some mappin'.  That's it for now
kiddies.  Until next time...

It never ceases to amaze me how spoiled SOME of the people
who work in this industry are.  People complaining about
work conditions, especially people who have worked here at
Ion, is ridiculous.  Try a job in the "real world", where 
you have to be in every day at 8 AM to a job that you hate,
where you're underpaid and overworked, and have a boss who 
doesn't give a flying f**k (pardon my french) whether you 
work there another day or not, and then cry to me about how 
"horrible" the working conditions are in the gaming biz.  
Gimme a break.  Then you got those people who get let go from 
their job, and instead of retaining some dignity and integrity, 
they go crying to whomever will listen to them about how they 
were "mistreated", and throw blatantly false accusations at 
their former employers, in an effort to make themselves feel 
a little better, like they got some sort of "revenge".  
Gimme a break.  Be a man about it. People get fired everyday,
even wrongly fired - it happens - get over it.  But you don't
see Microsoft employees who get fired, running to all the news
sites, slandering Bill Gates and Microsoft, crying about how
they were "terribly mistreated".  My guess is most of these 
cry babies are people who can't land a job elsewhere in the 
biz, so they wanna point fingers at other people, trying to 
make people believe it wasn't their fault they got fired, 
in hopes that maybe someone will feel pity for them, and 
hire them even though their work may not be good enough.  
Pathetic.  Absolutely pathetic.  I'm curious to hear what 
people in the community think about this subject?  If you 
wanna share your opinion, feel free to drop me an email about 
it.  I'd like to see what you guys out there have to say.

Anyways, enough ranting from me.  It's a new year, and an 
exciting one to be sure. LOTSA cool releases coming out in
'99, 3 of 'em right here from Ion :)  On top of that you
got Q3A, UT, Duke Forever, TF2, and a slew of other great
games that I can't wait to see.  Oh yeah, don't forget to
check out Dawn of Darkness, by Ward Six.  It's an add-on, but
it's gonna rock!

On a work-related note, everyone is back from the holidays.  
Everyone is refreshed, excited, and ready to kick some serious
booty on Daikatana.  And with Chris Klie now here to lead us 
level designers down the home stretch, it should be a very 
productive next couple months.  Got back to working on E2M1
today, and have gotten to a point where the remainder of the
level should progress pretty fast.  So I'm hoping to wrap this
baby up soon, and get cracking on polishing up Matt Hooper's 
awesome Epidose 3 (Dark Ages) maps.  Can't wait to get my hands
on those babies :)

That's it for now kiddies.  Until nest time...

	Ugh.  "ERROR:  Floatplane: Bad Normal"  This error
really sucks.  I have run into this little bugger too many
times while editing.  It usually pops up when you're doing
alot of clipping or carving, especially with odd-shaped
brushes, like those you might be working with when making
an outdoor area.  I have found that what usually happens is
a brush is generated that is too thin to be visible (most of
the time), thus you can't simply find it in the editor and 
delete it, and bsp can't compile it.  So you're either
stuck going through and rebuilding (hope you been saving your
map in increments), or you can go through your map and highlight
all the visible brushes, and then copy and paste them into 
a new map.  But this can be an ENORMOUS pain when your map 
starts getting large.  That's exactly what I had to do today,
and my map is already over 1000 brushes, so you can imagine
how much fun it was.  Unfortunately, Larry Herring, our local
level-design error guru, wasn't here today to give me a quick-fix
for this problem, if there even is one.  If any of you guys
know an easier way to fix the "Floatplane: Bad Normal"  error,
by all means share it with me.  Just because I work here doesn't
mean I know everything there is to learn about level design.
I'm still learning new things every day.

	For those of you who have written asking for more
details about the triangle method for making terrain that I
mentioned in my .plan a few days ago, I am going to "try" to put 
together a little tutorial type dealie over the holidays 
explaining it more fully,  including pics so you can see exactly
what I'm talking about.  It's really simple once you can see how
to do it.  Once I have it finished, I'll prolly give it to Fishman
so he can post it over at Rust for everyone to look at.

Dunno if I'll get a chance to do any more .plan updates before 
I leave for the holidays, so just in case, I hope everyone has a
wonderful Christmas and a Happy (and safe) New Years.  Personally,
I'm hoping to make it to New Orleans to watch my Texas A&M Aggies
beat the hell outta Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl.  It'll be a tough
game, but we managed to top Kansas State, so who knows.  Either way
though, I'm sure New Years on Bourbon Street will be a blast.  Guess
that's about it for now kiddies.  Until next time...

	Triangles are cool.  Ever wonder how level 
designers make the ground all uneven in an outdoor area,
but still have it look smooth?  Triangles.  Lotsa triangles.
The good thing about triangles is that you can vertex
manipulate without screwing up a face.  If you try vertex
manip with a rectangular brush, you can run into problems.
And you can use them for more than just ground.  If you're
building the interior of a cave or something, you can give
the floor and the walls of the cave an uneven, but very
natural look using triangles and vertex manipulating.  They
just plain rock I tell you! (no pun intended)  I used to 
hate doing outdoor areas, but with the simple techniques 
I have picked up since I started working here, outdoor 
areas are every bit as simple, if not more so, than indoors.

	On a non-work related note...  Had to smack Romero
down in Doom2 yet again tonight.  I thought about letting
him win since he treated me and KC to Bennihana's for dinner
(kick ass place to eat, BTW), but I just couldn't bring 
myself to do it.  So I beat him down some on map 1, and 
then he made the mistake of agreeing to play me on one of 
my old DM wads.  Let's just say it wasn't pretty.  Then Joey
wanted some of the action, so I handed him 3 beatings in a
row.  The last game was a marathon - 700 frags on map 1.
Definitely the longest DM I have ever played.

	Lastly, for those of you who live in the Dallas
area, I could use some help.  I am going to be looking to
move here in the next couple months, and being new to the
area, I could use some advice where to look.  I am currently
in an apartment in Deep Ellum.  Real nice complex, but it's
not the best of areas.  I'm looking for a decent apartment
in a part of town where I wouldn't be afraid to walk around
at night, preferrably under $600/month.  So if any of you 
have any suggestions, send them my way.  That's it for now
kiddies.  Until next time...

	Well, the X-mas party was pretty cool.  The whole
crew from Austin made the trip up and we all partied down
in the Sky Lobby here at the Chase Tower in downtown.
Lotsa good music, GREAT food, and all the free alcohol you
could consume.  Sound like a good time or what?

	Took the girlfriend to see a movie tonight.  Saw 
"Enemy of the State" with Will Smith and Gene Hackman.
I have to say this movie was pretty damn good.  Lotsa
action and suspense and a killer finale at the end.  I'd
definitely recommend it to you movie-buffs.  Probably
won't win any oscars, but worth a night out.  It even has
the badass Star Wars prequel trailer in the previews, which
I'm sure we have all seen 1000 times by now.

	On the work front, still progressing on E2M1.  Had
a nice little battle with some r_speeds issues today.  But
nothing a few strategically placed hint brushes couldn't
solve.  Hint brushes just plain rule!  They let you do alot
more than you would think in the Q2 engine.  

	That's if for now kiddies.  Until next time...

	Ahh, another late night of making levels for
Daikatana.  It wouldn't be so bad if Romero didn't insist
on going through his entire collection of 80's hard rock
bands.  You know, the really cheesy ones with the HUGE 
hair-dos, like Winger, Poison, Judas Priest, etc.  
Oh well, just have to turn up the .mp3's a little louder
to drown out that mess.

	Progress on E2M1 is coming along nicely.  making 
the switch from Worldcraft to Radiant wasn't as bad as I
thought it would be.  I was up to speed in a couple days.
I still think WC has the superior GUI, but Radiant has 
more features, especially with all the added goodies we
have in our version for DK.  So I guess it's a trade-off.
I would still recommend WC though for the beginning 
designer.  It's what I started with, and the built-in
tutorial included in WC had me editing my first Quake maps
in no time.

	T-19 hours and counting until the annual Ion
Storm Christmas party.  Should be alot of fun.  We get off
work early (for a change) and then get to party all night
in the sky lobby here at the Chase Tower with free food, 
and more importantly, FREE BEER!  Mmmmm, beer is good! :)
Doh!  Gotta go.  I'm late for my AA meeting.  Til
next time....
