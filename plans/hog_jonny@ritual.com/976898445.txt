This message was in my e-mail box this morning.  Geez, and I thought I was a geek!?!

Hey Sean, just poking fun... 

-----------------

Keep us all updated on the Alli/Brooke situation.  Remember, there are
a lot of geeks out here.. most of us live vicariously from one cool
story like yours to the next.


Thanks!
Sean Reardon.

The Hero's Tale...

There is a couple of hotties that live in my apartment complex... college girls.  You gotta love em.

Sometimes it's nice being the 'computer guy'.

Alli calls my cell phone and leaves a message... "Jon, it's an emergency. My computer crashed, can you come over and fix it.  I had a paper due for my final today... I think I'm screwed."

Suddenly my mind starts to wander, I begin to think to myself "Maybe this is just a ploy to get me over to their apartment.  Yeah, they want me!"

I call over to their house, Alli is not there but Brooke answers.  "Hey Jon, Alli really needs your help.  Her computer is broken and she needs you to come over and save her final."  "Should I just come over?" I ask.  She replies, "Yeah, the doors open.  I'll be in the back waiting... I'll call and make sure Alli is back before you get here."

Sounds fishy to me.  I start to get a little excited.

I mossey over to their apartment.  I go inside, and that is when I start to feel a little bit bad.  

Turns out they were serious.  Alli is upset and crying like it is the end of the world or something, Brooke is comforting her.  How selfish could I be... thinking only of my needs, when this poor young student was suffering such torment at the hands of modern technology!

I look at the computer... it is dead!  "I'll give it a shot, no promises." I say.  I go to work, trying everything I can think of to get that damn thing up and running.  Meanwhile I am getting the works.  Non-stop attention for hours.  "Oh, you're so sweet to do this."  "You're the nicest guy." "etc..."  By this time several other friends had happened by.  Now I was really in the spot light.  I had to win this battle, I was determined.

I'm lapping it up of course, givin them the techno-speak "Well, your config file and win.com files are hosed."  "We're going to have to shut down and reinstall your operating system."  "What does that mean?  Will it fix it?" they ask.  I reply, "Well I might have to run scandisk and do a full surface scan on the hard drive to detect and repair any problems... it might fix it."  "Oh wow, sounds complicated." they say.  "Sure is, this might take some time." I suggest.

Sounds like the beginning to some cheese-ball threesome porno, eh!  I wish... but no luck!

Sorry to disappoint you all, but nothing much happened.  5 hours and 2 windows installs later I was frustrated, tired, and actionless.  The pep squad were bored watching TV on the couch, the pampering had ceased...  hope seemed to loom just out of reach.  "if only I could get this damn thing working." I thought to myself.  My head dropped to the keyboard, frustrated.

BEEP.

I look up.  The damned machine is booting!  "Bring it on..." I think to myself.
I fixed the computer and the OS, but the final was gone... missing... corrupted... whatever.  Things were not going well.  I luckily managed to restore bits and peices of the history file from lingering word temp files, about 75% of the paper was still there in sections.

Turns out I was the hero after all!  I may not have gotten much action, but they are taking me out for drinks later this week.  It's a start, I'll keep you all posted.

And the morale of the story is...  Geeks can get girls too, your skills are useful for more then just playing games.

Trust me, it all made for quite an interesting evening.

I went to my car last night and my entire SUV was covered in a sheet of ice.

1/4 to 1/2 inches thick.  It looked like I might be able to remove the entire thing in one peice and have a life sized ice replica of the HoG mobile.

They don't sell windsheild scrapers here in the south, so I had to chip it off with the hardest thing I could find in my car... an altoids box.
If that isn't the lamest thing I have ever heard then I don't know what is!  If I heard someone else say that I would think..."What a dumbass!  An altoids box."

Then we come to today...

So I went out to my car this morning and it was covered in a sheet of ice... NOT AGAIN!

This time my doors and locks were frozen shut.

I finally made it to work after having to following several texas idiots for several miles driving 30 mph side by side blocking the entire freeway.
This town gets a little ice and suddenly everyone is driving like they are high and paranoid... kind of like LevelLord acts all the time.

Screw you guys, I'm going home.

If anyone reads this damned plan file... We have a bunch of new guys here at Ritual.

I want to start a thread on value titles/budget titles.

What do the gamers think about these sort of games?

What types of games would gamers like to see in the under $30 range?

I personally would like to take a year and make an A quality title that will sell for $20-30.

Something short and sweet.  Not a ton of new technology, not the most innovative technology.
Just something really fun, that is done really well.  'Quality' and 'Fun' would be the focus.

Existing engine (not nocturne)... something suited more towards 'real' action.

8-12 month developement cycle.

10-20 hours of gameplay.

I want to know what people would really enjoy.  What would make you want to purchase and play this sort of game?

If anyone has any comment or ideas give me a holler at jon@ritual.com.

Blair Witch 3: The Elly Kedward Tale is pretty much done.  We are through the crunch, ready to put in the final touches then send it off to manufacturing.  IT should be on the shelves around Nov. 20th.

Just got back from E3.  Things went great.  An Awesome show.

It seams that people are really starting to get what the Blair Witch Project games are all about.  The Blair Witch phenomenon in and of itself is very unique.  It's dark, it's creepy, and it's spooky.
People love it.

The games are going to be very unique themselves.  Nobody has ever done anything like this before.  These titles are nothing like anyone would initially expect... if you like scarry horror games like Resident evil, then you will like the Blair Witch trilogy.

If you don't know much about the series of games give them a chance and check out the G.o.D., Blair Witch website.

http://www.godgames.com/games/blair/

Now some ranting about e3.

Is Gathering of Developers the only people that know how to have fun in this industry.  Why did everyone give the promised lot so much flack?  Why do they all want to shut us down?  We make great games!  We like to have fun, and we like providing all you stuffies with a righteous party environment.

The Gathering, the promised lot, and all of the affiliated developers are just working to keep the essence of this industry alive.  We got into this industry because we enjoy it, it makes us happy, and we like to have 'fun' doing it.  Why would you want to stop that?

Are you afraid that our free and fun-loving nature will seep like a thick gas into the ventalation system of your highly 'political' and overly 'professional' buisness units, asphyxiating your employees and
choke your well oiled machine of its profitability?

Think of us more like laughing gas, everyone LOVES laughing gase... hell I'd go to the dentist once a month if I could guarentee that I would get a decent high.

Wasn't MGS2 awesome?

Doesn't it suck that it takes 30 people, and a 20 million dollar budget to make a game?

Don't get me wrong, I love the direction some of these games are heading... it is amazing what we can accomplish with our technology these days.  The Ingenuity and creativity on display is unsurpassed.  It really shows how much this industry has matured.  We are hitting marks that only hollywood has previously acheived.

I really beleive that Interactive and Digital Entertainment will soon replace TV and film as the 'mainstream' form of entertainment.  Hell, I alone spend more time 'surfing' the web then I do drowning my eyes in all that mediocre television content.  All this growth is simply amazing, it also makes it that much more difficult to compete.

The industry seems to have a bit of polarity.  I was surprised at how many 'budget titles' and 'cookie cutter titles' were being show at e3 this year.  Now instead of watching mediocre television we can play a mediocre game.  What a great exchange! not. 

It is becoming harder, and harder to release a hit title.  The only titles that seem to be generating any money are HUGE blockbuster titles with unbeleivably HUGE budgets, or tiny mass-market budget games with tiny developement budgets.

This sucks for developers.  Especially hard-core gamers like me.

Who has the money to make a Metal Gear Solid, and who honestly wants to make a deer hunter?

Sure, maybe people would enjoy making games that are in-line with their outside hobbies.  These games fill a much needed niche, and if that hobbie is appealing enough then your niche product can hit mainstream numbers.  People actually play  fishing games for gods sake... this fact alone is truely scarey.

One of my outside hobbies is playing games, I guess I'm what you could call a 'hard-core' gamer.  Why does it not seem like the niche market of 'hard-core' gamers is not large enough to support the type of games that we 'hard-core' gamers like to play?

I want to make games that I would personally enjoy playing.  I'm in this industry for my own personal enjoyment, I love what I do.  I want to continue having fun in my career, but sometimes it seems like I am having less and less fun.  I am damn good at what I do, but it just seems be harder and harder to keep up.

I don't want to loose my creative freedom so that I can go work in the corner of some office under the shadow of some untouchable god of gaming, likewise I don't want to be making some watered down budget title.  

I hope all of this growth leaves room for the guys in the middle...
The almighty independant developers.  We are the ones who built this industry.  We need to take back control.  Lets rally.

When is that last time you played a game as fun as Rollercoaster Tycoon?

I hope we don't kill the essence of this industry... let the fun live on.

Hey,

I'm sure everyone is wondering, "Who the heck is this new Jon guy at Ritual?"

(Yeah right... what ever)

Well that is me, Jon Galloway.

I'm heading up development on the "Blair Witch: Episode 3" title that recently entered into development here at Ritual.  We just had our first preview from Incite Magazine.  Check it out at http://www.incite.com.  Here is the full URL.

http://www.incite.com/incite/plsql/incite_main.main?right_menu_depth=0&left_menu_depth=0&in_id=9631&in_type=%25&in_platform=%25

The game is very early in production, and is being developed using the Nocturne engine and it's associated technology.  The story and characters all reside within the Blair Witch mythos.  The game is not based on the movie "The Blair Witch Project", but rather the supernatural legends and myths behind it.  In fact our story takes place in 1785, the year the Blair Witch was persecuted and banished into the black hills woods surrounding the small town of Blair, Maryland.

Anyway... On another note.

Several positions are currently open at Ritual.

3D Modeler / Artist
3D Character Modeler / Animator
