I am about half way through FF-VII...  Is it just me or does the story just kind of drop sometimes?!?  I've always wondered if things get screwed up in the translation process.

Anyone who hasn't already, go over and read the PvP online comic.

It is hilarious...  I think this sort of thing is great for the industry.  I met Scott Kurtz at CPL last weekend, he was sitting at the same table as Densmore.  Scott is one of the funniest guys I have met recently.  I am always suprised at those comic guys... they are always a hoot, but I assume that is partially why he is so good at what he does.  While I'm at it I may as well put in a plug for Densmore...  His show is great as well, always has good interviews.

Well.  I taking off for the holidays.  Back to good old Salt Lake City, Utah.

Have fun, be safe...  Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!!!  See you all next year.  :)

I started replaying FF-VII.  I'm planning on playing through the entire PS series of FF games.  After watching Chris play FF-IX I realize just how far the visual effects have come... even more suprising that it all happens on the playstation.
It is amazing what square can pump out of that machine.  I can't wait for the next FF game on a next-generation console.  I wan't to see them add full voice acting... sure it would add a large chunk to the development cost of the product, but it would be worth it.

Deus Ex wont play on my machine at home!!!  Pisses me off because I was really getting into that game, but I'm sick of staying at work until 2 in the morning... I mean come on, I just came off crunch mode.  My machine is pretty standard afir as well.

Diablo II is fun... just more of the same stuff that made Diablo so fun to begin with... hack and slash!

Icewind Dale is fantastic...  I love RPGs like this.  The graphics are beautiful, the game is deep anf fun.

Giants...  All I can really say at this point is that this game is hilarious.  Never have I laughed so hard as I did when watching Darin play this game.  The cinematics are a riot.  I'm definately going to pick this one up.

I still need one game that can addict me the way Starcraft and warcraft did!  I want a game I just can't put down.  I'm starting to think that maybe I am just burned out on sitting in front of a screen... definate possability.  Maybe I should get back to some good old fashioned gaming.

D and D anyone, Axies and Allies?!?  Hey Scott, if you read this message me!!!



12/15/2000 -> Yes MORE.
=======================

I went out and bought a DVD player and a surround sound system last night!

Now all I need is a PS2... too bad there aren't any.

I'm jonesing for a really good game, one that will engross me and soak up hours due to a good old time addiction.

This message was in my e-mail box this morning.

Hey Sean, just poking fun... 

-----------------

Keep us all updated on the Alli/Brooke situation.  Remember, there are
a lot of geeks out here.. most of us live vicariously from one cool
story like yours to the next.


Thanks!
Sean Reardon.

The Hero's Tale...

There is a couple of hotties that live in my apartment complex... college girls.  You gotta love em.

Sometimes it's nice being the 'computer guy'.

Alli calls my cell phone and leaves a message... "Jon, it's an emergency. My computer crashed, can you come over and fix it.  I had a paper due for my final today... I think I'm screwed."

Suddenly my mind starts to wander, I begin to think to myself "Maybe this is just a ploy to get me over to their apartment.  Yeah, they want me!"

I call over to their house, Alli is not there but Brooke answers.  "Hey Jon, Alli really needs your help.  Her computer is broken and she needs you to come over and save her final."  "Should I just come over?" I ask.  She replies, "Yeah, the doors open.  I'll be in the back waiting... I'll call and make sure Alli is back before you get here."

Sounds fishy to me.  I start to get a little excited.

I mossey over to their apartment.  I go inside, and that is when I start to feel a little bit bad.  

Turns out they were serious.  Alli is upset and crying like it is the end of the world or something, Brooke is comforting her.  How selfish could I be... thinking only of my needs, when this poor young student was suffering such torment at the hands of modern technology!

I look at the computer... it is dead!  "I'll give it a shot, no promises." I say.  I go to work, trying everything I can think of to get that damn thing up and running.  Meanwhile I am getting the works.  Non-stop attention for hours.  "Oh, you're so sweet to do this."  "You're the nicest guy." "etc..."  By this time several other friends had happened by.  Now I was really in the spot light.  I had to win this battle, I was determined.

I'm lapping it up of course, givin them the techno-speak "Well, your config file and win.com files are hosed."  "We're going to have to shut down and reinstall your operating system."  "What does that mean?  Will it fix it?" they ask.  I reply, "Well I might have to run scandisk and do a full surface scan on the hard drive to detect and repair any problems... it might fix it."  "Oh wow, sounds complicated." they say.  "Sure is, this might take some time." I suggest.

Sounds like the beginning to some cheese-ball threesome porno, eh!  I wish... but no luck!

Sorry to disappoint you all, but nothing much happened.  5 hours and 2 windows installs later I was frustrated, tired, and actionless.  The pep squad were bored watching TV on the couch, the pampering had ceased...  hope seemed to loom just out of reach.  "if only I could get this damn thing working." I thought to myself.  My head dropped to the keyboard, frustrated.

BEEP.

I look up.  The damned machine is booting!  "Bring it on..." I think to myself.
I fixed the computer and the OS, but the final was gone... missing... corrupted... whatever.  Things were not going well.  I luckily managed to restore bits and peices of the history file from lingering word temp files, about 75% of the paper was still there in sections.

Turns out I was the hero after all!  I may not have gotten much action, but they are taking me out for drinks later this week.  It's a start, I'll keep you all posted.

And the morale of the story is...  Geeks can get girls too, your skills are useful for more then just playing games.

Trust me, it all made for quite an interesting evening.

I went to my car last night and my entire SUV was covered in a sheet of ice.

1/4 to 1/2 inches thick.  It looked like I might be able to remove the entire thing in one peice and have a life sized ice replica of the HoG mobile.

They don't sell windsheild scrapers here in the south, so I had to chip it off with the hardest thing I could find in my car... an altoids box.
If that isn't the lamest thing I have ever heard then I don't know what is!  If I heard someone else say that I would think..."What a dumbass!  An altoids box."

Then we come to today...

So I went out to my car this morning and it was covered in a sheet of ice... NOT AGAIN!

This time my doors and locks were frozen shut.

I finally made it to work after having to following several texas idiots for several miles driving 30 mph side by side blocking the entire freeway.
This town gets a little ice and suddenly everyone is driving like they are high and paranoid... kind of like LevelLord acts all the time.

Screw you guys, I'm going home.

If anyone reads this damned plan file... We have a bunch of new guys here at Ritual.

I want to start a thread on value titles/budget titles.

What do the gamers think about these sort of games?

What types of games would gamers like to see in the under $30 range?

I personally would like to take a year and make an A quality title that will sell for $20-30.

Something short and sweet.  Not a ton of new technology, not the most innovative technology.
Just something really fun, that is done really well.  'Quality' and 'Fun' would be the focus.

Existing engine (not nocturne)... something suited more towards 'real' action.

8-12 month developement cycle.

10-20 hours of gameplay.

I want to know what people would really enjoy.  What would make you want to purchase and play this sort of game?

If anyone has any comment or ideas give me a holler at jon@ritual.com.
