Well it is March...  I'm sure this is no new news to anyone.

What is interesting, but of probably little importance is that I have now been at Ritual for over a year.  YES.  400 days to be exact.  I started here at Ritual the second week of February last year.  If you count the overtime it's more like 600 days, but who's counting?

Many things have happened to me in the last year, it has been quite an interesting ride.

Being able to work and play with the Ritualites.  KEWL... all hail the Levelord!

Hanging out with Kevin Eastman.  Pretty damned kewl.

Heavy Metal FaKK2 and Blair Witch both shipped.  Very very kewl.

My twin brother got a job with GoD and was able to move to Dallas.  Very kewl.

He moved in with my girlfriend.  Kewl at the time.

Girlfriend and HoG_JoNNy call it quits.  Not kewl.

Josh lives with x-girlfriend.  Kewl no longer.

Diakatana came... Diakatana went.

Deus Ex shipped... kewl.

Anachronox...  would be kewl!

Younger brother passes away during ECTS.  Definitely not kewl.

X-Girlfriend moves to Florida.  Sorry to have to say, but this is somewhat kewl... mostly kewl for her.

My first Mardi Gra.  Awesome.

Meeting all my new friends and acquaintances.  Priceless.  hehe... had to throw in some cheese.

Ritual splits.  In my opinion not kewl.

Remaining Ritualites hard at work to bring you two new titles.  Definately very kewl.

Anyway, that's my short reflection on my first year here at Ritual.  I'm sure there were many more significant and not so significant things... but I have to get back to work.

I can't wait for Black and White.  I'm over here pissing my pants.  There are usually very few games lately that I really want to buy and play... Black and White is one of them.

It seems that there are actually quite a few games recently that I am looking forward to.  Honestly this has not happened for some time, I feel that is a very sad thing.  I have been making games for about 8 years now, but I have been playing them since the good old days of the 8088.  I can say with honesty that there have been few modern games that hold as tight a grasp on my memories as the likes of Zork, Starflight, Wasteland, or Bards Tale.  Mayeb Starcraft.  I have probably logged more hours in that game then any other (unless dating counts).  Quake is a given as well.  Doesn't even need to be said.

You have to hand it to those Blizzard guys. I'm near positive that Warcraft 3 will be my favorite game this year.

I'd really like a new PC RPG though.  I've gotten into Icewind Dale and the likes.  There are really great games, but they don't hold my interest long enough.  I am sick of dungeons and dragons... Give me new and interesting settings, give me more Fallout.  Anyone has any really good suggestions?

Give me the liscense to create a modern incarnation to Starflight.  No, not Battlecruiser...  I SAID starflight!
