======================
Friday night was a blast...  more people showed up then I expected.  You know getting out of the office to go hang out and have fun with people of like mind is really a good idea.  Schmoozing and networking is fun, drinking is fun, eating is fun.  I derive pleasure from hanging out with my friends.  Why wouldn't you want to surround yourself with some of the most creative and talented people out there?!?

It seems that we can party, have a good time, and ship games by our dealines.  You know it sucks that some people just seem to feel threatened by how cool we are over here at Ritual.  These guys are the best.  Rob, Richard, everyone else... we aren't looking to cause anyone to feel contempt.  We are just out to have a good time.  We slave away in theis industry and it is healthy to let your hair down once in a while.

Everybody should think about joining us next time.  I doubt that anyone who joined us had anything negative to say about their experience that evening.  Levelord may have grabbed my ass a few times, but it was far from being masochistic.

BTW  I started playing NOLF this weekend...  wonderful game.  It is so much fun.  The levels are a little boxy and sometimes bland, but the game is so involving.  Once I got over the awful rendering bugs, the whole experience just kind of drew me in.  I really like how the gameplay is broken up with objectives and short sequences that break you out of the standard FPS gameplay.  This is probably the best game that has come out of Monolith to date.
