======================

Well it is March...  I'm sure this is no new news to anyone.

What is interesting, but of probably little importance is that I have now been at Ritual for over a year.  YES.  400 days to be exact.  I started here at Ritual the second week of February last year.  If you count the overtime it's more like 600 days, but who's counting?

Many things have happened to me in the last year, it has been quite an interesting ride.

Being able to work and play with the Ritualites.  KEWL... all hail the Levelord!

Hanging out with Kevin Eastman.  Pretty damned kewl.

Heavy Metal FaKK2 and Blair Witch both shipped.  Very very kewl.

My twin brother got a job with GoD and was able to move to Dallas.  Very kewl.

He moved in with my girlfriend.  Kewl at the time.

Girlfriend and HoG_JoNNy call it quits.  Not kewl.

Josh lives with x-girlfriend.  Kewl no longer.

Diakatana came... Diakatana went.

Deus Ex shipped... kewl.

Anachronox...  would be kewl!

Younger brother passes away during ECTS.  Definitely not kewl.

X-Girlfriend moves to Florida.  Sorry to have to say, but this is somewhat kewl... mostly kewl for her.

My first Mardi Gra.  Awesome.

Meeting all my new friends and acquaintances.  Priceless.  hehe... had to throw in some cheese.

Ritual splits.  In my opinion not kewl.

Remaining Ritualites hard at work to bring you two new titles.  Definately very kewl.

Anyway, that's my short reflection on my first year here at Ritual.  I'm sure there were many more significant and not so significant things... but I have to get back to work.
