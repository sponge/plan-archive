=======================
I've been looking for a copy of 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' on DVD for some time now...  I didn't find one, so I last night I spent the money on simCity 3000.  I know it seems like a bit of a bad trade off.  I'll find a copy of the movie later this week, meanwhile I can build my own city!  Too bad that no matter what I do my city is not nearly as cool as Vegas.  How about an adult oriented SinCity version of the game?!?  I guess it might not be enough just to build the strip joints, you'd probably want to go in them as well... most people would probably just rather spend the time watching a 'naughty' DVD *<blush>*

For some reason I have this weird love/hate relationship with games like SimCity.  I hate that it wastes my time, yet it is so addicting that I stayed up till 3am playing it.  It's stupid there is absolutely no goal, no ending or immediate stopping point... your chasing after this imaginery golden carrot of "the perfect city".  You're always on the edge of putting the game down, then you think "I could just improve this one area really quick, then I'll go to bed." or "If I could just add this 4 lane super highway through the middle of HoG_JoNNyVille the transportation system would be so much smoother, I'll just take out a little loan..."  You spend the next hour trying to build a damn freeway, and you never get to the point where you really understand the 'rules' for placeing on and off ramps.  Why do you care anyway?  Because if you don't build it, the damned Sims can't fucking get to work.  If they can't get to work they hate you and throw eggs at your nice mayors mansion (if you were lucky enough to get one).  Plus I hate the reward system in SimCity.  I feel better about placing a crime ridden, money grabbing casino in town then I do building a self gratifying 64 pixel tall statue of the mayor (yourself).  It's just another damned building, just like all of the other buildings.  Al the buildings do is throw off the balance of the city so that eventually you will have to build more infastructure to support the constantly shifting society.  It never ends... it is so addicting.  I hate it... no wait I love it.  Damn it.

I like games with a purpose or a goal, I mean a real tangible goal... like quake.  Run around and KILL everybody as many times as possible.  In the process try to get yourself KILLED as little as possible.  The game is over in 15 minutes and despite the fact ParadoX kicked your teeth in you feel like you actually did something meaningful with the time.

In a very 'lofty' manner, Chris told me he thinks that city building is an 'Art form' an therefore is satisfying in and of itself.  I think chris needs to get his teeth kicked in...

Oh yeah, come on people...  I need those suggestions on what to get my mother for her Birthday.  Send them to jon@ritual.com.  If I get enough I will post the results.

=======================

I went out and bought Alpha Centauri last week.  I got it for $9.  It is a blast and worth every cent... it is also highly addictive.  I can't beleive that I never got around to buying it before.

My mother came to town this last weekend.  That was fun... That woman can SHOP.  We must have done like a 30 hour shopping marathon.  Everything from antique malls and eclectic stores, to Neiman Marcus.  She even made us take her to West End.  I work in West End... I want to be here as little as possible.

Funny story...  My mother is VERY mormon.  My brother and her just show up to my office yesterday.  I had no idea they were comming up until I turned around and saw them standing behind me.  Then I kind of freaked out... I glance to my left.  Shit!  There sitting on my desk are 2 of the big sins.  Lying on my desk next to each other is a bottle of tequilla and a Playboy book of nudes.  I'm thinking, "Moms gonna think I'm some kind of boozing sex junkie."  Then I remebered all the Sin and Heavy Metal propaganda littering the office...  You should also understand that my mother is some what of a feminist, she wouldn't allow my sisters to play with Barbies because they were sex symbols.  This place couldn't possibly offend her more, I was sure I wouldn't hear the end of it once we left.

Facts are.  I don't drink tequilla, it was left over from the Christmas party.  Beleive it or not, the playboy book was intended to be a drawing aide.  I want to learn to draw the human figure... live models are expensive.

That is also not to say that I don't enjoy liquor and beautiful woman, I like them both quite a bit.  I just want to make mother proud... you know?

Why is it that we can be adults, whether 26 or 40 something and we still have a desire to have our parents approve of us?  Just ask Levelord.

Besides not wanting me to drink, or look at nude woman... my mother never wanted me to make violent video games either.  She always pushes for me to make Olymipic Figure Ice Skating - For Girls! videogames instead.  Then I tell her that the top selling title for girls is 'Barbie: This or that' and she shuts up.

Anyway.  My mother never said a thing about the tequila or the playboy, and although I saw her observing a half naked picture of Julie Strain on the wall I never heard anything about that either.  I guess that is the benefit of growing up, eventually your parents just let you be who you are and don't give you much shit about it.


So my mothers birthday is this month and I have no idea what to get her.  She is 50 something, short, and a little bit cooky (but I love her).  I am taking a poll for suggestions... give them up.  jon@ritual.com.
