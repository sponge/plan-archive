=======================

I went out and bought Alpha Centauri last week.  I got it for $9.  It is a blast and worth every cent... it is also highly addictive.  I can't beleive that I never got around to buying it before.

My mother came to town this last weekend.  That was fun... That woman can SHOP.  We must have done like a 30 hour shopping marathon.  Everything from antique malls and eclectic stores, to Neiman Marcus.  She even made us take her to West End.  I work in West End... I want to be here as little as possible.

Funny story...  My mother is VERY mormon.  My brother and her just show up to my office yesterday.  I had no idea they were comming up until I turned around and saw them standing behind me.  Then I kind of freaked out... I glance to my left.  Shit!  There sitting on my desk are 2 of the big sins.  Lying on my desk next to each other is a bottle of tequilla and a Playboy book of nudes.  I'm thinking, "Moms gonna think I'm some kind of boozing sex junkie."  Then I remebered all the Sin and Heavy Metal propaganda littering the office...  You should also understand that my mother is some what of a feminist, she wouldn't allow my sisters to play with Barbies because they were sex symbols.  This place couldn't possibly offend her more, I was sure I wouldn't hear the end of it once we left.

Facts are.  I don't drink tequilla, it was left over from the Christmas party.  Beleive it or not, the playboy book was intended to be a drawing aide.  I want to learn to draw the human figure... live models are expensive.

That is also not to say that I don't enjoy liquor and beautiful woman, I like them both quite a bit.  I just want to make mother proud... you know?

Why is it that we can be adults, whether 26 or 40 something and we still have a desire to have our parents approve of us?  Just ask Levelord.

Besides not wanting me to drink, or look at nude woman... my mother never wanted me to make violent video games either.  She always pushes for me to make Olymipic Figure Ice Skating - For Girls! videogames instead.  Then I tell her that the top selling title for girls is Barbie: This or that and she shuts up.

Anyway.  My mother never said a thing about the tequila or the playboy, and although I saw her observing a half naked picture of Julie Strain on the wall I never heard anything about that either.  I guess that is the benefit of growing up, eventually your parents just let you be who you are and don't give you much shit about it.


So my mothers birthday is this month and I have no idea what to get her.  She is 50 something, short, and a little bit cooky (but I love her).  I am taking a poll for suggestions... give them up.  jon@ritual.com.
