The above silence was in memory of Doug Myers.  He will be missed.  Aside from my boyz here at Ritual, Gathering of Developers is like my second family.  Of course it helps that my twin brother Josh works there.  Still, it is nice to know there are so many people in this industry who are watching my back.

I spent three hours installing drivers and DX8 on my home machine... just so I could play Homeworld: Cataclysm.
After 3-4 installs, a hour or so of tweaking settings and about 20 restarts I finally got it to work.  I am so happy.

We are still plugging away on our mysterious unannounced title.  Wish I could say more about the project, but I can't really say much.  Things are looking very good.  We have added a whole bunch of new commands and functionality to the ghost particle system.
We have also been doing some work on new tools to make our lives easier.  It's really hard not being able to actively 'pimp' all the cool stuff we are working on....  GRRRRR.
