i'm trying to update this a bit more often, so you guys can get
a feel for who i am...

my bookmarks rock. i just spent 3 hours digging around and finally
bookmarking a lot of sites i usually visit casually and then some.
i use netscape 4.0 and incase you didn't know, you can use the
'personal toolbar' to add folders too. if you keep the folder names
short (i limit mine to 1-2 characters), you can fit about 12-15
of them in a row on a standard width browser (fullscreening your 
browser on anything above 640x480 is just plain wrong). this way
i can emulate another row of dropdown menues and can access my
bookmark categories quicker.

i'm super methodical about how i structure my bookmark hierarchy 
too. gotta keep up with the competition somehow and know who's
out there and doing what. my only gripe is i can't name the little
seperator entries.

i just need more time. i'm bursting with ideas and plans and
only have so many hours a day (about 24). the fall gaming season
isn't exactly going to help. i think i'm just going to give up 
sleep. i mean... what's the point? why would i want to be 
unconcious for 6-8 hours a day?

planetcrap.com (nope, not one of our network sites ;) has been
digging up some interesting stories lately and getting some
good discussion threads going. if you want to see some postings
of core people here at the pq network spilling out their guts
about who we are and why we do what we do, stop by. 
congratulations morn and the rest of the gang on putting together
a good niche site.

oh, and i'm growing a goatee again. let's see how long i last
this time,
