SHAMELESS SELF PROMOTION: Woo! Kickass Planet Quake redesign! Run, don't
walk there now:

Finally a site that doesn't use a black background.

Oh and double Woo! Beatdown LAN party at PQ headquarters this weekend.
I'm psyched!

Ho boy, I haven't updated this thing in a while. It's 3:19 AM and I had
my first cup of coffee since 1987 just now. It tasted horrible.

So anyway, I figured since it seems to be fashionable to use your .plan
file for personal quests, I'd give it a go. I'm apartment hunting in
New York City right now. If anyone knows anything in East or West Village 
or nearby (one room apartment, maybe even a share), that's affordable
(no really. stop laughing), drop me a note.
