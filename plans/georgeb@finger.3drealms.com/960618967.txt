Gone in 60 Seconds.

This movie title could be used to describe Producer
Jerry Bruckheimer's career if he keeps giving us crap
like this to watch.

With his old producing partner Don Simpson (who died of
a drug oversose a couple of years ago, we got movies
like).

With Don Simpson we got:

Rock, The (1996) 
Dangerous Minds (1995) 
Crimson Tide (1995) 
Bad Boys (1995) 
Days of Thunder (1990) 
Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) 
Top Gun (1986) 
Beverly Hills Cop (1984) 


Post Don Simpson we get:

Gone in 60 Seconds (crap)
Enemy of the State (crap)
Armageddon (pretty good)
Con Air (pretty good)

Have to wonder if the real talent died with Simpson.

If you're going to go see Gone in 60 Seconds, bear in
mind there isn't an awesome car chase to be seen.  You
won't see cool shots (more than glimpses) of exotic
sports cars.  

But in it's place you will get a lot of talking and 
character development you won't care about.  We all 
wanted to see kick ass cars, screaming in high pursuit 
chases, and high tech/cool car thievery didn't we?  

Well you're not getting any of that here.  If anyone
watches the ending car chase and actually gives a rats
ass, email me ;)

I tell you now.  The Hummer/Ferrari chase in the Rock
DESTROYS anything in this movie.  Period.  Done, next.

Nine people went.  Nine fairly negative reviews.
