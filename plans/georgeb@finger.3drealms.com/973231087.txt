I finished No One Lives Forever a couple of days
ago.  It clocked in at a little over 17 hours for 
me on Normal mode.  (P2/450 w/Voodoo 3).

No other way to put this - NOLF is the best FPS
since Half-Life.  Bar none.  It's not even close.
It has great levels, gameplay, voice acting, story, 
characters, inventory - on and on.

Forget what you know or think you know from the 
demo.  You played 2-3 levels ripped from various
parts of the game, and got no sense of the overall
game.

Sit down and play NOLF from start to finish and
it will simply suck you in.  I doubt you will be
dissapointed if you like FPS games with action.
If you've always wanted Goldeneye (N64) for the PC,
this is it, on steroids.

Plus, Kate's a babe.  This game deserves to be in 
the top 20, so go buy it.

Stunning job Monolith and the NOLF team.
