Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project is gold!  The masters are being prepared and sent off for duplication now.

The game should be out in a couple of weeks, and we'll let you know a more specific date soon.

Sunstorm did a great job with the game and delivered the best licensed Duke Nukem game to date.

Best of all, for $25 it'll kick your ass, but won't break your wallet.  Try it, you'll like it.
