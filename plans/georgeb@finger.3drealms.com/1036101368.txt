We're looking for some Environmental Artists.

REQUIREMENTS

* Very good knowledge of Photoshop.  You will be required to texture your own modeling work and have a willingness to work with photo-realistic source and reference.

* Very good knowledge of a modelling package (3DS Max preferred).  You will be modeling architecture and environment elements for maps.

* A strong eye for architecture and environment design.  Any traditional concept art skills are a plus.

* Professional game industry experience is a plus, but not a requirement.  Your talent, personality and an impressive portfolio are more important than experience.

* You need to be a game player and love to play and talk about games, or you're not going to fit in here.

* You must be at least 18 years old, a US citizen, and willing to relocate to Garland, Texas .


WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

* We're not looking for map designers.  We're looking for artists that can take a basic shell of a level and detail it out with geometry that you will build and texture.

* We expect a certain level of technical expertise.  The ideal candidate will understand the technology they have access to, as well as concepts of maintaining target frame rates and polygon budgets.

* You will be expected to learn our level editor so you can work closely with the map designers.


BENEFITS

* You will share in the profits generated from the game you work on.

* Signing bonus is available based on experience.

* Medical / dental insurance. 

* Moving expenses.

* No publisher pressure on milestones or shipping to meet a quarter. We ship the game when it's ready. Your pressure comes from working with a small team of highly motivated people that demand excellence.
