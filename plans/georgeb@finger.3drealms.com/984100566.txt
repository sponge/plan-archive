[Programming Jobs]

We've filled the two programming spots we had available 
and we'll announce specifics in a coule of days.

I'd like to thank those that applied.  We got a bunch of
great resumes and there were many qualified applicants.

I was surprised to get several very good resumes through
a post I made on the FatBabies forums.  It would seem 
that that's a fairly good resource if you are looking for
people with industry experience (and you won't have to pay
a ridiculous $300-$500 like you would to advertise on 
Gamastura).  I recommend trying it.

[Conker's Bad Fur Day]

What can I say?  IMO, it's one of the greatest video games
ever made.  It once again solidifies Rare as one of the
top game developers in the world.  The game is amazing.
It's funny, raunchy and a breath of fresh air in the 
gaming industry.
