3D Realms is looking to hire some new programmers (to help finish
up Duke Nukem Forever - as well as build infrastructure for our next
project). We currently have four programmers on DNF all of which 
have shipped multiple titles (one on tech, one on multiplayer, one on 
AI and one on pure gameplay).

What we're looking for:

* Tech Programmer - You are a person that understands core principles 
involved with creating 3D game engines and working with things like 
video drivers. You love the low level stuff. You've shipped a game or 
two and taken a major role in the creation of technology on your 
projects.  (Professional experience or major tech/engine demo required).

* Gameplay Programmer - You are a person that lives and breathes playing 
games. You play them all the time and this experience gives you an 
intimate knowledge of what makes a game fun. You love to program 
gameplay elements that make the game come alive. You've shipped a game 
or two.  You are very experienced in C++ and don't mind working with 
UnrealScript.  (Professional experience a plus, but not required).

- You must be over 18, live in the USA and be willing to relocate for a
full time position.

- Being local to Dallas is a major plus for either spot and will garner
you additional signing bonus money.

What you get:

- Industry standard salary - depending on experience/projects worked on
- Signing bonus
- Moving expenses
- Medical/Dental
- You share in every dollar 3D Realms makes off the game you work on 
(Duke Nukem Forever), across all ports, merchandising etc.
- Whatever else you can talk me out of
