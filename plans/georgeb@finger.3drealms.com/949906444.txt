We are looking for an additional programmer for Duke Nukem 
Forver.  Now is the time to send in a resume if you are 
interested.

WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

This will be a variety packed position, and we'll discuss the 
exact tasks to be done during the interview. 


MAJOR REQUIREMENTS

* Professional experience coding with the Unreal engine 
preferred.  If you are working on an Unreal engine game now, 
contact us.  You owe it to yourself to consider the option.

* Professional experience on a major 3D engine, or having
shipped (or worked on) an FPS game before.  

* User Community experience, working on killer mods for Unreal, 
Quake, Half-Life, or other major games.  The more popular the mod
the better.  If you're the new up and comer, give us a shout.


BASIC REQUIREMENTS

* Knowledge of C and C++ (required), 3D programming concepts, 
and a clean, professional coding style that will works with 
multiple programmers on one project.  We will want to see code 
samples but don't send them now.

* Die hard game player. If you don't have a passion to play them, 
you typically don't have the passion to make them.

* Must be 18 years old, US citizen, and willing to relocate to 
Garland, Texas.  Also willing to work 10-12 hour days and weekends.


BENEFITS

* First and foremost you share in the profits generated from the
game.  Something few places can offer.  You get this in addition 
to a salary.  And with Duke Nukem Forever, you can reasonably
expect this game to be a commercial success.

* Signing bonus available for anyone with professional 3D game 
experience (bonus based on experience, products shipped and
current situation).

* Full medical / dental insurance.

* No publisher pressure.  We ship the game when it's ready.
Your only pressure comes from working with a highly motivated 
team of people that demand excellence.

* Access to a fully stocked LARGE freezer with mass amounts of
frozen goodies (chicken sandwiches, hamburgers, pizzas--all
the food you can eat, and all the cokes and snacks you can eat.
We make a huge run once a month to stock up.  And of course, 
it's all FREE!

for passing that up.
