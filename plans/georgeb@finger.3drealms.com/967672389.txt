WORK ON DUKE NUKEM FOREVER

We are looking for a fourth and final programmer for Duke Nukem 
Forever.  Currently we have one person dedicated to tech, 
one to AI, and one to general gameplay.  The fourth spot will 
focus on multiplayer / general gameplay and be a Jack of All
Trades.

WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

- Fluent knowledge of C/C++ (you have to know more than scripting).

- Professional experience with the Unreal engine/Unreal Script.

- Professional experience on any game (First Person Shooter preferred).

- Experience on a killer game mod.

- A die hard game player.  This is a gameplay programming spot, so 
you need to know what makes a cool game.

- You must be over 18 years of age, a US citizen and willing to
relocate and work full time (no contracting).

WHAT YOU WILL GET

- A bonus based on EVERY gross dollar 3D Realms makes on DNF.  (Do
you get this at your current company?  Will it amount to six
figures?)

- $10,000 signing bonus if you have professional Unreal experience.

- $5,000 signing bonus if you have professional experience and are
local to the Dallas area.

- We'll pay your moving expenses.

- Full medical / dental insurance.
