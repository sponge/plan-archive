GOODBYE

We say goodbye to Chris Hargrove tomorrow.  Chris will be
missed and has been with DNF since it's start.  Chris is
leaving for mainly personal reasons and it is 100% amicable.

His new e-mail is: chrish@usac.net

Also, Chris has done a small interview on GameDev.net that
will clarify his leaving to put the rumor mill to rest.  You
can read it at:

Chris picked a perfect time to leave, and we appreciate
that.  His skeletal animation and model system are 
essentially done and no major work has been done on them 
in a few weeks.  Lately he's been working on AI as we've 
moved to the game play phase of the project.

I know I speak for the entire team when I say, good luck
Chris and stay in touch.
