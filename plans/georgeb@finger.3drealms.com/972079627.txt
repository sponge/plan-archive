[Word from Valhalla]

Odin:  Ragnar, what is best in life?

Ragnar:  To crush your enemies, see them 
driven before you, and to hear the lamentations 
of their women!  Also to dine on lizard heads.

Odin:  Yes, Ragnar...you are a man now.

[Word from Earth]

I got a gold copy of Rune a few days ago and
finished it Wednesday night, after about 16
hours of playtime.

It's probably one of the best 3rd person 
action games to date on the PC, and should be
on your shopping list.
