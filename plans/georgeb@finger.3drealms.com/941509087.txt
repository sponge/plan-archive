Wow!  Response to the DNF shots has been great.  So great in fact,
that our site is completely overloaded.  Here's some additional 
places to get the files.  

There's a ZIP file on an ftp site that has all the pics:

Thanks to all those setting up mirrors.

Please email me any new ones:  georgeb@3drealms.com

Also, please REMOVE the scanned versions of the shots from your sites!

Well, here you go Duke fans. You've screamed about it for months
and it's finally time. We're posting the first shots of Duke Nukem
Forever using the Unreal engine. These were done for the December 
issue of PC Gamer. It appears that their German counterpart has 
already released their version of the article. 

As a result, the DNF shots are being scanned and posted like mad 
across the net. Since this is inevitable and we'd like people to 
see the game as it's intended, we're releasing the real shots now, 
a little ahead of schedule. Apologies to the fine folks at PC Gamer 
(and Gary Whitta in particular), but they will still sell a zillion 
copies of the magazine ;) 

Make sure to go buy a copy and get all the inside scoop on 
Duke Nukem Forever.  Enjoy the shots, and please set up mirrors as 
fast as you can, so our site doesn't explode.
