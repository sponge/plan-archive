Max Payne update.

[Win2K/GeForece 3 bug]

The problem has been found and a patch made for it.  Remedy said it was a memory leak (a 2 line code change) and that it was actually affecting all systems.  It just affected GeForce 3 systems more.

The problem has been reproduced at 3DR, Remedy and Take 2 and the patch has been verified to fix the problem.  We will test the patch for a bit and probably release it soon (for the weekend).  

It's going to be small - weighing in at about 6 megs.  We will contact many, many web sites and give the patch directly to them.  No single source nonsense.

We're really sorry this slipped through, but something just had to.  I'm glad Rememdy was able to isolate it so quickly and prepare a patch.

We also appreciate all the fan support and understanding so far.  People seem to like the game and Max has been selling quickly (around here at least).

Rememdy and 3DR will continue to support the game to the best of our abilities.
