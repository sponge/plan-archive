ENSIGN NOBODY'S STATUS REPORT

Tuvok:  Ensign, it's been a few hours since I asked you to
examine "Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force".  Have you done
so?

Ensign Nobody:  Yes Sir, I have.

Tuvok:  What is your assessment Ensign?

Ensign Nobody:  Well, sir...may I speak freely?

Tuvok:  Yes Ensign.

Ensign Nobody:  I finished the game in 9 hours in normal
mode, with no cheats or skipping of cinematics.  I also
got 4 soda's, relieved myself 3 times and checked email 
a few times and mingled with co-workers.  I even watched 
all the way through the German voice credits Sir.

Tuvok:  You have done well Ensign.  Please get your gear
and weapons, practice on the Holodeck, mingle in the lounge
and I will call on you soon.

Ensign Nobody:  Sir, yes Sir!
