Well here I am newly arrived at Legend from Bethesda to animate Unreal2 and there is so much enthusiasm for the project I know it is going to be a memorable time. Lots of ideas buzzing around and some really clever people. 

A quick shout to Gary and the team on the other side of the river. I know Morrowind will be a great game too.  These are potent times!
