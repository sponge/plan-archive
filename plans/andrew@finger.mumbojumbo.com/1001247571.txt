"What I Did Today", by Andrew Meggs                        Grade 2


build 94

* final optimizations of SSE code
* fixed monsters getting stuck inside impassable cells
* textures detail control now works
* fixed crashes and out-of-syncs when playing sounds via map actions
when volume is 0
* film playback is fixed yet again. sigh.
* logos and colors are now inherited by gibs, animated attachments,
detachments, attack projectiles, and just about everything else


build 95

* fix fisj crash when playing back a skelanim with only 1 frame
* SSE lighting fixed


build 96

This fixes the crash introduced in build 94 when the warlock dies. Let's
play -- we need test coverage on the new pathfinding.


build 97

* always re-lookup logo index in client table on incoming player data
packets
* always sets limited visibility on net maps
* write debugging info on network queue failure
* changed selection bars at designer request to make top more obvious
* monsters on opposing teams completely under water are not drawn
* monsters at edges of visibility are rendered transparent
* clicking on ground passes through media
* don't compute environment map coordinates for models with no
environment map
* ignores media coverage map and simply tests media height against land
height to determine if a point is underwater
* monsters which float use higher of land height and media height
* fixed crash with sound source markers


build 98

* internal ability to set each model's alpha independently
* your own units get a slight transparency when underwater to indicate
invisibility to others
* easier/better clicking of underwater terrain and objects
* selection rings/bars are faded out by model's alpha
* water texture resolution is not reduced
