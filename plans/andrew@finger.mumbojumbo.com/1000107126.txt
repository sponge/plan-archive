I have a dark secret. Sure, I have blue hair. And sure, maybe I do have many an article of black clothing hanging in my closet. And yes, I do listen to a lot of music by  European artists who are decidedly non-mainstream even in their own countries. And when I go home tonight, I will not just be watching anime, I will be sitting in front of my computer watching anime that I downloaded off the Internet. And yes, last summer I did read over 4800 pages of fantasy paperbacks. But despite all this, deep in my heart of hearts, I FUCKING LOVE NFL FOOTBALL!!!!

There. I've said it. We now return to the regularly scheduled geekery while I try to figure out why Washington still has Westbrook around yet let Connell and Thrash get away.
