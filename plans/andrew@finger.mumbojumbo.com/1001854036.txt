I installed MacOS 10.1 today. It is, in fact, everything promised. I'd been neglecting our MacOS builds in the hope that Apple would put out a version of X that wasn't painful to use by the time we had to put together a Mac version of Myth 3. With 10.1 and a copy of CodeWarrior 7, it looks like they just barely made it.

Because of the transitional state of MacOS, for the last few months my Mac had been used mostly as a CD player. While it's now back in action as a development box, the first thing I did after getting 10.1 up was fire up iTunes and drop in a Krisiun CD. Imagine my pleasant surprise on discovering that the database that Apple has provided for iTunes was already familiar with this delightful little album:

With an inverted pentagram dripping in blood and not one but FOUR upside-down crosses, you really can't pack much more Satan onto one album cover. I'd like to commend Steve Jobs not only for designing a user interface that looks so good I want to lick it, but for making it Lucifer-ready right out of the box. Go Apple!
