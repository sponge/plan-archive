When you're wearing an old Prong T-shirt featuring an eyeball being removed
with a fork, khaki pants that you got in 9th grade in a failed bid to fit
in with the preppies who harrassed you, and a pair of never-worn socks
received for Christmas 1999 that say "2000" in festive letters, you know it's
time to take on the laundry that's been piling up since the alpha milestone.


Saturday, August 22
-------------------

build 98

* internal ability to set each model's alpha independently
* your own units get a slight transparency when underwater to indicate
invisibility to others
* easier/better clicking of underwater terrain and objects
* selection rings/bars are faded out by model's alpha
* water texture resolution is not reduced


build 97

* always re-lookup logo index in client table on incoming player data
packets
* always sets limited visibility on net maps
* write debugging info on network queue failure
* changed selection bars at designer request to make top more obvious
* monsters on opposing teams completely under water are not drawn
* monsters at edges of visibility are rendered transparent
* clicking on ground passes through media
* don't compute environment map coordinates for models with no
environment map
* ignores media coverage map and simply tests media height against land
height to determine if a point is underwater
* monsters which float use higher of land height and media height
* fixed crash with sound source markers


build 96

This fixes the crash introduced in build 94 when the warlock dies. Let's
play -- we need test coverage on the new pathfinding.


build 95

* fix fisj crash when playing back a skelanim with only 1 frame
* SSE lighting fixed


build 94

* final optimizations of SSE code
* fixed monsters getting stuck inside impassable cells
* textures detail control now works
* fixed crashes and out-of-syncs when playing sounds via map actions
when volume is 0
* film playback is fixed yet again. sigh.
* logos and colors are now inherited by gibs, animated attachments,
detachments, attack projectiles, and just about everything else
