Well, here you go Duke fans. You've screamed about it for months and it's finally time. We're posting the first shots of Duke Nukem Forever using the Unreal engine. These were done for the December issue of PC Gamer. It appears that their German counterpart has already released their version of the article. 

As a result, the DNF shots are being scanned and posted like mad across the net. Since this is inevitable and we'd like people to see the game as it's intended, we're releasing the real shots now, a little ahead of schedule. Apologies to the fine folks at PC Gamer (and Gary Whitta in particular), but they will still sell a zillion copies of the magazine ;) 

Make sure to go buy a copy and get all the inside scoop of Duke Nukem Forever.  Enjoy the shots, and please set up mirrors as fast as you can, so our site doesn't explode. 

There's a ZIP file on an ftp site that has all the pics:
