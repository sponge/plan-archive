Just a quick update on a couple of things.

First, we'll be announcing a new programmer joining the
Duke team on Monday.  We're pretty excited.  It should
round us out well with a programmer focused full time on 
each major area:  Technology/Optimization, AI, Gameplay 
and Multiplayer.

Second, Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes has been released 
for the PSX and is in stores now.  We're pretty happy 
with the way it turned out and it's by FAR the best 
Duke Nukem console game to date.  n-Space did a great job.
So while you're waiting for those back ordered PS2's, run
down to your local store and check out Land of the Babes.
