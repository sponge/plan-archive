[Help!]

Ok, I screwed up bigtime.  I admit it.  And now I'm gonna have to pay for it.

I failed to sign up for a pre-order gold limited edition of Zelda for the N64.

I want one ;)  Just finished Half Life and I need something else to play.

Email me if you want to cash in and sell me your gold Zelda 64.  I'll pay you
twice what you paid for it.  Email me with offers:  georgeb@3drealms.com.
