[Shadow Warrior]

It's been a pretty productive week.  Michael has the end boss,
Zilla, just about modelled and will start on the textures and
animation by Monday.  Keith finished his last level for the most
part and has one of the coolest boss endings I've seen in a 3D
game so far.  Stephen is just tweaking his levels for framerates,
and for DeathMatch suitability.  We are net testing the levels
nightly and the screaming is starting again.  We'll get Eric's
levels on the 15th (4 levels) and finish them up, placing us
under the Aug 1st deadline for content addition.

Frank and Jim have less to do every day, and are pretty much in 
"react mode" to the few bugs we find.  A couple of things popped 
up due to >5 players, but it was just "entropy" from not 
playing >5 player games lately.  Lee has 1-2 more songs to do, 
and a minor amount of sound effects, so that's not an issue 
anymore.  We'll probably go into the studio once more to recored 
the last of the Lo Wang voices, late in the month.

I think our estimation still stands:  Finish the game and freeze
by Aug 1.  Then we simply test for hopefully a week or so, and
then send a master CD to GT for duplication.  I can see the game
ready to ship late in Aug / early Sept.

* 3Dfx support is looking good, and we're "supposed" to get a final
date for the support soon.  That means to me that they can do it,
and now it's just a race to get it ready, so we can have 3Dfx
support right when you buy SW.  Rumor has it that there "might"
be some sort of MMX support as well.

* DLL's were dropped.  Some people seem to have not gotten the news.
They were simply going to blow our deadlines, and there were one or
two technical issues still to be resolved.  All in all, we thought
shipping the game a month earlier was more important.


[Duke action figure]

Met with the company and saw some prototype sketches, sculptures,
and an actual mock up.  We're really PSYCHED.  The thing just
rocked.  I can see people all over having a Duke Nukem action
figure on their desk beating the shit out of other ones like
Spawn, Stormtrooper's, or Luke.  I know mine will be. ;)


[Duke Nukem Forever Mini FAQ]

This is sort of a mini FAQ since I keep getting the same 
questions over and over.  It also gives people something
to put on the dozens of Duke Nukem Forever sites I've
seen go up.  (Thanks for the support guys).

* We don't want beta testers.  Sorry.  If we need some
later, we'll let you know.

* Release:  "When it's done", but we think 1998.

* We will be using the Quake 2 engine, and bypassing
Quake 1.  My feeling is that after Quake 2 comes out,
the Quake 1 engine will be "old".  Also we're in a good
spot timing wise to do so, as we're just now getting 
into the main development.

* Since we are using the Quake 2 engine, you can assume
we will do what it does.  That means:
- DLL support (The game will be expandable ala Quake)
- Client/server Internet play (For free too, not just TEN)
- GL / 3Dfx support (anything Quake 2 does)
- All the neat stuff like model interpolation

* If you want to know why we didn't use the Prey engine, see 
www.3drealms.com, under About Us/Press Releases

* Yes, we will have super interactive environments like Duke 3D

* Yes, we will keep Duke's voice, sense of humor and character in
place and expand upon it.

* And finally, the most asked question so far? "Strippers?"  
Hey, it's Duke, and we're 3D Realms.


[George's Movie Review #7: "Contact"]
=====================================
Very cool flick, that I had been looking forward to since the
previews.  It's long (2.5 hours), so there are some "slow" 
spots, but I didn't mind much.  It was all pretty interesting.
There are a few hokey leaps of logic in the movie, but what
movie doesn't have them thesedays? (But it just seems that
people reviewing the script would go "Hey, this is kinda
stupid.")  Jodie Foster is good in the movie, but I keep
hearing "Nell in Space" ;)  This is definately one of the top
movies of the summer content/quality wise.  Don't expect a
high body count or any real gibs, but go see it anyway.  As 
part of your $6 donation, you get a half boob shot of Jodie,
so what the heck?  What else you gonna do.  Hang on IRC ;)
Rating: 9 / 10


[George's Movie Review #6: "Men in Black"]
==========================================
I had doubts about this movie from seeing the previews.  I expected a
rockful, "serious" sci-fi movie and that's what the early previews
indicated.  Then all of a sudden the "comical" previews started and I
was saying, "Oh, my....this is gonna suck."  Well, I'm glad to say the
movie does NOT suck, and in fact it rocks.  The casting of Tommy Lee
Jones and Will Smith is perfect.  You will constantly be laughing your
ass off, and if not, then you're just a freak.  I think with this
film, Independence Day, Bad Boys, Will Smith has secured his place as
an action hero.  Go see this movie.  It's funny, cool, and all in all
a "fun" movie.  It's probably the best movie of the summer, maybe
2nd to Jurassic Park (just from the awe factor).
