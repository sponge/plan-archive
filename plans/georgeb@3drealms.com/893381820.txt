Against better judgement, but bowing to immense team pressure here, I think
we will release a new DNF screen shot on our web site sometime tomorrow. ;)

This is the first public shot since last November or so, and a lot has
changed (like the move to 100% 16 bit source art).  I think you'll like
what you'll see.  We are still keeping 99% of the game shrouded in 
secrecy though, so don't expect too much.  Just a taste of what's to
come.
