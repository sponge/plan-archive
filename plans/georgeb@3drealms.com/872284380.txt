Slept till 4pm today ;)  Why....Cause we worked all night and shipped
out the Shadow Warrior CD's to GT Interactive today!  Wooo hooo!
They will look it over for a couple of days and if there's no issues
they will start CD production asap.  I'd expect to start seeing the 
game in stores by mid-Sept at the latest.

3Dfx Shadow Warrior:  This is going well, but unfortunately we just
couldn't hold the code back any longer.  If things go well, you might
see a 3Dfx SW patch online about the same time the game hits stores.
Currently the Build engine works about 80%, and there are just a few
things to implement, then do necessary polishing etc.

We will kick back and relax for the weekend, but we also have a major
little Duke Forever project to wrap up, so will be slamming on that 
all next week.  I cannot express in mere words how friggin' cool
Duke Nukem Forever is going to be.  I have never seen such a pumped
up, eneregized team in my life, all with one goal.  To be the best.

If controversy bothers you, please go away ;)  But I simply have to 
respond to the following.

>>> OK, Scott. Here's some accurate history. Id Software made Apogee
what it is today, and Apogee's success with Duke Nukem is a result of
shamelessly copying everything id Software does. <<<

The above written today in Dave Taylor's plan (Crack.com).

For the record, what Scott did was point out 2 minor things in some
review of Wolfenstein. 1) That Apogee was the publisher, not id. 
And that the game was published in 1992, not 1991.  Scott merely
wanted to correct the facts.  Apparantly Dave took issue somewhere
along the way.

I've been working for a week straight to get to the point we can 
burn Shadow Warrrior masters on Thursday.  I get online to relax 
and Whamo!  More hell breaking loose.  My response?  I think I'll
take a lesson from Paul Steed here and let you know how I really
feel.  I'm sure I'll get email about taking the high road.....but
when we get attacked, expect a response.  Plain and simple.

Hey Dave, ship any games lately?  Us copy everyone else?  How
about how others copy our invented way of marketing shareware 
games?  That count?  I have utmost respect for id and always have. 
Period.  End of story.  id and Apogee helped each other get where 
they are.  Both would have succeeded without the other due to 
talent alone, it just would have taken different paths.  They have
been influential in technology and genre creating, and we've been 
influential in shareware marketing (also making a lot of cool games 
along the way).  My point?  Where the hell is crack.com in all of
this?  Nowhere.  Nada.  Zip.  Duke 3D a shameless clone?  Maybe, but 
when you make a shameless clone that sells a million copies and 
raises the benchmark, and gets ported to everything but a GameBoy,
call me ok?  Until then go back to work and try to ship a game.

Hey Paul?  How'd I do?

[Shadow Warrior]

Still done.  Just awaiting bug reports from GT.  Nothing of
substance has come back, so we're looking good.  3Dfx is still
working on support.  In the meantime we just keep playing the
game, and doing a little moonlighting on Duke Nukem Forever.

Last word on Thresh vs. Anybody
===============================

Tim, over at id issued this challenge:
>>I Tim Willits bet $1.00 that Paul Steed can kick Thresh's ass 
in a good old fashioned fist fight - any takers? :)

You're on Tim!  I think that Thresh's surrvivability skills will
allow him to run circles around and dodge Paul's attacks
(taunting him all the way), until Paul either gives up in sweaty
frustration, or keels over from a heart attack.  Not only that,
but I will double, yes DOUBLE your bet to $2.  Take that.  Going
to the bank now to transfer the funds.  Might have to get a loan
for something of this amount though ;)

Heck, on second thought I don't even know Thresh, so how
dare I make a bet for him.  Let's change this to Paul Steed vs. 
um, um, A SWALLOW, yeah that's it... (African or Eurpoean 
doesn't matter).

I further bet $1 to anyone out there that the whole thing 
between Monolith and AVault was just a publicity stunt anyway ;)
Too bad Craig and Thresh got caught up in it.


[Duke action figure]

This is a "done" deal now, and we're getting a final review
sculpture soon to approve.  Looks like all you good boys and
girls will have one for Xmas after all.  ReSaurus, Inc. is doing them,
and is well known for doing some Jurassic Park dinos etc too.


[Duke Nukem Forever Mini FAQ]

This is sort of a mini FAQ since I keep getting the same 
questions over and over.  It also gives people something
to put on the dozens of Duke Nukem Forever sites I've
seen go up.  (Thanks for the support guys).

* The game will be set in and around Las Vegas, and that's
about all you're going to get out of us for the time being.

* We don't want beta testers.  Sorry.  If we need some
later, we'll let you know.

* Release:  "When it's done", but it should be in 1998.

* We will be using the Quake 2 engine, and bypassing
Quake 1.  My feeling is that after Quake 2 comes out,
the Quake 1 engine will be "old".  Also we're in a good
spot timing wise to do so, as we're just now getting 
into the main development.

* Since we are using the Quake 2 engine, you can assume
we will do what it does.  That means:
- DLL support (The game will be expandable ala Quake)
- Client/server Internet play (For free too, not just TEN)
- GL / 3Dfx support (anything Quake 2 does)
- All the neat stuff like model interpolation

* If you want to know why we didn't use the Prey engine, see 
www.3drealms.com, under About Us/Press Releases

* Yes, we will have super interactive environments like Duke 3D

* Yes, we will keep Duke's voice, sense of humor and character in
place and expand upon it.

* And finally, the most asked question so far? "Strippers?"  
Hey, it's Duke, and we're 3D Realms.
