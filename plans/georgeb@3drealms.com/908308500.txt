President, 3D Realms
Project Leader: Duke Nukem Forever
Executive Producer: Prey

In an effort to appease all the press that are contacting us, I have a brief statement.  We will not go into details as they are nobody's business but our's and the parties involved.

Paul Schuytema is no longer with us on the Prey project.  We felt a change was needed on the game.  

William Scarboro has left by mutual decision.

The partings were amicable and we wish them both well in future endeavors.

People come and go in this industry all the time.  Prey's release date is, as always, "when it's done".
