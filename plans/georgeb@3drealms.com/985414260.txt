Just finished the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo for the PS2.

There is little to be said except that this is reason enough alone to buy a PS2.  It's amazing, and it one-up's every single element of Metal Gear Solid on the PSX, then injects it all with a does of steroids for the graphics.

I finished the demo in about an hour and fifteen minutes and I'm gonna go back and play again - and see what I missed.

The MGS2 demo will appear on the Zone of the Enders disc for the PS2 later this month/early April.  Get it.

Finally...a reason to own a PS2.  Hopefully there are many more on the way.
