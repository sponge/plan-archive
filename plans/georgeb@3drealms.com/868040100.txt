Friday 7/4/97 - 2:28 pm
=======================
Well it's the 4th of July.  All that means to us is another day of
work ;)  I'll relax when I'm dead.  Right now, there's too much
work to be done.


Shadow Warrior
==============
The game is progressing at light speed.  Michael just finished the 
Sumo boss and he ROCKS!  Jim also progammed a mini-boss version of
the character with different attacks, so we have yet another 
character.  The Chick Warrior is also in and done.  This leaves 
only the main boss, Zilla to be done with characters.  Michael is
working on sketches now.  At this point art is no longer an issue
that will hold us up.  It will easily be finished by our end of July
deadline.

The maps are about done as well, and we are starting to net play them
every night.  Stephen has been working on a couple of cool deathmatch
only levels and they rock.  We see maps as being done by the 15th or
so.  Eric Reuter (outside mapper) will send us his 4 maps by the 15th,
and we will touch them up and hopefully maps are not an issue for the
end of month deadline either.

The code is also going well, and the programmer's are frankly bored at 
the moment.  Jim keeps playing Diablo ;)  We added some cool things
like boss health meters.  No longer do you have to just guess how weak 
a boss is, as you slam on him for 20 minutes.  You can now see how weak
he's getting and put that little bit of extra effort into it.  Yes,
this is a little "Nintendo-ish", but gameplay is gameplay and it's a 
definate plus. I expect to see it become standard in the future.


TEN
===
I hear that SW shareware is now live on TEN, so check it out.


Duke Action Figure
==================
Looks real promising that all you boys and girls might have a Duke
Nukem action figure soon.  We have preliminary sketches from the
toy people and a meeting on the 9th.  We're really excited about 
this.


[George's Movie Review #6: "Men in Black"]
==========================================
I had doubts about this movie from seeing the previews.  I expected a
rockful, "serious" sci-fi movie and that's what the early previews
indicated.  Then all of a sudden the "comical" previews started and I
was saying, "Oh, my....this is gonna suck."  Well, I'm glad to say the
movie does NOT suck, and in fact it rocks.  The casting of Tommy Lee
Jones and Will Smith is perfect.  You will constantly be laughing your
ass off, and if not, then you're just a freak.  I think with this
film, Independence Day, Bad Boys, Will Smith has secured his place as
an action hero.  Go see this movie.  It's funny, cool, and all in all
a "fun" movie.  It's probably the best movie of the summer, maybe
2nd to Jurassic Park (just from the awe factor).
Rating: 9 / 10


Monday 6/30/97 - 6:29 pm
========================


3Dfx Shadow Warrior
===================
3Dfx has the Build code and is looking at support.  All the legal NDA
crap is out of the way, and I hope we can add support for Shadow
Warrior right out of the box.  It's in 3Dfx's hands now, and we all
must simply be patient and wait.  But danggit Gary, hurry up ;)


Elliot Chin - Computer Gaming World
===================================
Current CGA magazine has a cute little article by Elliot Chin on 
p. 221, about how Shadow Warrior is "racist" and just an awful
game.  Methinks Elliot missed the entire point that games are
meant to be "entertaining", "fun", and stuff like that.  If our
little "parody" wasn't to Elliot's tastes, fine.  I respect that.
But he wasted 2 pages going on about the game like Satan made it.
Come on Elliot.  I guess this just goes to show that the same 
people that disliked Doom's satanic content and Duke's strippers
are still alive and well with us.  Too bad most people just like
to have a little "fun" with a game.  I mean we're not trying to 
educate the world or anything, we just make games.  I'm proud we 
at least try to break new ground in content.  I wonder if Elliot 
ever saw the humping rabbits in SW?  Maybe those were ok?


Sunday 6/29/97 - 3:29 pm)
=========================

Lot's to update here, some you will care about, some you won't. ;)

E3
==
Not much to be said here that hasn't been said, but there are
a TON of 3D action games coming out.  Seeing as how I think the 
market can support 2 (with decent sales), that's going to leave 
a lot of people holding the bag.  I simply do not think people will
buy and play more than a couple.  Let's hope they are all spread
out a little ;)  Coolest games I saw on the PC?  Quake 2 and Prey.


Duke Nukem Forever
==================
We continue to hammer on the design of the game.  We have all the
locations the game will take place in mind and are starting to 
brainstorm what will happen in each etc.  I'm really pleased with the
fact that we will build Duke Forever from a solid game spec, meaning
we'll get done faster and have a more cohesive product that Duke 3D
was.


Shadow Warrior
==============
We've set an internal finish date of Aug 1st for the game.  Then with 
a couple weeks of hard testing, we think the master will go to GT. 
Bear in mind this is a "guess" and the game will be done when it's
ready, but I think it's doable.  Michael is rendering out the new
Sumo Boss and about to start sketches for the final boss (Zilla).
Keith and Stephen have their maps basically done minus populating 
with items and enemies.  We still need to tweak and balance them, but
there are no surprises here.  All 3 new weapons are done (except we
are still tweaking the heart a little).  We are really excited to be
near the end of the project.


[George's Movie Review #5: "Face/Off"]
======================================
The movie is pretty cool.  Probably better than Broken Arrow,
although I can see them being "equal" in a lot of people's minds,
just depending on what theme you like better.  I liked the off 
the wall idea for the film, and it kinda takes you by surprise.
The movis is probably about 15 minutes too long and John Woo
once again shows more boring human interaction that slows the
film down.  Cutting this stuff out and adding more action would
have added a point to the rating.  The action scenes are good 
(but not earth shattering).  Cage and Travolta are great in their 
roles and interesting to watch.  All in all, a good action/escape 
movie for 2 hours.  Oh yeah, say an Aliens 4 preview before the
movie.  We just sat there in stunned silence.  We can only hope
those involved don't screw it up like Aliens 3.  Why don't
hollywood producers like TALK to fans and stuff about movies like
we do with games?
Rating: 8 / 10


Tyson Fight
===========
Gimme a friggin' break.  So what if Holyfield head butted you and cut
open your eye?  Kick him in the nads, or throw him to the ground, but
YOU BIT HIS FRIGGIN' EAR OFF.  There are like pieces missing and the
guy's gonna look funny now because you acted like a caveman.  What's
bad enough is that after taking a chunk outta the ear, the fight was
gonna go ON, and not 10 seconds later, you were chowing on the other
EAR!!!!  Go to McDonald's or something prior to the fight (they have
great fries).  Tyson (my favorite fighter BTW) should be banned from
the sport, lose all of his $30 million, and not allowed to fight
again.  If there is a 3rd fight (and Holyfield allows it), then all 
I can say is either Don King is the most persuasuve guy of all time,
or somebody got PAID OFF.  That fight was ridiculous.  On the other
hand....

GIBS!!! Man, cool.  We're sitting there watching the fight.  They 
were all boring as hell (except the Martin / DeSchong fight).  Nothing
like seeing two girls beat the crap outta each other.  Hey, at least 
they fight, unlike the men these days.  So we're watching the fight 
and it's looking cool and all of a sudden Tyson turns into Hanibal
Lecter in "Silence of the Ear" ;)  From that point on, it was a 
surreal experience.  We're like "Hey, did he just bite the dudes
ear off?".  Cool.  I mean we all like Holyfield and all, but here are
live action gibs on our tv in front of us.  Only $50?  Ok.


Shadow Warrior novels
=====================
Just got two manuscripts in and they, well, rock! ;)  Man, these guys
captured Lo Wang perfectly.  These are actually "fun" to read.  Bear 
in mind, this isn't top grade, sophisticated, sci/fi of anything, but
it's "fun" and entertaining to read them.  We're pretty pleased with 
the results.  We only hope the Duke Nukem author's capture Duke as 
well.


[George's Movie Review #4: "Con Air"]
Another cool film from the same producer's that brought you, 
"Bad Boys", "Crimson Tide", and "The Rock".  While not as good as 
The Rock, this movie still "rocks".  Great action, bad guys, and 
Nicholas Cage is good as always.  This one's a no brainer.  
(These guys would be a cool team to do the Duke Nukem movie I 
think).
Rating: 8 / 10


[George's Movie Review #3: "Lost World"]
Awesome special effects that cannot be missed.  Plot weaker than a 
wet paper bag.  First 20 minutes should have been scrapped or 
redone.   Kids? Don't need em?  At least in first movie they "did" 
something besides whine and be a burdon.  But the action and 
special effects make it a "must" see.  Too bad everything else
ruined a shot at cinematic greatness. No repeat value except to 
look for glitches in the effects.

[Duke Nukem Forever Info ]

This is sort of a mini FAQ since I keep getting the same 
questions over and over.  It also gives people something
to put on the dozens of Duke Nukem Forever sites I've
seen go up.  (Thanks for the support guys).

* Release:  "When it's done", but we think sometime in 
Mid 1998.

* Yes, we will maintain Quake C, so you can modify Duke 
Forever all you want?  DLL's?  Don't know, but don't count
on them.

* If you want to know why we didn't use the Prey engine, see 
www.3drealms.com, under About Us/Press Releases

* We plan on maintaing all of Quake's functionality in the free
play over the Internet.  To save some text space, since it's 
based on the Quake engine, you can assume we will keep most of 
what is already there and add to it, where we can.

* We are developing for the Quake 1 engine and will get Quake 2 at
a later date, and try to add what we can from it.  If you want
Quake 2 info...you will have to wait.

* 3Dfx?  Yes, we will maintain GLDuke, and will probably do extra
stuff for the version to make it cooler.

* Yes, we will have super interactive environments like Duke 3D

* Yes, we will keep Duke's voice, sense of humor and character in
place and expand upon it.

* And finally, the most asked question so far? "Strippers?"  
Hey, it's Duke, and we're 3D Realms.
