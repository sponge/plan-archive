* Wow, that didn't take long.  I have like 3 copies of each magazine
we were missing coming via our great fans out there.  Thanks a lot guys.
We have what we need for now, but I might do this again as soon as I
get some of the backlog of magazines we have organized.

* Had a cool BBQ/Poker party at Steve Blackburn's (VP Operations) house
last night.  Mucho fun.  Ate hamburger's and BBQ and played Poker till
5-6am ;)  Steve and Ruben Cabrera seemed to be the big winners with most
of the rest of us "donating" to them all night.  Personal note: Losing 
sucks ;)

* I see Duke Nukem 64 made the cover of a UK magazine called "Nintendo
Magazine".  They also gave the game 91% (which is one of the highest
marks I've seen from non-Nintendo developed games), calling it "far 
superior to the PC game, and it offers a great alternative to 
Goldeneye 007.  Buy it now, and have a blast."

* The final bug in the 3Dfx Shadow Warrior patch seems to have been
caught.  We need to get the code from 3Dfx to Frank Maddin, so he 
can integrate it into his version of Shadow Warrior, test a few days
and then we "should" be good for a release.  Keep your fingers crossed.

* Check out the Nov. PC Gamer for a huge story on Duke Nukem Forever.

* 3DFX Shadow Warrior - It is very close.  There is still a bug with it 
that needs to be resolved before shipping, but it should be worked out
soon.  Thanks for the continued interest and patience.

* I need some fan help out there.  I'm looking for a couple of magazines
from some time ago, and if you have copies, please email me.  Here is
what I am looking for:

- PC Gamer (UK) - Issue 25, Dec 1995 (Has Duke Nukem 3D on cover).
- PC PowerPlay (Australian mag).  Issue #3, July 1996.  Has Duke Nukem
  3D review on p46.

Woooo Hoooo!  The Duke Nukem action figure from Resaurus, Inc. is now
available for pre-orders.  It should be in stores in a few weeks.
If you're interested, visit Resaurus' site at: 

http://www.resaurus.com/dukepage1.html

Also!  Moore Creations is now accepting advance orders on the Duke Nukem 
Statue which is made of Cold Cast Porcelain (which is a bit more rugged 
than standard porcelain) and it's a limited edition of only 8,500 units.
They sell for $99.00 and pictures of the statue will be available very 
soon on the Moore Creations website at http://www.moorecreations.com,

This stuff truly rocks folks.
