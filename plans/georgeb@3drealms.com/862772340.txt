Shadow Warrior update (Friday 5/4/97 - 3:42 pm)
===============================================

Working every Saturday/Sunday for the last 3 months is starting 
to suck. (Compounded by the fact that it's a beautiful day
outside).

We're set back a little today as we're getting lotsa new hardware
for our network, like a Raid drive system.   But Kevin (or LAN
admin) swears we will be up and running prior to X-Files 
tonight.  In the meantime, we're testing the game for bugs off
our local drives.

The last 2 days saw the MOTHER of all bugs.  We had a weird sync
bug where if 2 players were in transparent water, and a third 
player triggered a certain explosion, we'd get OOS.  Frank spent
the better part of 2 days finding it, but he did so.  Then
collapsed, swearing to never work on another synchronous game
again ;)  The game is pretty stable amd the coders are just
sitting around bored, until we feed them bugs from our
testing of the game.

In other news, I was surprised when some Prey dudes walked into
my office and said "Hey, the new map guy's here".  They were
of course speaking about Matt Wood, our new mapper for Prey.
Welcome aboard Matt!  This officially puts Prey into high gear
as we have key people in every spot now.

[3D Realms Movie Review #1:]
A few of us went to see Volcano last night.  Mainly because 
going to see a movie resembled some part of the life we used
to have.  It was 'aight.  Nothing great.  Typical disaster
flick that was so ridden with cliche's it was sad, but the 
effects were pretty cool.  I haven't seen Dante's Peak yet,
but other people said they liked it better.  
Rating: 7/10 (wait for cable)


Shadow Warrior update (Friday 5/2/97 - 2:23 pm)
===============================================
As far as we're all concerned the game is done and everything that 
needs to be there is there.  We finished the shareware ending
animation last night which was the last bit of gameplay content to 
add.  Now we are on serious bug hunts.  Over the last 7-10 days we
added lot's of code to finish the game and things got de-stabilized
as usual.  Not to worry though.  The game is frozen and no more game
design features will be added.  All we will do from this point is
play test and fix bugs that occur.  I see a release in the immediate
future and will keep you all posted every couple of days.

Also, started removing some of the old Shadow Warrior updates, so this
plan won't clog up people's pages with unecessary text.

Had a nice visit from the Rogue team today, and we just sat
around talking about projects etc that we're working on.  It was 
nice to see some of the guys again, as we've been so busy lately.

I just heard from Paul Schuytema (Prey Producer) who is attending the 
Computer Game Develoepr's Conference (CGDC), that Duke Nukem 3D won 
"Best Action Game" and we got another nifty trophy.  The nominees 
were : Super Mario 64, Quake, Tomb Raider, Tekken 2, Duke Nukem 3D.  
I'd like to thank all those who voted for us.  We really appreciate 
it.
 
Also spent a good part of the day doing interviews about 
Duke Nukem Forever and responding to hundreds of user emails 
supporting us, or asking questions.  Thanks for the support and 
feedback guys.

The news is pretty nuch out that we have licensed the Quake/Quake II
engine for the next Duke Nukem game called "Duke Nukem Forever".  We
see this as an awesome deal with awesome potential.  Mixing Duke's
innovative gameplay with the amazing Quake engine should yield a
massively fun game to play.  See our web site for press releases
pertaining to this.  Here are some general answer's to common questions
I've been getting.

Q: Why license the Quake engine and not use your own Prey engine?
A: It is simply a buisness decsion and a matter of timing for us.  The
Prey engine is in good shape and the project is marching along, but we
are skipping a generation of tech with Prey and going 100% hardware
only.  By the time Prey comes out, the market will be there.  In the
meantime we wanted to make a new Duke Nukem game, and our goal is to
have it out in mid 1998.  The obvious choice was Quake.  It is
production code that is stable and out.  id Software is 5 minutes away
and we have a good relationship with them.  It seems like a slam dunk
decision.

Q: Will you maintain Quake's free play on the Internet model?
A: Yes.  Duke Nukem Forever will be on TEN, but will also be available
across the net in the same fashion Quake is.

We aren't discussing any more about the game at this time.  We have been
doing R&D and design work since December and suffice to say, we have a
fairly solid game design plan to follow.  We know what we want to do to
push Duke Nukem as a character and a game, and for the most part we know
how to do it all.  We will be posting some survey's to see what you want
in 1) a Quake engine game and 2) a Duke Nukem game.  We will then go into
a cave for the next year and work steadily on the game.  When we emerge,
you should be able to play something really cool.  The official release
for the game is, as always "When it's done".
