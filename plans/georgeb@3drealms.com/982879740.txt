In 1991 my partner Scott and I went to Shreveport to meet
with id Software about the new Commander Keen engine they 
had written.

At a small Chinese restaurant, over dinner, a simple 
question was asked of John Carmack.  We wondered how he 
was able to do such amazing things with his engines 
(back then - a smooth scrolling platform game engine was 
a big deal).

He looked up from his dinner and with all due modesty just
said: 

"Well, I like to think I'm pretty good at what I do."

We all nodded and accepted the statement matter of factly 
and went back to talking about games and eating our dinners.

That statement has always stuck with me, and I've told the
story many times to internal developers.  I feel it's
appropriate to re-tell now.

Ten years, and many engines later, it's no different.

Last night John sent a shockwave through the world of gaming
that will be felt for years.  We got a peek at Doom 3 - or
at least it's engine.

Yup, he's pretty damned good as what he does all right :)
