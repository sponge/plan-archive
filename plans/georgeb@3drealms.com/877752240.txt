WARNING!  Poop storm a coming.

Sorry, but I simply refuse to keep this in any longer.  Someone's
gonna take a stand, and it's gonna be me.  Following is yet another
little "blurb" of brilliant insight from Brian Hook's .plan file.

>>Biz guys that manage to license non-existent technology used in vaporware 
games that end up on the covers of magazines 12 months before shipping have
to be commended for doing an outstanding job.

I guess.

Some of our "competitors" have been previewed on Next Generation on-line FIVE
times so far -- still without shipping.

Smell that? That's sarcasm.
>>

I'm really sure the licensing jab was in response to Scott's mentioning
that we have several people interested in licensing Prey tech.  I'll ignore
this jab, cause hey Brian, if things weren't looking cool and progressing
we wouldn't be having licensing talks now would we?

But what REALLY burns me up is how Brian (and he is not alone at id) 
continue to take jabs at other 3D developers.  "Competitors"?  Wow,
what a way to show peers respect.  Why do this stuff?  Unreal recently
caught a major flame from Paul.  All I ever hear from (mainly 2 guys
at id) is "We rule.  Prepare to die.  Best game on earth." etc etc etc.
Hey, that's fine guys, be proud, I know we are too.  But you know, you
guys are in the best seat in the house.  You should grow up a little 
and be thankful for where you are and be above petty, weak jabs at
other people trying to get a slice of the 3D action pie.  If you are
directly attacked, sure defend yourselves to the hilt.  But going off
cause someone mentions a licensing thing, or the fact that developer's
miss ship dates is simply uncool.  And something that NEVER EVER 
happened with the "old id" that I've known since 1992.

In fact, thinking about it.  This is like the Superbowl winners saying
YOU SUCK to the loser's of the bowl.  Classy.  I mean if they really
do suck, why pick on them, and if they don't you are just being petty
and a sore ass winner.  Make sense?  Does to me.

Hey Brian, Prey as vaporware?  No.  Delayed, yes.  Gonna be a better game?
Yes.  Vaporware.  No.  Get used to it.  And I'll bet the same damned 
thing goes for Unreal and Daikatana.  I dunno when they will ship, but 
I bet they ship cool.  Late?  Yes?  Cool?  Yes?  Who cares?  Nobody but you.

Hey, BTW congrats on the Quake 2 release.  Looks pretty cool.

Also note that I have total respect for others at id namely John, Kevin,
Adrian, Tim, Christian, American etc, so don't even try to turn this 
into a company thing.

(gibbing the soap box now)

* Wow, that didn't take long.  I have like 3 copies of each magazine
we were missing coming via our great fans out there.  Thanks a lot guys.
We have what we need for now, but I might do this again as soon as I
get some of the backlog of magazines we have organized.

* Had a cool BBQ/Poker party at Steve Blackburn's (VP Operations) house
last night.  Mucho fun.  Ate hamburger's and BBQ and played Poker till
5-6am ;)  Steve and Ruben Cabrera seemed to be the big winners with most
of the rest of us "donating" to them all night.  Personal note: Losing 
sucks ;)

* I see Duke Nukem 64 made the cover of a UK magazine called "Nintendo
Magazine".  They also gave the game 91% (which is one of the highest
marks I've seen from non-Nintendo developed games), calling it "far 
superior to the PC game, and it offers a great alternative to 
Goldeneye 007.  Buy it now, and have a blast."

* The final bug in the 3Dfx Shadow Warrior patch seems to have been
caught.  We need to get the code from 3Dfx to Frank Maddin, so he 
can integrate it into his version of Shadow Warrior, test a few days
and then we "should" be good for a release.  Keep your fingers crossed.

* Check out the Nov. PC Gamer for a huge story on Duke Nukem Forever.

* 3DFX Shadow Warrior - It is very close.  There is still a bug with it 
that needs to be resolved before shipping, but it should be worked out
soon.  Thanks for the continued interest and patience.

* I need some fan help out there.  I'm looking for a couple of magazines
from some time ago, and if you have copies, please email me.  Here is
what I am looking for:

- PC Gamer (UK) - Issue 25, Dec 1995 (Has Duke Nukem 3D on cover).
- PC PowerPlay (Australian mag).  Issue #3, July 1996.  Has Duke Nukem
  3D review on p46.

Woooo Hoooo!  The Duke Nukem action figure from Resaurus, Inc. is now
available for pre-orders.  It should be in stores in a few weeks.
If you're interested, visit Resaurus' site at: 

http://www.resaurus.com/dukepage1.html

Also!  Moore Creations is now accepting advance orders on the Duke Nukem 
Statue which is made of Cold Cast Porcelain (which is a bit more rugged 
than standard porcelain) and it's a limited edition of only 8,500 units.
They sell for $99.00 and pictures of the statue will be available very 
soon on the Moore Creations website at http://www.moorecreations.com,

Been a really busy past few days.  We signed off on the MAC version of
