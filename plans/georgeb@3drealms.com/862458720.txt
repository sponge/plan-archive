Before I tell you guys what's going on with Shadow Warrior, I have a 
new addition to my .plan file.  It's called:

"TALES OF THE INSIGNIFICANT"

For the 1st installment of my new ground breaking entertainment form, 
please re-driect yourselves over to Mike Hadwin's .plan at 
http://www.stomped.com/quake/finger/mph@hipnotic.com.html.  It think 
it's damn funny and entertaining.  Wish I could be that clever, but I 
seem to have too much work to do.

Now, onto "significant" things like...

Shadow Warrior update (Wednesday 4/30/97 - 4:15 pm)
===================================================
Today is about the last content addition day we will have.  Lee got 
back from a voice session with John Galt (Lo Wang) and this should 
wrap up the voice work for the shareware version.  Hopefully by late 
tonight/early tomorrow, we will be done.  The only thing left to do 
content wise, is add ending screens, and the shareware ending 
sequence. This should also maybe be done tonight or tomorrow.  My 
plan is that we freeze code Fri-Sat, then start hammering for bugs 
only.  With any luck a release will follow shortly thereafter.  The 
team is extremely pumped up as we can smell the release and nobody 
wants to do anything but work.

I just heard from Paul Schuytema (Prey Producer) who is attending the 
Computer Game Develoepr's Conference (CGDC), that Duke Nukem 3D won 
"Best Action Game" and we got another nifty trophy.  The nominees 
were : Super Mario 64, Quake, Tomb Raider, Tekken 2, Duke Nukem 3D.  
I'd like to thank all those who voted for us.  We really appreciate 
it.
 
Also spent a good part of the day doing interviews about 
Duke Nukem Forever and responding to hundreds of user emails 
supporting us, or asking questions.  Thanks for the support and 
feedback guys.

Shadow Warrior update (Sunday 4/27/97 - 10:43pm)
================================================
The game is progressing very well.  We are all in wrap up mode, just
trying to get the code frozen so we can test the final version.  We
think it will be 4-5 days before we can have a chance of freezing code,
because there are still some things to implement in the shareware
version like the boss ending, pre-caching art/sounds, some net sync bugs
and a couple of major lock bugs.  We're having very stable net games and
can play for hours without problems at this point.  The shareware will
feature WangBang (DeathMatch), Co-Op, and Team Play (decided by color).
All these are 100% in and fully operational, as is most of the game.  We
still anticipate a shareware release within 2 weeks (putting it into
early May).

The news is pretty nuch out that we have licensed the Quake/Quake II
engine for the next Duke Nukem game called "Duke Nukem Forever".  We
see this as an awesome deal with awesome potential.  Mixing Duke's
innovative gameplay with the amazing Quake engine should yield a
massively fun game to play.  See our web site for press releases
pertaining to this.  Here are some general answer's to common questions
I've been getting.

Q: Why license the Quake engine and not use your own Prey engine?
A: It is simply a buisness decsion and a matter of timing for us.  The
Prey engine is in good shape and the project is marching along, but we
are skipping a generation of tech with Prey and going 100% hardware
only.  By the time Prey comes out, the market will be there.  In the
meantime we wanted to make a new Duke Nukem game, and our goal is to
have it out in mid 1998.  The obvious choice was Quake.  It is
production code that is stable and out.  id Software is 5 minutes away
and we have a good relationship with them.  It seems like a slam dunk
decision.

Q: Will you maintain Quake's free play on the Internet model?
A: Yes.  Duke Nukem Forever will be on TEN, but will also be available
across the net in the same fashion Quake is.

We aren't discussing any more about the game at this time.  We have been
doing R&D and design work since December and suffice to say, we have a
fairly solid game design plan to follow.  We know what we want to do to
push Duke Nukem as a character and a game, and for the most part we know
how to do it all.  We will be posting some survey's to see what you want
in 1) a Quake engine game and 2) a Duke Nukem game.  We will then go into
a cave for the next year and work steadily on the game.  When we emerge,
you should be able to play something really cool.  The official release
for the game is, as always "When it's done".
