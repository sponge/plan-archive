[DNF Stuff]

Well we finally almost have the motion capture room setup.  The ceiling 
has been yanked (so we can jump up and no hit our heads) and the stage 
will be installed tomorrow.  Then we just setup the equipment (We opted 
for the MotionStar Wireless system from Ascension), calibrate it and start 
capturing motions for the game.  The 3 animators (Chris, Allen and David) 
are in Canada now getting training on the mo-cap cleanup software we're 
using (Kaydara FilmBox).  

Chris Hargrove already has the full skeletal system in the game and it 
all works great.  A character can be doing his animations and you can 
use the bones in the skeleton to override various animations like: Have 
enemies heads track Duke's position, shoot them in the shoulder and they 
can recoil, independent things like ponytails or tails, while doing another 
animations.  

We've spent a good deal of time re-working Unreal's character system, and 
it's time for it to all start paying off.  Once you have skeletal control and 
motion capture data, putting animations in the game becomes trivial (the 
cleanup is very minor with the right software), and capturing complex motions 
like strippers becomes easy ;)

Add to this, a fully dynamic real-time LOD system for every mesh in the 
game, and you have a character system that we are very, very happy with.
