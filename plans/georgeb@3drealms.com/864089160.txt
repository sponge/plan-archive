Shadow Warrior update (Monday 5/19/97 - 9:21 pm)
================================================

It's been a week since the last update, so I 
figured it was time.  The response to the shareware
version have been pretty overwhelming, and we 
appreciate all the mail we have been getting.

V1.1 Patch - We are working on a patch right now
and I think it'll be ready sometime in the next
week.  Here are some things we are addressing.

* Save/load locks - (DOS mode mostly)
* Out of syncs
  - UZI fire (DOS mode again)
  - cheat codes that slipped through.  SWTRIX etc
* Going under water in Win95 locks (NOTE: I have
  noticed that this happens when people have an
  Ensoniq SoundSacpe. (Get a real card ;) )
* Small things like:
  - higher mouse sensitivity
  - Re-wording of 50 play message
  - Speed up start of level 3
  - Anything esle we can do in a week

Thanks for the support again, and look for a patch
really soon.

[3D Realms Movie Review #2: "The 5th Element"]
Pretty good flic all in all.  Cool, believable
world, Bruce Willis and naked Milla ;)  Starts
out awesome, but the whacky DJ guy at the end
ruined it.  Since when in the hell does Bruce
Willis need a sidekick?  Didn't they learn
from Die Hard 3?  If this movie had half the 
action of Die Hard 1/2, it would have kicked 
all ass.  As it is, it's a good movie, but it
could have been a GREAT movie. 
Rating: 8/10 (go see it, but don't expect
greatness)


Shadow Warrior update (Monday 5/12/97 - 11:55 pm)
=================================================

GOOD LORD PEOPLE!  I just checked my mail and had over
200 "Where is Shadow Warrior" messages!!??  Thanks for
the emails, but obviously I can't keep up with that 
many.  

Also, #swarrior on Undernet IRC is crawling with 
people waiting for and talking about the game. 
Drop by.

The game is DONE!  It will be uploaded sometime mid
Tuesday.  We are testing until the wee hours of the
morning, then Joe Siegler will zip, test and upload
the file hopefully around noon or so.

Enjoy...We're gonna sleep all day, then start to
work on the full version of the game.

In other news, I was surprised when some Prey dudes walked into
my office and said "Hey, the new map guy's here".  They were
of course speaking about Matt Wood, our new mapper for Prey.
Welcome aboard Matt!  This officially puts Prey into high gear
as we have key people in every spot now.

[3D Realms Movie Review #1:]
A few of us went to see Volcano last night.  Mainly because 
going to see a movie resembled some part of the life we used
to have.  It was 'aight.  Nothing great.  Typical disaster
flick that was so ridden with cliche's it was sad, but the 
effects were pretty cool.  I haven't seen Dante's Peak yet,
but other people said they liked it better.  
Rating: 7/10 (wait for cable)

Had a nice visit from the Rogue team today, and we just sat
around talking about projects etc that we're working on.  It was 
nice to see some of the guys again, as we've been so busy lately.


[Duke Nukem Forever Info ]

This is sort of a mini FAQ since I keep getting the same 
questions over and over.  It also gives people something
to put on the dozens of Duke Nukem Forever sites I've
seen go up.  (Thanks for the support guys).

[NEW INFO]

* Yes, we will maintain Quake C, so you can modify Duke 
Forever all you want?  DLL's?  Don't know, but don't count
on them.

[OLD INFO]
* If you want to know why we didn't use the Prey engine, see 
www.3drealms.com, under About Us/Press Releases

* We plan on maintaing all of Quake's functionality in the free
play over the Internet.  To save some text space, since it's 
based on the Quake engine, you can assume we will keep most of 
what is already there and add to it, where we can.

* We are developing for the Quake 1 engine and will get Quake 2 at
a later date, and try to add what we can from it.  If you want
Quake 2 info...you will have to wait.

* 3Dfx?  Yes, we will maintain GLDuke, and will probably do extra
stuff for the version to make it cooler.

* Yes, we will have super interactive environments like Duke 3D

* Yes, we will keep Duke's voice, sense of humor and character in
place and expand upon it.

* And finally, the most asked question so far? "Strippers?"  
Hey, it's Duke, and we're 3D Realms.
