Shadow Warrior update (Sunday 6/8/97 - 4:42 pm)
===============================================
We've been concentrating on the full version of 
the game.  Michael Wallin is doing some new
characters like the "Chick Warrior", and the
"Sumo".  We're hoping to have them in the game
this next week for tweaks.  We will also post
some screen shots of them in the registered 
levels.  Frank and Jim have been coding away,
and there's not any real major issues, besides
adding new characters and tweaking some 
weapons.  Along with pounding on some new bugs
and revisions since v1.1 was released.
Keith and Stephen are doing AMAZING work on
the levels, and I can promise you that they
are all the quality of the shareware levels
and beyond.  I keep waiting for these two to
collapse from over work, but instead I will
nick name them "The two energizer bunnies."
Lee is working on the redbook music.  There 
will be about 10 songs.  Half music, half
ambient.  He's got about 8 of them ready
for prime time.  We still need to record some
new Lo Wang speak.  Any suggestions from users
out there?


[Other news] 6/8/97

* Worked a little with the two Shadow Warrior
novel author's.  Explaining to them about Lo
Wang's personality and sending them CD's of 
all his speech, so they could get a handle on 
it.

* The Prey team is working hard to prepare a
demo for E3.  We are *this* close to having
characters walk around, lit, in the world.
Some guys from Cyrix, Sybex and GameSpot
were here this week and echoed that Prey was
the most amazing 3D game they'd seen so far.
We hope they are right ;)

* I did a lot of work on Duke Forever's plot
line and level progression.  We have it about
80% nailed down.  After a few group meetings 
to exchange design ideas for the levels, we'll
likely start working on "real" stuff, now that
we have direction.  Allen continues to do some
amazing "tricks" with the Quake engine, that
reminds me of the early days when he and Todd
were playing with Build.  "Wow, you can do 
that?  Wonder why nobody did?" ;)  Expect 
coolness. p.s.  My "design doc" for Duke
Forever is like 12 pages and is overtaking
my life ;) ;) ;)

* We welcomed Ruben Cabrera (artist for Duke
Forever) this week.  He's pretty cool and
comes from the now defunct Capstone/Intracorp.
Don't hold that against him ;)  His art rocks!


[George's Movie Review #4: "Con Air"]
Another cool film from the same producer's that
brought you, "Bad Boys", "Crimson Tide", and
"The Rock".  While not as good as The Rock,
this movie still "rocks".  Great action,
bad guys, and Nicholas Cage is good as alwasy.
This one's a no brainer.  (These guys would
be a cool team to do the Duke Nukem movie
I think)
Rating: 8 / 10


[George's Movie Review #3: "Lost World"]
Awesome special effects that cannot be missed.  
Plot weaker than a wet paper bag.  First 20 
minutes should have been scrapped or redone.
Kids? Don't need em?  At least in first movie
they "did" something besides whine and be a
burdon.  But the action and special effects 
make it a "must" see.  Too bad everything else
ruined a shot at cinematic greatness. No repeat
value except to look for glitches in the effects.
Rating: 8 / 10


[Duke Nukem Forever Info ]

This is sort of a mini FAQ since I keep getting the same 
questions over and over.  It also gives people something
to put on the dozens of Duke Nukem Forever sites I've
seen go up.  (Thanks for the support guys).

* Release:  "When it's done", but we think sometime in 
Mid 1998.

* Yes, we will maintain Quake C, so you can modify Duke 
Forever all you want?  DLL's?  Don't know, but don't count
on them.

* If you want to know why we didn't use the Prey engine, see 
www.3drealms.com, under About Us/Press Releases

* We plan on maintaing all of Quake's functionality in the free
play over the Internet.  To save some text space, since it's 
based on the Quake engine, you can assume we will keep most of 
what is already there and add to it, where we can.

* We are developing for the Quake 1 engine and will get Quake 2 at
a later date, and try to add what we can from it.  If you want
Quake 2 info...you will have to wait.

* 3Dfx?  Yes, we will maintain GLDuke, and will probably do extra
stuff for the version to make it cooler.

* Yes, we will have super interactive environments like Duke 3D

* Yes, we will keep Duke's voice, sense of humor and character in
place and expand upon it.

* And finally, the most asked question so far? "Strippers?"  
Hey, it's Duke, and we're 3D Realms.
