[Duke Nukem: Time to Kill in stores!]

This is a new Duke Nukem game that is exclusive to the PlayStation.  The game
was developed by n-Space and is really, really sweet.  It's a 100% original
Duke Nukem game played in 3rd person with more emphasis on action than puzzle
solving.  Duke is back with his attitude and voice intact and he's got much
alien ass to kick.  The game is rated mature and if you have a PlayStation 
and like action games and Duke, you owe it yourself to check it out.  Here 
are some links to reviews on the game:

You can also find out more on the game under the "Our Games" section on our
web site (www.3drealms.com).  I hear that EB and most other places now have
the game in stock.
