3Dfx Shadow Warrior:

Yes, we goofed.  The loading of saved games is directly our fault
and I apologize publicly to our fans.  In our zest to release the
3Dfx patch everyone "assumed" that the other guy tested mundane
features like save/load.  I take full respobsibility and we will
address it asap (I expect it is a simple thing we simply overlooked).

As to the other 3Dfx problems.  We are aware of them.  It became
obvious about halfway through the port that the speed wasn't going 
to be blazing (actually suspected it at the start).  Our options
were to blow off the port, or to proceed.  If we blew it off, we'd
have screaming fans from every corner.  At least this way, you get
something.  It's honestly about as good as the 3Dfx can do.  As
we stated in the readme, Build on 3Dfx is a major hack and several
concessions had to be made.  Speed for one.  3D Sprites/Voxels for
another.  We thought it was at least worth "trying" and see what
we'd get.  Other than the damned load bug, it's playable and
enjoyable by many.  No, you aren't going to get 50-60 fps. 

We will try to address the load bug immediately as it's an issue.

Hope everyonbe had a good Thanksgiving.  About 20 people from the
office came over yesterday and we ate till we wanted to puke,
played games and watched some movies.  A great time was had by all.

Been playing The Curse of Monkey Island.  Go buy it, as it's every
bit the classic adventure game of Day of the Tentacle, Full
Throttle, The Dig and Fate of Atlantis.  If you like adventure
games, get it.
