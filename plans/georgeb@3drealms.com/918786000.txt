Nintendo sucks.  Multi-Billionaire game company to sue two garage 
programmers for making a kick ass N64 emulator.  Nintendo should be 
hiring these guys instead of suing them.

I'm wondering what case Nintendo has here, if Sony couldn't sue
Connectix (who make the Virtual Game Station - PSX emulator), that 
will be used on the G-3 Mac's.  Unless these guys illegally obtained
code of specs from Nintendo to write the emulator, what did they do
wrong?

It's a sad, sad day when you get sued for just making a handgun, and 
not actually commiting a crime with it.
