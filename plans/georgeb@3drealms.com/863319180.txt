Shadow Warrior update (Saturday 5/10/97 - 5:47 pm)
==================================================

The game testing is going well.  We typically get a new
version, and test it for 5-6 hours, then fix the few minor
things that have popped up and start over.  We really 
aren't even touching the code now, unless it's a crash
bug or a flat our error.  The last real logic error we 
found was in Friendly Fire mode.  You weren't hurting
your buddies, but you could also walk up to a monster,
fire a rocket at point blank and you would take no
damage.  Fixed.  The current plan is to keep testing
over and over and over, getting new builds of the game
on longer anf longer intervals. If all goes well
tonight, we can make a final build with demos, test it
all day Sunday and part of Monday and "maybe" release
late Monday night, or Tuesday morning.


Shadow Warrior update (Wednesday 5/7/97 - 2:24 pm)
==================================================

Well, we've been on major bug hunts for 3 days now and they
keep coming.  All of the smaller stuff is being stomped, but
there are 1-2 major ones, we're hoping to get later tonight.
The game is really stable (never crashes or locks) and we 
haven't seen net problem in 3 days, so we feel pretty \
comfortable with that.  We're just chasing screwups and logic
errors at this point.  We added the demo loop to the game 
and that's causing a never ending stream of bugs and 
"ooops, forgot that" type things, but it's mostly resolved 
now.

Still planning on a shareware release to the net early next
week.  The critical thing will be getting things stable by 
Friday, so we can test 2-3 days and release.  I think it's
pretty doable.

Beta #4 went to our beta testing team, so we epxect them to
find their usual share of things we missed.  GT Interactive
is putting the game through their QA process as well, and
we're all just ready to get it out the door.

In other news, I was surprised when some Prey dudes walked into
my office and said "Hey, the new map guy's here".  They were
of course speaking about Matt Wood, our new mapper for Prey.
Welcome aboard Matt!  This officially puts Prey into high gear
as we have key people in every spot now.

[3D Realms Movie Review #1:]
A few of us went to see Volcano last night.  Mainly because 
going to see a movie resembled some part of the life we used
to have.  It was 'aight.  Nothing great.  Typical disaster
flick that was so ridden with cliche's it was sad, but the 
effects were pretty cool.  I haven't seen Dante's Peak yet,
but other people said they liked it better.  
Rating: 7/10 (wait for cable)

Had a nice visit from the Rogue team today, and we just sat
around talking about projects etc that we're working on.  It was 
nice to see some of the guys again, as we've been so busy lately.


[Duke Nukem Forever Info ]

This is sort of a mini FAQ since I keep getting the same 
questions over and over.  It also gives people something
to put on the dozens of Duke Nukem Forever sites I've
seen go up.  (Thanks for the support guys).

[NEW INFO]

* Yes, we will maintain Quake C, so you can modify Duke 
Forever all you want?  DLL's?  Don't know, but don't count
on them.

[OLD INFO]
* If you want to know why we didn't use the Prey engine, see 
www.3drealms.com, under About Us/Press Releases

* We plan on maintaing all of Quake's functionality in the free
play over the Internet.  To save some text space, since it's 
based on the Quake engine, you can assume we will keep most of 
what is already there and add to it, where we can.

* We are developing for the Quake 1 engine and will get Quake 2 at
a later date, and try to add what we can from it.  If you want
Quake 2 info...you will have to wait.

* 3Dfx?  Yes, we will maintain GLDuke, and will probably do extra
stuff for the version to make it cooler.

* Yes, we will have super interactive environments like Duke 3D

* Yes, we will keep Duke's voice, sense of humor and character in
place and expand upon it.

* And finally, the most asked question so far? "Strippers?"  
Hey, it's Duke, and we're 3D Realms.
