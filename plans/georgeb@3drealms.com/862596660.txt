Shadow Warrior update (Friday 5/2/97 - 2:23 pm)
===============================================
As far as we're all concerned the game is done and everything that 
needs to be there is there.  We finished the shareware ending
animation last night which was the last bit of gameplay content to 
add.  Now we are on serious bug hunts.  Over the last 7-10 days we
added lot's of code to finish the game and things got de-stabilized
as usual.  Not to worry though.  The game is frozen and no more game
design features will be added.  All we will do from this point is
play test and fix bugs that occur.  I see a release in the immediate
future and will keep you all posted every couple of days.

Also, started removing some of the old Shadow Warrior updates, so this
plan won't clog up people's pages with unecessary text.

Had a nice visit from the Rogue team today, and we just sat
around talking about projects etc that we're working on.  It was 
nice to see some of the guys again, as we've been so busy lately.


Shadow Warrior update (Wednesday 4/30/97 - 4:15 pm)
===================================================
Today is about the last content addition day we will have.  Lee got 
back from a voice session with John Galt (Lo Wang) and this should 
wrap up the voice work for the shareware version.  Hopefully by late 
tonight/early tomorrow, we will be done.  The only thing left to do 
content wise, is add ending screens, and the shareware ending 
sequence. This should also maybe be done tonight or tomorrow.  My 
plan is that we freeze code Fri-Sat, then start hammering for bugs 
only.  With any luck a release will follow shortly thereafter.  The 
team is extremely pumped up as we can smell the release and nobody 
wants to do anything but work.

I just heard from Paul Schuytema (Prey Producer) who is attending the 
Computer Game Develoepr's Conference (CGDC), that Duke Nukem 3D won 
"Best Action Game" and we got another nifty trophy.  The nominees 
were : Super Mario 64, Quake, Tomb Raider, Tekken 2, Duke Nukem 3D.  
I'd like to thank all those who voted for us.  We really appreciate 
it.
 
Also spent a good part of the day doing interviews about 
Duke Nukem Forever and responding to hundreds of user emails 
supporting us, or asking questions.  Thanks for the support and 
feedback guys.

The news is pretty nuch out that we have licensed the Quake/Quake II
engine for the next Duke Nukem game called "Duke Nukem Forever".  We
see this as an awesome deal with awesome potential.  Mixing Duke's
innovative gameplay with the amazing Quake engine should yield a
massively fun game to play.  See our web site for press releases
pertaining to this.  Here are some general answer's to common questions
I've been getting.

Q: Why license the Quake engine and not use your own Prey engine?
A: It is simply a buisness decsion and a matter of timing for us.  The
Prey engine is in good shape and the project is marching along, but we
are skipping a generation of tech with Prey and going 100% hardware
only.  By the time Prey comes out, the market will be there.  In the
meantime we wanted to make a new Duke Nukem game, and our goal is to
have it out in mid 1998.  The obvious choice was Quake.  It is
production code that is stable and out.  id Software is 5 minutes away
and we have a good relationship with them.  It seems like a slam dunk
decision.

Q: Will you maintain Quake's free play on the Internet model?
A: Yes.  Duke Nukem Forever will be on TEN, but will also be available
across the net in the same fashion Quake is.

We aren't discussing any more about the game at this time.  We have been
doing R&D and design work since December and suffice to say, we have a
fairly solid game design plan to follow.  We know what we want to do to
push Duke Nukem as a character and a game, and for the most part we know
how to do it all.  We will be posting some survey's to see what you want
in 1) a Quake engine game and 2) a Duke Nukem game.  We will then go into
a cave for the next year and work steadily on the game.  When we emerge,
you should be able to play something really cool.  The official release
for the game is, as always "When it's done".
