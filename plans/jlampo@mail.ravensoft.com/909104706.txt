 REMEMBER WHEN.......
 
 A COMPUTER WAS SOMETHING ON TV
 FROM A SCIENCE FICTION SHOW
 A WINDOW WAS SOMETHING YOU HATED TO CLEAN....
 AND RAM WAS THE COUSIN OF A GOAT.....
 
 MEG WAS THE NAME OF MY GIRLFRIEND
 AND GIG WAS YOUR MIDDLE FINGER UPRIGHT
 NOW THEY ALL MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS
 AND THAT REALLY MEGA BYTES
 
 AN APPLICATION WAS FOR EMPLOYMENT
 A PROGRAM WAS A TV SHOW
 A CURSOR USED PROFANITY
 A KEYBOARD WAS A PIANO
 
 MEMORY WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU LOST WITH AGE
 A CD WAS A BANK ACCOUNT
 AND IF YOU HAD A 3 1/2" FLOPPY
 YOU HOPED NOBODY FOUND OUT
 
 COMPRESS WAS SOMETHING YOU DID TO THE GARBAGE
 NOT SOMETHING YOU DID TO A FILE
 AND IF YOU UNZIPPED ANYTHING IN PUBLIC
 YOU'D BE IN JAIL FOR A WHILE
 
 LOG ON WAS ADDING WOOD TO THE FIRE
 HARD DRIVE WAS A LONG TRIP ON THE ROAD
 A MOUSE PAD WAS WHERE A MOUSE LIVED
 AND A BACKUP HAPPENED TO YOUR COMMODE
 
 CUT YOU DID WITH A POCKET KNIFE
 PASTE YOU DID WITH GLUE
 A WEB WAS A SPIDER'S HOME
 AND A VIRUS WAS THE FLU
 
 I GUESS I'LL STICK TO MY PAD AND PAPER
 AND THE MEMORY IN MY HEAD
 I HEAR NOBODY'S BEEN KILLED IN A COMPUTER CRASH
 BUT WHEN IT HAPPENS THEY WISH THEY WERE DEAD
