Not sure if any of the more general news pages noticed this...

There's an update zip of Heretic 2's dev toolkit available now that adds a few
missing things and fixes the path weirdness with the QE4 project file.  It also
includes a bunch of example qdt files.

Oh yeah, and there's a shot of one of the enhancement pack maps up on
www.heretic2.com if you want a look.

Anybody trying to get the "random DM start" flag on a teleporter to work should
know that you still need to target the teleporter at a destination.  The 
destination will get used in single-player, and it'll do the random thing in DM
games.

Also, a quick reminder that if you want to name your Heretic 2 map, or have a
trigger or whatever print a message, you have to use the text_msg field.
Message simply prints a line from the levelmsg.txt file (used because it's easy
to translate).

It works the same as Quake 2's message field, just a different name is all.

Anyone working on a Heretic 2 map who wants to use scripts may have noticed the
lack of a script_runner entity in the list.  Unfortunately, the included
Heretic 2 project file is told to look for *.c files, while the comment for the
script_runner is in a .cpp file (the only one in the directory).

So, find your heretic2.qe4 file (should be in toolkit/designer/hereticed), open
it in notepad, and change the line where it says:

"entitypath"            "..\..\programming\gamecode\game\*.c"

to read:

"entitypath"            "..\..\programming\gamecode\game\*.c*"

The added wildcard will make it scan that file, so script_runner will show up
in your entity list.  Apparently a number of the ent lists for other editors
are missing this entity too (probably for a similar reason), so if you
maintain one of these lists, please take a look and make sure you didn't miss
it -- scripts are central to doing a lot of the more complex stuff with a
single-player map.
