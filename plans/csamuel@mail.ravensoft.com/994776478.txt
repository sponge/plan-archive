testing, testing ... 

Well this is my first .plan update and I have a few things to say.  First of all I would like to thank 
Raven for the opportunity to work here.  No matter what bad things people might say, it is truly a great 
place to work.  Speaking of work, SOF2 is going well, we are making a lot of progress and I am sure 
people will like it.  The detail in the levels, models and art are amazing and of course the code keeps
getting better and better.  Trust me when people comment on how life like the characters, they are 
not kidding. There is something about the eye literally looking at you that makes them feel so real ... it can be creepy.

Enough of work, let me get down to what really inspired me to update my .plan file.

<a href=http://opera.redeemedsoft.com/index.htm>The Opera</a>

Before I was hired at Raven I worked on The Opera, a total conversation of the Half Life engine.  
About two years I work on this project and it was a great experience.  At first I was a level designer, 
but then the lead level designer and even helped to lead the project. In the end I wish I could have 
done a lot more for The Opera.  Before I regress any further I would just like to encourage people 
to take a look at The Opera and see it for what it is, a fun game. However please keep in mind that this 
is the <b>first</b> release and it has some bugs in it.  Then again most people who read this know how
difficult it is to create a game with few bugs.  This fact is more even more clear once you know that the 
code base for The Opera's is <i>twice</i> that of the original game, Half-Life. In any case don't fear, 
because the bugs will be squashed and everyone will be able to play to the max.  For more info check 
out the official web page for <a href=http://opera.redeemedsoft.com/index.htm>The Opera</a> and for the latest review of the game check out <a href=http://www.planethalflife.com>PlanetHalf-Life's</a>
