The point release is still in progress. We are addressing several things, among them auto downloading, mod support, cheating, and a few other things. It is moving into testing now and should be done "soon".

One area that we are working hard to improve on is releasing things for all three platforms at the same time. As we have still not released the final point releases for the Macintosh or Linux based systems, the new point release will be available in all three flavors at the same time. 







1.17.00 4:41pm
--------------
We will be releasing a point release within a week that addresses the fs_game problem that exists in the current executable. This problem forces clients to start with the same fs_game parameter as the server. It does not affect normal game play but keeps the server from specifying which "game" directory to use. This is a bug. Mod authors do not have to wait for the fs_game patch to get started as the code will be the same either way on their end. 

There are two other basic issues for mods that have come up:

1. DLL use for mods
Our position on DLL use for mods is that it is a bad thing. DLL's are not multi-os compatible and they pose a much greater security risk than qvm's. Note, I did not say that qvm's are totally secure, they are not, but they are definately more secure than DLL's. DLL's are for debugging only and qvm's are the only official supported way to produce and distribute a mod. Period.

2. Auto-downloading
We are currently exploring several options for auto-downloading. There will support at some level for mod surfing and downloading. This support is geared towards the "mod" type of add-on as opposed to downloading maps or models ( or skins ). The goal is to not consume server bandwidth for downloads but push the bandwidth use to some sort of a dedicated "mod" server or something.







1.14.00 8:12pm
--------------
The game source is out. It should start appearing on mirrors soon. It is in idstuff\quake3\source\ and named "Q3AGameSource.exe"

There is a "How to make a mod" text file included which shows the very basics of building the source for debugging ( Win32, Visual C++ ) and building the vms for distributing mods. It also shows steps to get your mod to run with the engine.

PLEASE NOTE: The game source MUST BE INSTALLED in \quake3\ off of whatever drive you like. This is so the batch files and the lcc compiler can find all the right stuff for building vm's.

The tool source and video compressor will be out next week. This will include source q3data, q3map, q3asm, q3radiant, our version of lcc and the executable for the video compressor. 



1.13.00 6:08pm
--------------
The Point Release ( Win32 version ) is out. It should start appearing on mirrors soon. 

The three primary fixes in this version over the 2nd beta are:

-crash when bots chat on dedicated servers
-crash when bots chat under linux
-bots no longer "keep" trying to score after they respawn if they died carrying the flag




1.11.00 7:01pm
--------------
The 2nd Point Release Beta (version 1.15b) for Quake III Arena is out. It should start appearing on mirrors soon. This version contains several bug fixes and should go final within a day or so. The source should be available shortly after that ( within a few days ). Per usual, all dates and time frames are subject to change.

Changes:
-Control menu works properly
-Pure server connection notification
-2D Armor icon appears properly
-.arena files are accumulated properly across pk3 files
-A few other smallish fixes




12.22.99 8:30pm
---------------
I have placed a new install for the tools on the ftp site. Our ftp gets hammered but it should show up mirrored pretty quick as well. 

ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/tools/Q3ToolSetup_Dec221999.exe

There are quite a few changes, see the readme for a list.

This release contains new content or updates for the following:

-Q3Radiant, this is named 'Q3Radiant_181.exe'. This will allow you to revert to the older version in case there are unforeseen problems.
-Q3Map, some fixes.
-Q3Data, see the Modeling manual which was put together by Paul Steed and Paul Jaquays.
-Model_manual_ps.doc, the above mentioned model manual.
-bspc - see the included text file for changes.
-Museum.map, Museum.shader - A map done by Kenneth Scott to illustrate a wide variety of shader effects. Cool stuff.
-MapMedia.pk3 - additional content required by the museum

The museum takes quite a while to light when running Q3Map on it. Be patient :-)






12.16.99 2:38pm
---------------
I should be releasing an update to the editor soon. There are a few outright crashes I have fixed and I am looking into some other issues. If you are seeing stability problems, it is more than likely a driver issue. I am doing what I can to get these resolved. 

We are seeing quite a few reports of fullbright levels when you preview new levels in the game. If you are having this problem can you drop an e-mail to tools@idsoftware.com along with your video configuration and whether or not bringing the console down solves the problem ( press ~ to bring down the console and see if the level lights ).

We will also be re-releasing the .shader files soon. The .shader files in the shipping PK3 and the ones I included in baseq3/scripts include a lot of unused ( and in many cases non-functional ) shaders that are left over from the entire project. We are going to trim that down to the actual shaders used in the game.

'q3data.exe' will also be in the update which will allow you to convert ASE's to MD3's. This should help getting new player and map models in the mods.




12.15.99 1:10am
----------------
A small update. To build a map, q3map requires that 'quake' exists somewhere in the path. It uses this to derive the base path to figure out where to find things. What this means is that if you installed Quake III Arena ( and the tools ) to 'c:\q3' then q3map will fail with a < SetQdirFromPath: no 'quake' in C:/Q3/baseq3/maps/unnamed.map > error. I realize this can be somewhat of a pain but it is the way the tools work ( it is also the way the tools have always worked ). 

If you installed the game and the tools to the default or the name you chose has quake in it then this will not apply to you. If you installed to a path that does NOT have 'quake' in the name you will need to rename it to get q3map to work properly.



12.14.99 11:40pm
----------------

The editor and tools are now available, the install can be found at ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/tools/q3toolsetup.exe. They should also appear on Quake3World soon.

The readme contains a LOT of information, make sure you peruse through it after installation. You MUST install the tools to the same path as Quake III Arena. This will allow the editor to just work ( or it should ). If you installed Quake III Arena to c:\Program Files\Quake III Arena\ then make sure you install the tools to c:\Program Files\Quake III Arena\

These are unsupported tools. Even so, you may e-mail questions and problems to tools@idsoftware.com. I cannot guarantee a reply or a fix but I will try to address major issues.

The source code for the editor, q3map, related tools and the game will be available soon. I do not have an ETA yet but it should be in the not too distant future.

As far as hardware required to run the editor, here is how testing went for us. All testing was performed on a P2-300 with 64 mb of ram and Win98. Testing was done with the GLSetup drivers in most cases, but we grabbed the latest reference drivers if problems showed up. NT 4.0 will probably provide different results. I will be working with the vendors to try and get the problems worked out with the drivers and/or the editor. 

TNT1 - Runs well.
TNT2 - Runs very well.
GeForce 256 - Smokes :-)
Riva 128zx - Runs ok, slow but usable.
ATI Rage 128 - Runs very well.
ATI Rage Pro - Runs sort of, not usable.
S3 Savage 4 - Editor crashes.
Matrox G200 - Editor crashes.
Matrox G400 - Editor crashes.
3DFX Banshee - Ran the editor. No grid in XY Window but appeared ok otherwise.
3DFX Voodoo3 - Ran the editor. No grid in XY Window but appeared ok otherwise.
Intel i740 - Ran very well.


The readme has a list of the latest changes.




12.10.99 09:02pm
----------------

A couple of things. First, things look like they are still good to go on getting the editor and map building tools out early next week. I am shooting for Tuesday sometime but that can change based on a variety of things. In any event it should be soon. Secondly, the editor and shader manuals will not be available right then but will follow shortly after. The shader manual probably within a few days of the tool release, the editor manual a bit after that. 

At this point, the tools should ship with three sample maps ( all from the game ) and the additional shader textures and "mapobject" models required to build those three maps. The maps represent a nice cross section of shader and entity functionality for everyone to digest. 

We have been using a P2-300 running Win98 with a variety of cards for testing. To produce a production level map ( full vis and -extra light ) it takes 36 minutes for Q3DM1. Fast vis and normal light takes about 4 minutes on the same map. That should give some idea on requirements but your results will vary.

As always, everything here is subject to change ( timing and content ) but this is the current plan and I do not foresee any changes.


Recent changes to the tools.

12.07.99 05:02pm
----------------

The editor and map building tools should be available in about a week. This will include a prebuilt editor, q3map, and additional support files to get you going with map design and construction. There will also be some sample maps and shader examples. 

I'm in the process of running the editor against various GL configurations and making sure it runs well on Win98 machines. I'll post a list of confirmed GL setups that I found to work, with the release. If it runs on a driver set installed by GLSetup I'll call it good. 

The tool and game source will follow sometime after this release. A few things still need done in that area but it should follow reasonably soon after the binaries.

The "about a week" time frame estimate is just that. An estimate.
