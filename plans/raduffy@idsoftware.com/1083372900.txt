Updated setups for Q3 Linux 1.32 and RTCW Linux 1.41 are available in the anonymous ftp ( ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com ) and on the BitTorrent tracker ( http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/BT/ ).

6eb06cb2c21f075f8cd63901d43ba7a3  linuxq3apoint-1.32b-2.x86.run 6edf02471da704ad4e9e365e474bcbc8  wolf-linux-1.41-2.x86.run

IMPORTANT: This is NOT a new release, this is an update of the installer code to fix recent bugs related to text mode installation on glibc 2.3 systems. If you already have Q3 1.32b or RTCW 1.41 working on Linux, you don't need to download, the game binaries are strictly the same.




November.21.2002
----------------
There is a new Linux Q3A 1.32b on the ftp. This is Linux client side only and is fully compatible with 1.32

Changes:

- Text mode install broken on glibc 2.3 (Debian Sid) http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=165358
Current Debian Sid's glibc package break backwards compatibility with binaries compiled on older glibc and statically linked. This will cause the text mode setup to segfault.

For now you can either:
 - find a solution to run the graphical gtk-based setup
 - roll back to glibc 2.2
 - use an updated setup binary:
   run the linux setup once, with the --keep option
     (this will exand all the files to setup.tmp/)
   get this updated setup file:
     http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/linux/165358/setup
   replace setup.tmp/setup.data/bin/Linux/x86/setup by the new one
   cd to setup.tmp/ and run setup.sh 


- Current NVidia drivers don't officially support glibc 2.3 systems This affects Debian Sid in particular, causing crashes during vid_restart The issue is related to the SMP build depending upon libpthreads 1.32b has both SMP and non-SMP binary. Use quake3-smp to launch the SMP version if you want to use it.


- SMP and non-SMP builds:
Default quake3 shortcut will spawn a non-SMP build. Use quake3-smp for an SMP-enabled run. From the feedback we got after the 1.32 release, 
the SMP support as designed in the Quake III Arena technology isn't so much relevant anymore. It was designed for much lower CPU frequencies and lower AGP throughputs. Modern systems won't benefit from SMP. Since it didn't make much sense to remove the SMP binary, we have both now.


- Fixing broken mouse on Suse:
Starting with XFree 4.2, the event timestamps returned by the X server 
are no longer matching gettimeofday. And there is currently no API in X 
to provide easy synchronisation. 1.32 introduced improved event timing 
by correcting event time with X server event timestamp (sub-frame timing). This worked fine with XFree 4.1, and no longer does. 1.32b adds a safe check to work again with XFree 4.2, but basically the input timing is back to 1.31 quality.

Some new cvars related to the mouse control:
in_dgamouse - not new, but be sure to have it set to 1 on any recent system in_subframe - completely disables sub-frame timing. If XFree 4.2
  in_subframe 1 won't hurt, but it won't do anything either.
in_nograb   - for mod developers. Set to 1 and run windowed, Q3 won't be
  grabbing your mouse pointer (useful for debug breaks)

The Quake 3 Arena and Quake 3 Team Arena sdk's are up on our ftp.

In idstuff/quake3/source

Win32 - Q3A_TA_GameSource_132.exe
Linux - linuxq3a-sdk-1.32.x86.run




October.7.2002
--------------

The new Quake 3 Arena and Quake 3 Team Arena point release is up. Thanks to Timothee for getting all the fixes in and Tony and the crew at Even Balance for getting Punk Buster support in. A beta version of the Mac point release will be up soon but it will not authenticate properly with Punk Buster for a couple of weeks. 

The release should be appearing on mirrors soon but here are the locations on our ftp. The auto-update system is also updated so you can auto-update or grab it here.


ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/win32/q3pointrelease_132.exe
ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/linux/linuxq3apoint-1.32.x86.run

Here is a list of the general updates/fixes. 

CHANGES 1.32


General:

- new network protocol, 68

- network code:

  improved fragmented messages handling

  map change while client loads map no longer causes an 'Invalid .PK3' error

  map_restart while client loads map no longer causes a reload

  fixing donedl being ignored after autodl if map_restart'ed

- the demo command has a list of compatible protocols, it will loop through 66 67 68

  you can do '/demo four' and it will try four.dm_66 four.dm_67 four.dm_68

  or you can explicitely give a '/demo demoname.dm_??'

 

- added mousewheel support in the console: 

  wheel to scroll, ctrl+wheel to scroll faster, shift+wheel to scroll history

 

- UI in baseq3/ and missionpack/ for PunkBuster configuration

  punkbuster server in server creation dialog (sv_punkbuster)

  punkbuster client in server browser (cl_punkbuster)

  added PB Yes/No to the browsers

- removed obsolete MPlayer UI stuff

- bumped server browser to handle up to 4096 servers

 

- IP maintained in userinfo

- cl_guid in userinfo (as part of PB integration)

- printing ports as unsigned ints, no longer printing negative port numbers

- cleaned up the legacy IP banning code

  use * for IP pattern matching now instead of 0 (fixes some confusion)

    ex: 192.246.12.*

  made it safe from overflowing and crashing

  NOTE: using PunkBuster's banning system is advised instead though

- rcon: some fixes to the buffering to avoid overflowing and dropping parts of the message 

- rcon: now supports quoting /rcon g_motd "foo bar"

- added SVF_CLIENTMASK (0x00000002), works only with <= 32 players

      set bitmask of players to which send entity

- pushed cl_maxpackets upper limit to 125

- added [skipnotify] from RTCW, use to display in the console only, but not on client screen

      (also fixes pb_msgprefix and pb_sv_msgprefix)

 

- new cvar sv_lanForceRate (defaults 1):

  forces LAN clients to the maximum rate instead of accepting client setting

  (1 is the default behaviour, backward compatible)

 

- new cvar sv_strictAuth (defaults 1):

  server side variable to control wether strict CDKEY auth should be performed with the auth server

  this is required if you want reliable cl_guid for the server (for users tracking)

 

- filesystem:

  client re-orders it's pk3s according to the order given by server

  (fixes some 'Invalid .PK3 files referenced' situations

 

- fixed invisible entities/players bug (thanks goes to Rick Johnson / Raven for this one!)

- update x86 VM code (better and safer optimisations) (Richk Johnson / Raven too)

- clearing client gentity before GAME_INIT call

- failing vote if there's only one voting client (fixes exploit on 2-player server where one player votes then disconnects, forcing vote to pass)

 

- added trap_FS_Seek

 

- renderer fix:

  if client game code registers a shader after drawsurfaces are generated but before frame is rendered

  had a one-frame visual glitch (shader indexes messed up)

- renderer fix:

  r_roundImagesDown 0 + map q3dm1 -> crash (buffer overflow fix)

- renderer fix:

  fixed a crash in widescreen displays (q3dm11)

- rcon:

  fixed rcon not working on NT/2000/XP workstations that have a long uptime

 

Linux specific:

 

- no longer trying to load libMesaVoodooGL.so

  obsolete code, was confusing when trying to setup correct OpenGL acceleration

- SMP support in the renderer. Detects CPU count, r_smp 1 default if available. (thanks to Gareth Hughes for contributing this)

- changed default GL driver from libGL.so to libGL.so.1

  see LSB 1.2 spec: http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/refspecs/LSB_1.2.0/gLSB/libgl.html

- Handle Ctrl and Space key together correctly (Ctrl was disabling Space)    

- sub-frame timing of input events (key/mouse) (input timing quality now equivalent to win32)

 

 



July.29.2002
------------

Just a quick note on future releases for Quake 3 Arena. We will be releasing a new point release in the relatively near future which includes a handful of fixes and updates and also includes full Punk Buster integration to combat cheating. No firm date on when this will be out but it should not be too far off.






March.16.2002
-------------
Timothee has the Linux Wolf 1.3 update ready, it is on our ftp under wolf/linux/wolf-linux-1.3.x86.run  Enjoy.





Jan 19.2002

To clear up a bit of confusion, what we released yesterday was the level editing tools and not the full SDK for Wolfenstein. Everything is there to create both single-player and multi-player maps. Also included is Escape ( from single-player ) and Beach ( from multi-player ) for reference.

The source code will be available soon.

Somewhere out there I am sure a 3DFx Glide 2 SDK exists. I am in need of one if anyone has the original download let me know. I'm also looking for the latest Glide 3 SDK but can do without that. Thanks!




Nov.5.2001
------------

The Wolf MP Test 2 client installs for Linux are now available ( Thanks to TTimo ). THe smaller version does NOT have media so you will need the Win32 setup if you get it. The larger version has everything you need. 

Grab them here ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/wolf/linux/









Oct.21.2001
-----------

The Q3A Master Server will be back up ASAP. We are having some issues with the hardware at the moment. 




Sept.22.2001
------------

The client installs for Linux are now available. THe smaller version does NOT have media so you will need the Win32 setup if you get it. The larger version has everything you need. 

Grab them here ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/wolf/linux/





Sept.16.2001
------------

The dedicated Linux server installs for Linux are now available. THe smaller (2 MB) version does NOT have media so you will need the Win32 setup if you get it. The larger (65MB) version has everything you need. In general server commands are very similar to Q3A if not identical. 

Grab them here ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/wolf/linux/






Sept.15.2001
------------
It appears that GameSpot did not update to the latest build we sent them. The correct file is WolfMPTEST0915.exe.

Both versions will work but you will want the later one for some compatibility, performance and other issues.




Wolf Notes.

I thought I'd share a bit of information about the Wolf MP Test. Basically some strategies and techniques we use around here.

The key to Wolf MP is teamwork, you need good class balance to perform the objectives. There is no health on the map, and no ammo either. You will need a Medic to supply health and a Lieutenant to supply ammo. Here is a quick run down on some stuff. More info is in the readme that will accompany the test but this will get you started. Wolf MP was designed to have friendly fire on, you can turn it off but it is much more fun on. 

All classes carry a knife, pistol, 2-handed weapon, grenade(s).

Soldier - Can carry any two handed weapon. ALL classes are limited to one 2 handed weapon at a time. You can drop your weapon and pick up a different one. When you are wielding one of the heavier weapons, Venom, Panzerfaust, you move sllloooww.. but you can move at normal speed if you have your knife or pistol out.

Engineer - Carries half the normal ammo initially can pick up more but starts out with half. Carries dynamite and tools, can defuse dynamite and fix the MG42 mounted guns. 

Medic - Carries half the normal ammo initially and only 1 grenade. Can produce health packs based on the charge bar. All the class charge bars are on the right of the hud, the left hand bar is stamina. Also carries a syringe ( with 5 charges ) that can revive fallen comrades. You will see a revive icon over them if it is possible. When you die you can choose to go straight to limbo ( press jump ) or wait for a medic. PAY attention to the reinforcement timer on the scoreboard so you know when to jump to limbo.  Medic's also give a health bonus to your team up to 120, just having 2 medics alive on your team means you spawn in with 110 health instead of 100. Medics are your friend.

Lieutenant - Carries smoke grenade which calls in an airstrike, ammo pack ( recharge system like the medic ) and binoculars for calling in artillery. The latter is particularly useful for erradicating enemy snipers that are hard to find. 

You can change classes when you are in limbo and/or change weapons as a soldier. This is important as roles evolve based on what is going on during the game play. 

If you are on the allied team, initially you are going to need an engineer, some snipers, a medic to help get the engineer up the beach. Once you have blown the door and the wall you do not need any more engineers unless you just like blowing stuff up in a major way. If you can capture the forward spawn point in the bunker you will mostly reinforce in there so at this point snipers become less critical. You will want soldiers and at least one medic and lieutentant. It is usually a fight down to the war room and then up to the radio room. 

The axis team is going to want a lieutenant and a sniper or two to start out with. You will want to man the MG42's ASAP so you can chew the beach up and keep the door and wall up as long as possible. You can even get sneaky and have an engineer jump over the wall to defuse the dynamite if you can keep him covered well enough. Once they are inside the base you will want keep a group in the war room and in the radio room. A medic is handy near the radio room to keep people alive during the last push. A good Axis sniper can dominate the beach in the beginning.

That is just a taste of what is coming your way from a game play perspective. The map is even fun one on one you just have to change classes to win! 

Oh yeah, USE the SPRINT key, it is really helpful getting your butt outta bad places. Also don't forget the voice chats, called "Quick" chat in the menu system.

For server ops the .script file in the maps directory ( outside the pak file ) contains mission time etc.. 8 Minutes is a good place to start. 


Have fun!

QCon 2 on 2 SMACK DOWN.

Last year Tim and I had an open challenge in the nVIDIA booth in 2 on 2 CTF. The prizes were T-shirts for the winners. We only lost one out of about 25 matches. This year, we have some great prizes as we figure it is time for us to whip everyone's
