Looks like some rumor control is in order here. I didn't expect
the news of my departure to get outside of Raven/Activision for 
a while.  I've already received many e-mails from people wishing 
me well, and I'm really touched by the response.  

Yes, the rumors are true. In fact, today is my last day. I am 
leaving for reasons entirely unrelated to Raven. In fact, they 
have been extraordinarily great to work with. I wish them all 
the best on their future projects and have nothing but the 
deepest respect for their talents and discipline. It's been an 
honor and a pleasure working with them for the past two years. 

So, where am I going?  I am leaving to take a position with 
Electronic Arts in Seattle as a Producer. It's a great 
opportunity for me that is more in line with my long term goals. 
Seattle is a great town, and I look forward to living somewhere 
with a little weather now and then. =) 

Finally, I want to thank the Raven/Quake community for their 
support of our products.  You guys have been absolutely great; 
supportive and passionate.  Decidedly passionate.  Take care, 
all, and keep pushing us production types to make better games!



Oh, and my departure before the release of the EP is entirely
coincidental.  The EP is still in the final, final stages of
testing and will be handled on my end by John Tam.  Everything
is still going along fine with the EP and it should be out...
repeat after me, everyone..."when it's ready!"  =)
