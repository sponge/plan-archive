Just to let everyone know, we're still pounding on the EP.  The
code still has a few bugs, and we're doing our best to test the
game thoroughly before releasing it.

I understand that many of you have been waiting for the EP for 
quite some time, but the simple fact is that it's not ready yet.
I certainly empathize with everyone's dismay at how long this has 
taken; trust me, no one wants this out more than we do.  But it 
has to be right.  

We've all been burned in the past by buggy software released 
prematurely.  I don't want that to happen here.  Not on my watch.

Questions?  Comments?  Flames?  =)

<h3>More on DirectX 6.1 and Heretic II</h3>
Just to follow up on my player advisory from Feb 3, we've been 
looking into reports of DX6.1 incompatibility with <em>Heretic II</em>.
We have yet to find a replicable incompatibility with DX6.1 and 
<em>Heretic II</em>.  

Incompatibility with DX6.1 for <em>Heretic II</em> is unlikely in
any event.  Ht2 uses only one component of DirectX called 
DirectSound.  This component, when present, allows us to access
your sound card through this abstraction layer.  However, if 
DirectSound is absent from your system, the game defaults to a 
built-in sound engine.

Ht2, as you know, uses OpenGL, and in some cases a specialized
OpenGL driver that resides in your Heretic II folder.  Therefore,
it is extremely unlikely that the problems you may be 
experiencing since you installed DirectX 6.1 cannot be fixed 
with driver updates or driver reinstallation.  

As always, make sure you have downloaded and installed the
latest certified drivers from your hardware manufacturer.  Nine
times out of ten, this will solve your problem.

Many thanks to Stephanie and Vangie for having me on <a href="http://www.allgames.com/index.asp?showid=84">Lilith and Eve</a>
tonight.  If you haven't checked out L&E, you should definitely do
so.  The show rocks.  

A note on the player advisory I issued a week or so ago:  we've
been tracking down reports the DX6.1 doesn't work and play well
with Heretic II.  Fortunately, we've been unable to recreate the
reported problems here in our QA.  So I'd say it's okay to upgrade.

Of course if you do encounter problems, ignore the paragraph above. =)
No, really, if you do encounter problems, be sure to <a href="mailto:sstringer@activision.com">e-mail me</a> and 
let me know so I can update my .plan file accordingly.

<h3>Player Advisory</h3>
evil avatar just e-mailed us with a post warning that Heretic II
players <em><strong>should not</strong></em> download and install DirectX 6.1.  
There are reports that DX6.1 is incompatible with Ht2.

We're looking into it, and I'll report more when we find out.

Here's the full post:

     Agn3D is reporting that DirectX 6.1 is once again available
     for download <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wuother/directxfoundation/default.asp?site=95&gt;">Here</a>.  I would caution people against downloading
     DirectX6.1 since it is known to have severe incompatibilities 
     with certain games. I have talked with people who have found 
     that they cannot run games like Rogue Squadron, Heretic 2 and 
     even Quake 2 after installing DirectX 6.1.
