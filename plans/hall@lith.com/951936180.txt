Quick update:

I was recently contacted by a website that requested an interview of me. The site explained that it would be great if I could take the time to help them out. I saw no reason as to why I shouldn't, so I did.

After I answered the interview questions I THEN went to the site to see what kind of site I was responding to. Much to my pleasure I found a really cool site, with a lot of recent and interesting interviews already up.

The site somewhat departs from the classic game-news format and I think that it really adds some uniqueness. Anyhow, if you are interested and have the time, I recommend that you check it out. 

The link is:

http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/cottages/hypothermia/

and they have interviews with people like:

Billy "Wicked" Wilson
Aurora from GameGirlz
JCal from Stomped
Etc.

It's pretty casual and has some interesting perspectives.

The interview I did is located at:

Hopefully, more development people will want to do some great interviews, and we all can get to know more about each other (except for the 3 minutes we see everyone at GDC and E3)...
 
Anyhow, I want to with Steven Lynch the best of luck with his site! He is off to a great start.
