  Well, a mixed bag of news this time. I'll just dump it
all on you and let you sort out which is "good" and which
is "bad".

  I'm hip-deep in mission scripting for TRIBES Extreme now.
Jesse Russell did the scripting for two of the training
missions before moving on to campaign scripting, and I'm
doing the others. I think it's going pretty well so far, I
have about 80% of them in a good "first pass" state, and Scott
"Cap'n America" Rudi is providing feedback and tweaking the
text. The training missions for Extreme look like they're
going to be much more comprehensive and "event-based" than
the original TRIBES ones -- Greg had very little time to put
those missions together, and I think he did an amazing job
with them when you consider just how little time he had.

  As a consequence of the head-down, full-on assault on the
training mission scripting, Freeze has been put on hold for
now.  There are still several problems with it, and I would
dearly love to get it finished and released, but it's strictly
a "free time" project. Hopefully I'll be able to get back to it
before too long.  My apologies to anyone who's been waiting for a
Freeze release (if there is anyone).

  I would like to encourage everyone who hasn't done so recently
to visit the TRIBES Extreme area of the website
(http://www.tribesplayers.com/tribesplayers/extreme-index.html)
and give a look at what we've been working at so hard lately.
There's information about the game, screenshots, witty bon mots,
and more stuff on the way. It's more fun than you can shake a
barrel of monkeys at, or something like that.
