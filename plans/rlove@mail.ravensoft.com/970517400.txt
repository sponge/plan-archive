I was just sonically assaulted by the oddest rap group in the world :

The Backward Boys starring :

Eric Biessman
Rick Johnson
Jim Hughes
Matt Pinkston

and 

Jeff Lampo as Fly Boy


They stormed by my office and performed the worst rap music 
I've ever heard (which, considering my feelings towards rap, 
really says how cosmically bad they were).


I have to leave now and go for counseling.

The horror . . . the horror . . .
