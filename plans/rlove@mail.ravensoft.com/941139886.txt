Just had this conversation with Jake Simpson.  I think it went rather well.


Jake: I saw what you wrote about me in your plan file and your bloody well lucky 
I don't get violent.

Me: Sorry, mate. Uh, what do you say we throw another shrimp on the barby?

Jake: You twit - that's Australian, not British.

Me: Okay, how about we go have a beer after work and you can tell me all about  
    the beautiful sights of England like the Taj Mahal and the Eiffel Tower?

Jake: Go away.

Me: And aren't there some pyramids over there too?

Jake: Now would be the best time for you to go away.

Me: Yeah, well . . . G'day!

Jake: You really don't get it, do you.

Attacked again by my good friend Jake "British and proud of it" Simpson in his plan file.  
Well I wasn't going to tell this but here's an actual conversation I had with Jake the
other day.


Me: Hey, Jake, hows it going?

Jake: Top.

Me: Huh?

Jake: Top.  Well, not completely top.  The blighter who lives next door to me drives 
a lorry and when he starts it up early in the morning it bloody well wakes up the entire
neighborhood.

Me: Blighter ??? . . . Lori ???

Jake: Yeah, he's a real curb crawler.

Me: You're talking British at me again.

Jake: Bloody well right, mate.

Me:  I forgot my British to English dictionary.  Let me run back to my desk.

Jake: Never mind.  I gotta go to the loo.  We'll talk later.

Me: Who's Lou?

Jake: Cheers.

Me: What?

As it turns out I made several errors in my update yesterday :

Donald Pleasence is in fact dead.  He died in 1995 and he is still dead, as far as I know.  But I can still wish him a happy birthday, can't I? (Thanks, Jeremy Devers)

It is in fact 88 days and one year until the end of the century.  (Thanks, MRJ and Joonas Ahonen)

Also, Montana did not recently secede from the United States.

And Beanie Babies to not cause massive nose warts.

My apologies for any inconvenience these misstatements might have caused.

If you get a chance, go to Navy Pier in Chicago and see the IMAX show "The 3D Experience" -
it is amazing.  I think I pulled a muscle dodging things coming at me.  Very, very cool.

And happy birthday to Donald Pleasence (1919).  He played Doctor Loomis 
in Halloween, the President in Escape from New York, and 007's nemesis Ernst
Stavros Blofeld in You Only Live Twice.

And by the way, only 88 more days till the end of the century.

Today the moon is blown out of Earth's orbit by a bunch of nuclear waste 
stored there.  The moon will wander through the galaxy and meet up with 
many odd aliens.  

At least that's how it happens in Space : 1999

Been a while since my last update.  Where to begin?

First off, SOF is really going to knock you out.  Just you wait and see. It
keeps getting better every day.

About StartCraft, things there are good also.  Last week we had four games.  I was on
the losing team for the first game (me and Eric Turman).  But then the gods smiled down 
upon me and my teammate.  The second game I was able to hold Brian Raffel and Brian Shubat
off long enough for Eric Turman to get his mighty Protoss fleet built.  After that I just
watched the big scouring pad of carriers wipe out town after town.  For the third game,
Brian Shubat and I teamed up as Zurgs and beat the Protoss scum before they knew what hit
them.  For the fourth game (yes, we play alot) the Zurgs once again stepped on the Protoss
and crushed them like paper cups.  It was very satisfying.

About the Sci-fi/Horror/Fantasy webzine, that is coming along quite nicely.  Rob Gee has
been kind enough to put the site together.  We have some very good submissions but we're
always looking for more - so if you're a writer or an artist, send us your stuff.  We hope
to have our first edition out the end of this month. 

Send horror works to Eric Biessman at ebiessman@ravensoft.com
Send fantasy works to Kenn Hoekstra at khoekstra@ravensoft.com
Send sci-fi works to Robert Love at rlove@ravensoft.com


And lastly, Christian Slater and Steven Segal are still terrible actors and John
Denver is still dead.

Sounds like we were very well received in Gen Con. 

Goodbye to MST3K - it was a good show and it will be missed.

And if you get a chance go and see "The Iron Giant" it was a great movie.

Submission Guidelines for yet-to-be-named webzine :


Writing :

We want short stories in the horror/fantasy/sci-fi vein.  Size doesn't 
matter (at least in this case) so make the story whatever length it needs to be.  
Other than that we have no real criteria - just make it good.

Send us your story via email in some format that can be read by Word 97.  So Word, Works, 
Word Perfect, or flat ascii would be fine.


Art :

Send us a scanned image (in jpg format) of your horror/fantasy/sci-fi artwork and you 
could be a featured artist or have your work shown with several other artists.


Details :

Send horror works to Eric Biessman at ebiessman@ravensoft.com
Send fantasy works to Kenn Hoekstra at khoekstra@ravensoft.com
Send sci-fi works to Robert Love at rlove@ravensoft.com

Response time may be a little slow but we will get back to you as quick as possible 
on whether your work has been accepted or not. 

Rights to accepted works will be retained by the artist.

Oh, and about money; we don't make any doing this so neither will you - sorry.
