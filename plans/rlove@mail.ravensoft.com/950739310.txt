Man, you put a little bit of effort into something and someone just has to give you a 
hard time. (Read Brian Raffel's finger update.)

Okay, so maybe Andy Trabbold has been doing pretty much nothing but generating LCAR
graphics for the menus for the last four weeks . . . we want the menus to look like 
something you'd see if you were actually on Voyager.  They're full of cool stuff thanks
to all the input from the many Star Trek fanatics on the project. For instance, I set the 
opening screen up with a bunch of labels that automatically brighten up and display data. 
I was immediately cornered by Rob Gee and Kim Lathrop who demanded I make it 
so you can click on the labels and get the descriptions rather than waiting for it to 
automatically cycle back. (This happened right after Brian Pelletier asked 
the same thing)   So I added that . . . but I had to add it to the other screens
that had labels. And they just keep getting more complex as time goes on; another row
of numbers here, another blinking graphic there.

As Steve Raffel put it - they're not just menus, their events!

(That's a good thing . . .right?)


And remember, Brian Raffel, revenge is a dish best served with a salad and a baked potatoe
smothered in sour creme.

Gene Roddenberry was born today in 1921.  I just found out his middle name was Wesley.
Now where have I heard that name before????

And a big happy birthday to Jonathan Frakes.

Been a while since my last update.  Where to begin?

First off, SOF is really going to knock you out.  Just you wait and see. It
keeps getting better every day.

About StartCraft, things there are good also.  Last week we had four games.  I was on
the losing team for the first game (me and Eric Turman).  But then the gods smiled down 
upon me and my teammate.  The second game I was able to hold Brian Raffel and Brian Shubat
off long enough for Eric Turman to get his mighty Protoss fleet built.  After that I just
watched the big scouring pad of carriers wipe out town after town.  For the third game,
Brian Shubat and I teamed up as Zurgs and beat the Protoss scum before they knew what hit
them.  For the fourth game (yes, we play alot) the Zurgs once again stepped on the Protoss
and crushed them like paper cups.  It was very satisfying.

About the Sci-fi/Horror/Fantasy webzine, that is coming along quite nicely.  Rob Gee has
been kind enough to put the site together.  We have some very good submissions but we're
always looking for more - so if you're a writer or an artist, send us your stuff.  We hope
to have our first edition out the end of this month. 

Send horror works to Eric Biessman at ebiessman@ravensoft.com
Send fantasy works to Kenn Hoekstra at khoekstra@ravensoft.com
Send sci-fi works to Robert Love at rlove@ravensoft.com


And lastly, Christian Slater and Steven Segal are still terrible actors and John
Denver is still dead.

Sounds like we were very well received in Gen Con. 

Goodbye to MST3K - it was a good show and it will be missed.

And if you get a chance go and see "The Iron Giant" it was a great movie.

Submission Guidelines for yet-to-be-named webzine :


Writing :

We want short stories in the horror/fantasy/sci-fi vein.  Size doesn't 
matter (at least in this case) so make the story whatever length it needs to be.  
Other than that we have no real criteria - just make it good.

Send us your story via email in some format that can be read by Word 97.  So Word, Works, 
Word Perfect, or flat ascii would be fine.


Art :

Send us a scanned image (in jpg format) of your horror/fantasy/sci-fi artwork and you 
could be a featured artist or have your work shown with several other artists.


Details :

Send horror works to Eric Biessman at ebiessman@ravensoft.com
Send fantasy works to Kenn Hoekstra at khoekstra@ravensoft.com
Send sci-fi works to Robert Love at rlove@ravensoft.com

Response time may be a little slow but we will get back to you as quick as possible 
on whether your work has been accepted or not. 

Rights to accepted works will be retained by the artist.

Oh, and about money; we don't make any doing this so neither will you - sorry.
