Okay all you writers and artists out there, get your short stories together and come 
take a look at the new webzine Kenn Hoekstra and I are starting called 
"Writers of the Lost Ark".  We need submissions for Fantasy, Sci-fi, and Horror. We're
also looking to promote featured artists. It's currently a work in progress but 
come see it at :

<a href="http://www.writersofthelostark.com">Writers Of The Lost Ark</a>

Send us what you got and be sure to tell Kenn "Good Job!" on the website.

Remember my threat to release "A Tale from the Land of Confusion"? Well, looks like it's
gonna happen real soon. 


And on a work related note - menus, menus, and more menus.

Remember the story called "A Tale from the Land of Confusion"? It was written on my plan 
file quite a while back and it's characters were based on people here at Raven Software; 
Chris Foster was the evil wizard, Jeff Lampo was his lackey, Jeff Butler was the 
musclebound hero,and Eric Biessman was the good king. And it featured special guest
Rob Gee was the necromancer Beroge.  

Well, the story has been completely rewritten and once the site is set up, 
I'll be releasing it a chapter every other day. It'll be a couple weeks but I'll 
keep you informed. 


Here's a link to the original version (care of Martin Edelius)
