Work, work, work - Hello, boys.


A little bit of today's Land of Confusion chapter featuring the mighty Raven players:

   "Then join me," urged the mage. "Join me as I sweep my armies of darkness across the 
human kingdoms, subjecting mankind to a crushing reign of intolerance and evil."
   "I don't mean to rain on your parade but you don't appear to have an army," noted Irons.
   "Well, yes. There is that," agreed Blackwell. "But I've just started. Give me a couple 
weeks. Soon I'll have thousands of men fighting for my cause. Trust me, I've got a 
timetable all worked out."

  Beware Kenn Hoekstra - his HTML powers are growing stronger! He just updated 
Writer's of the Lost Ark with the first installment of "A Tale from the Land of 
Confusion". (It's based on the people of Raven Software)

Here's a a little taste of LOC :

  Foster looked at Jennings from behind hooded eyes. "I ask you again to release me."
  The dean gave a soft chuckle. "I can sense you're trying to cast a spell, misfit. 
Do you see how easily I deflect it?"
   "This is the final time I will warn you."
   "Son," said Jennings, his voice taking an icy tone, "You've made an enemy out of me 
and that's. . . what's that smell? That's me! My hair! My hair's on fire! Ahhh! Help! 
Help me!" 
   After the Jennings incident, Foster became even more of an outcast, inspiring fear 
in teachers and students alike. It was a very lonely time for the poor lad.




And on a work related note - things are getting a little tense around here, now that
the Star Trek team's been in crunch mode for a while. Rob Gee and Andy Trabbold pulled
knives on me in the breakroom for taking the last bag of Doritos from the vending 
machine. Fortunately, Chris Foster was there to wrestle them to the ground and 
sedate them. Unfortunately he didn't have any extra sedative for me.

Okay all you writers and artists out there, get your short stories together and come 
take a look at the new webzine Kenn Hoekstra and I are starting called 
"Writers of the Lost Ark".  We need submissions for Fantasy, Sci-fi, and Horror. We're
also looking to promote featured artists. It's currently a work in progress but 
come see it at :

Send us what you got and be sure to tell Kenn "Good Job!" on the website.

Remember my threat to release "A Tale from the Land of Confusion"? Well, looks like it's
gonna happen real soon. 


And on a work related note - menus, menus, and more menus.

Remember the story called "A Tale from the Land of Confusion"? It was written on my plan 
file quite a while back and it's characters were based on people here at Raven Software; 
Chris Foster was the evil wizard, Jeff Lampo was his lackey, Jeff Butler was the 
musclebound hero,and Eric Biessman was the good king. And it featured special guest
Rob Gee was the necromancer Beroge.  

Well, the story has been completely rewritten and once the site is set up, 
I'll be releasing it a chapter every other day. It'll be a couple weeks but I'll 
keep you informed.
