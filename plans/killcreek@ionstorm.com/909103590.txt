Ok I am a dork.. I forgot to thank Berenger "Zor" Fish of Rogue Entertainment. He's a "special" guy and one hell of a level designer! :) I fear him.. I think he knows a little too much about me, but at least I can beat him down in deathmatch! *wink* And he allowed me the pleasure of attending his wedding! :)

Seriously, Berenger has been a great friend and wonderful to work with. I'm looking forward to seeing his work in Ground Zero!

=)


Aww hell.. two plan updates and already getting corrections :)

My first .plan undate... neat! =)


**Working at Ion**

After my first few weeks of working at Ion Storm as a game tester I can honestly say I love it here!!! The people here are amazingly cool, the games rule, and the surroundings are phenominal. I know its chic to be negative these days, but I cannot deny how exhillerating it is to come to work here each morning. :) The guys here have truly gone out of their way to make the new girl feel welcome, and they have succeeded. I simply cannot imagine a better job for me anywhere.


**Games**

Jazz Jackrabbit 2

It looks like Jazz 2 -- the sequel to the 1994 arcade game of the year -- just hit the shelves a couple days ago! I was extremely fortunate to be the writer of the official strategy guide, so I got a good chance to gain an intimate knowledge of the game. :) I must say, Jazz 2 is one of the best games I have ever played. Don't write it off just because its a side scroller, Jazzy 2 has more gameplay and nifty secrets than most of the games on the market.  If you enjoyed all the old console side scrollers like Mario Bros and Sonic, you will *love* Jazz 2. Its envirnoments are rich and complex with tons of stuff to blow up and kill. :) The characters are fun, and the levels are quite a challenge. Check this game out, you won't regret it!! At the very least go download the shareware at http://www.jazzjackrabbit.com/.    

SiN

Congrats to Ritual on a spectacular demo! I was blown away by every part it. I was fortunate enough to catch a glimpse at everyone working at such a furious pace in the days before release. Those guys are seriously hardcore! We have been playing tons of SiN multiplayer here in the afternoons and smacking eachother down. Congrats to all of Ritual for turning out such impressive work. :) 

Dominion

I will admit, I did not give Dominion a chance before I started here. Since my first day a couple of weeks ago, I have become a total addict. The multiplayer is incredible. I highly encourage you to give it a try sometime, you won't be sorry. Now if I could just find out how Alex wins every single game.. damn engineers! My advice is this: play as the Darken and build lots of rocket towers, dreadnaughts, and engineers. Davo -- want another beating? :)

Daikatana

Wow. I thought the game looked good a couple of mnths ago, but it seems to have gotten exponentially cooler since then. The art is stunning and the architecture is beyond compare. You guys are going to love it! 


**People**

As you all probably know by now, our beloved Joey Liaw is left us last week! I only wish I could have been here for more of his stay. I'll miss that guy, hes the un-funniest!



**Music**

If you didn't know, I "borrowed" my name from a regional band from the Midwest. They are amazing! Check out their homepage at http://www.killcreek.com. It's highly amusing. :) Thay are badasses, and darn nice guys to boot.

I just bought Barenaked Ladies latest album Stunt. A surprisingly good recording! Get it. :)
