Oh .. my .. Things here in the big green tower are getting excessively exciting!! Spirits around the office seem to be higher than ever before as everyone gets their first taste of Daikatana deathmatch and the Anachronox teaser. 

Re: the Anox Teaser

Wowow! This thing shocked me down! I found myself speechless after viewing it. How can this *possibly* be Quake engine?!?! It's just amazing and includes some of the most distinctive locations I've ever seen. Strider and all the Anox crew have done a phenomenal job and put together something to be truly proud of. 

Re: the Daikatana deathmatch demo

All I can say is.. Holy S*#T!!!! There are no words for how fun the deathmatch is right now.. and we are still in the tweaking stages. Do not fear action fans, Daikatana is superfast, hardcore carnage at its best. Cool effects, useful features, awesome art, and some kickass levels are really coming together to make this game ROCK HARD (as our lead Artist Eric Smith would say..:)! This multiplayer demo will show off only a small fraction of the gibby goodness that will abound in the full product.. but you will get the idea :) The pure carnage is amazing!!

Xcalibur has done a great job with Storm Sector Seven (the map formerly known as Storm Sector Two). You can catch a tiny glimpse of it in a screenshot on the Daily Informant at http://www.ionstorm.com. Look close and you might even see the rain.. :) The weapon in that screenshot is the Shotcycler-6 -- one of the five Episode One weapons that will be available in the demo. 

The coolest thing is this.. though we have known it all along, its finally starting to hit home that we are essentially making *FOUR DIFFERNT GAMES* all in one! Hello? I guess that fact wasn't real to me until we started making Episode One so badass and I realized we get to do this with *THREE MORE* sets of weapons and maps! Oh my GOD! Maybe Iâ€™m just slow, but the ultimate coolness of this fact is really hitting home these days more than ever before. The episodes will be very distinct and each has its own personality. I can assure you, Daikatana is going to be worth the wait. The DK team is indeed ROCK HARD and dedicated to making this game what it should be.

Can you tell I'm excited? :)
