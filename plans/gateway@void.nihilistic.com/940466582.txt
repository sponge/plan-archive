Wow these months are just flying by.  On the level design
part of the game things are really looking good.  I know we are
pushing the limits of quality of level design with this project
and will continue to in our next projects.  

With the trend of how technology on cpu's and graphic cards are 
being pushed every day we get closer and closer to photo realistic 
types of environments.

On another note I have been so busy that I forgot to congratulate
some of my best friends on their completion of Age of Empires II.

Once again Ensemble Studios pulls together another great game.  
The game play and graphics are really pushed to the max on this RTS.

Congratulations on such hard work guys.

.. 

If you’re going to see two movies this summer check out American
Beauty and Fight Club.

American Beauty is so well written and I think everyone that see's
that movie walks away with something.

"Its just a damn couch" :)


F.Y.I

I’m looking for a web graphics guy to help me out on my personal
web page seeing how I really don’t have much time to do anything
else that work on this game.
