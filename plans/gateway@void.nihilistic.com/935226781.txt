It's been a long time since I have updated my plan.
Things have been really busy here at Nihilistic Software
since E3 and the game is coming along really well.

I’m sure that allot of you in the level editing community will
enjoy making V:TM levels as well.

I checked out the Game Spy Beat down here in SFO on Sat. and I have
to say that’s the way a LAN party should be.  "One Bag of Chips" :)

Next topic.

There is something going on here in the SFO that I wanted to make
everyone aware of that cares about the ClubMusic  Scene.  One of my
favorite after hours clubs is in the process of being shut down.

Here is a quote from Amanda Nowinski of www.sfbg.com

The city has an agenda to get rid of all after-hours licenses in the 
South of Market, Ten 15 Folsom general manager Brooks Pettus says. 
"This is currently the Southern police station's biggest target for 
one reason: the success of the South of Market clubs is in direct 
conflict with gentrification going on around us." 

This is not the first police assault against Ten 15 Folsom. In 1998 
the club won a four-year battle in federal court against police attempts 
to revoke its after-hours permit. "We believe that this is in part a 
retaliation for the fact that we asserted our rights under the First 
Amendment and won," the club's attorney, Joe Wood, says. "Ten 15 is 
the biggest and most powerful club in the city – one that can stand 
up to the police and win. They hope that if they succeed in shutting 
down Ten 15, everyone else in the club community will give up the fight." 


Anyhow there is a online petition that you can sign up for please
take the time to fill out this info and spread the word.

btw these are my own personal thoughts/opinions on all of this and
doesn’t reflect Nihilistic Software Stance.
