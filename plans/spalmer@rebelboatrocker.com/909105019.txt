Ok, that's it, the cat has a name.  I forgot to mention that it was a male cat,
sorry bout that.  Here's what my sis had to say:

>Being the chemical engineer that I am I need to use
>reference materials a lot to look up properties of chemicals .  One book
>that I use all the time is the Merck Index, and it's sitting right here
>next to my computer.  So, after staring at that all day while I read
>emails (not that i just read emails all day) I decided to name him Merck,
>kind of like Mark but a little nerdier:)

so there you have it!  That was fun! wasn't it? right? c'mon guys ..

Today I will use this forum in a manipulative and completely off-topic manner.

My sister (18, single, and very attractive) just bought a kitten, because it
used the jedi-cat "cute" trick on her and melted her weak little heart.  So
anyhow, <A HREF="http://rebelboatrocker.com/~spalmer/it.jpg">this little devil</A> needs a name.  Help her out guys! send your
ideas to <A HREF="mailto:apalmer@mail.earth1.net">apalmer@mail.earth1.net.</A>

I shouldn't have to say it, but, be nice! big brother is watching ...
