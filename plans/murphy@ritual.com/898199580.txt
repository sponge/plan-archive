introduction: 3d modeler/animator on FAKK2.
figured now would be a good time to start the old plan file.  it's great to be here at Ritual.  i can walk  down the hall without 
running in to somebody's ego -- it's amazing.  i feel pretty lucky to be one of the soul survivors of the neon-green titanic.

anyway, getting started on FAKK2. this is going to be an incredible project to work on and judging from the way things are going on design
an incredible game as well.  as for me, i'm modeling characters.  doing the high poly first.  these are some of the coolest characters
i've seen.  joel (concept guy) did a great job creating a unique and consistent look.  after i get a few models out of the way then i may
do a little animating. it for now.

well, two characters down as far as modeling goes.  a fat one and a skinny one.  sort of a laurel and hardy in a sick, twisted world.
it's thursday and tonights the night to get the videos before they're all rented out for the weekend.  just thought i'd mention that.
and while you're there, rent "bottle rocket" if you haven't seen it.  watch it man...you'll thank me.
