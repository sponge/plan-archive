after nearly two months, it's time for a plan update.  things are really moving along on FAKK2.  got a whole plethora  of 
characters modeled, and a few animations.  we've also got a few of them skinned and they look awsome.  i recently played the Abes Exodus
demo and was once again blown away.  the world Inhabitants created is every bit as immersive and real as Riven.  again, that's what we 
want to do with FAKK2.  create a unique rich world with the most interesting of characters.  i want people to be so taken in by the world 
that they have a hard time concentrating because they're constantly looking around. or the characters so interesting that you just can't 
shoot them immediately because you want to look at them for a while.  and of course the game play will have to be addicting as well.
anyway, it's an exciting project to be working on.
