Well, here I am - itching to write and there's nothing to go off on a tirade about.
How pitiful.

I have gotten e-sheaves of mail from people asking me why I don't update my finger
everyday like Kenn and a lot of the other people here at Raven.
The answer is simple.  I keep my thoughts to myself a lot of the time, 
and I weigh what I say with deliberate forethought.  (Is this a rip on them?)

I could tell you all how I had an insane desire to leave work yesterday and
head out to my Grandpa's apple orchard in Marshall,  that I am still
churning away at night on my pencil and paper Role-Playing Game or even that
I wrote a bunch of new poetry this week.  But I usually don't.

Besides it not being very interesting to most of you out there, it seems like
such a waste of words.

Ah well, maybe I'm getting bitter in my old age.

I guess there's also the fact that I have nothing work-related to report as of yet.
And couldnt, even if I wanted to.  I'm doing research...


Question:  Who to you (the adoring public) is the most visible/valuable/inspired
           member of our team here at Raven?  Why? 
           I know this is a hard question to answer since you all have your favorites,
           but try anyway.
           I'm just curious.

Yes, it's Monday the thirteenth...
Oh Joy.

It's been a long time since I've updated this thing, mainly because I've
been so busy.  Editing Bob's story is a cool job, since I get to read it
before anybody else.

I have been asked, "Are you really evil?"  and, "Why the burning heads?"

All I can say is, "Ask BOB."

He's the author of our fate, the penman of our doom...
We all must bow and scrape to him just to stay alive in the story.

I know for a fact that Lampo offered to wash and wax Bob's sporty little
babe-magnet Fiero every day if he could get lucky in the story...
Well, Bob's car is glaringly bright from my window...and Lampo has
three, count 'em - three evil women - at his beck and call.

Kenn...well, never mind about Kenn.
I wouldn't want to embarass him in front of his adoring public...

I guess I got off lucky offering to do his work for the next three months.
Anyone out there know anything about C++ that they could teach me in
less than a couple hours?
I'd hate for Bob to get into trouble over me...
floating point error?  what the hell's a floating point error?
Maybe I can talk Lampo into doing this stuff...It's just AI code...I think.

Question: Are the people behind the games the actual 'industry'?
Keeping up with the name game in this business seems to be the
burning passion of so many of us.
I play the games, I research them as they are being produced.  I rarely pay
attention to the names of those who put out their .plan files.  I just click and go.

This is not to say that I don't recognize the names, indeed many times I do.
But just because a name is attached to a paragraph doesn't make it gospel.

In the spirit of  true friendly banter here at RAVEN, I was asked who a certain
someone is.  I'd heard the name, and knew he was in charge of a Software Company.
(The president in fact!), but I just couldn't finger him (ha-ha).

I was chuckled at and eyes were rolled.  I had indeed read his plan before, but never
payed much attention to his 'title'.  I appreciate his puzzle questions (indeed they...um
puzzle me) and his info.  But I must apologize to.......

Scott Miller of 3D Realms.
I enjoyed your plan, not caring who in the wide world you were.
See, you impressed me despite your title!  (Not that being president is a bad thing...)

Sorry, 
I'm not much on protocol.  We're all in this business together, trying to reach (mostly)
the same customers.  I love games and will continue forever pay attention to the names
of those who make them!  I promise!
Really!

And thank you Bob Love for making me out to be the villain I always wanted to be!
(I'm wearing all black again!)

So Bob Love discovered my true past.   I'm thinking of Bob, a flame, and a hospital
bill the size of Santa's Good Child List.  Have a nice life, Bob-O!

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, read Bob Love's finger for today.

And with all the confidence inspired by Kenn's lead in to my segment...(?)

Fade Away: Part III

She drove around for the better part of an hour, saying nothing.  I assumed
she'd talk more when she was ready, so I sat back and just watched her out
of the corner of my eye.

My mother always warned me about life in the city, but like all young men
looking for a way out of their dull lives - I left home at the first
opportunity.  My first job was washing cars, the kind of work that leaves
your mind free to think and wander.  I had a lot of dreams back then.
A lot of nonsense thought up by a gullible mind.
Dreams are for poets and politicians.  I know that now for a certainty.
I've known it since the day I met Destiny face to face in a red mustang.

We reached an empty parking lot on the corner of Third and Chandler.
Not a good neighborhood.  The streets in that part of town wind around
the buildings like those ribbons on balloons and upscale christmas presents.
Going nowhere you'd like to end up and somewhere you're better off not being.

After she killed the engine, she reached for the glove compartment and began
searching. Failing there, and ignoring my curious glance, she continued
her search in the back.

"Oh no", she said, "I must've dropped my purse in that alleyway..."

She then looked at me.
The way a lost child looks at the clerk in a store.
The way a puppy looks at you when its been bad.
The way a woman looks at a man when she's about to take control of his life...

Happy Birthday, Nicolaus Copernicus! 
If it's your birthday today, too - then Happy Birthday to you...!
(Supposedly, people born today tend to be Scientists and Astronomers.)

I, however, was born last week in 1970 - excluding me from the big-money jobs
aforementioned; instead being given over to ones like: car-wash attendant,
janitor,  level designer and the ever sought after position of Dead Man #3.

The fates are indeed fickle...

If you were born this month, mail me and let me know what profession you
currently pursue or hope to pursue (you poor, disillusioned person, you...).
I'd like to know if these Astrologers are on the money or if they're just
"making it up as they go along..."

Half a bee, philosophically - 
must, ipso facto -
half not be...

And by the way, Computer Repair Specialists is not in this office anymore!
They're down on Odana Road!  ARGGGGGHHHHH!
