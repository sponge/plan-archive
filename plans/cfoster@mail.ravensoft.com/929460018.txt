Now, that I'm out from under the shadow of scheduling and planning for a day or so I
thought I'd update this thing.

We're currently halfway through production on the Scavenger Base areas.  I've nearly
completed the exterior portion of my airlock level, where Munro and others will hopefully
get the chance to utilize their Starfleet vac suits for a short spacewalk.

Most of the areas of Voyager have been completed in their raw form, just waiting to be 
realistically roughed up and damaged.  

Our design team is doing a terrific job of fitting the extremely complex areas from Voyager
into the sometimes restrictive limitations of a game engine.  Quake3 is the only
engine that I would even want to try this in!

Any questions?  Mail me!

Things progress smoothly on our Star Trek: Voyager game...
Levels are looking great, and we're in the final planning stages for June's production.

Also, the scripting interface is nearing completion, so those of us who are not heavily
into programming can make the game do what we want.

Well, long time no write.

I'm sure most of you have heard the announcement...we're doing a Star Trek: Voyager game for Activision!

We'll let you know more as soon as we are ready.

I'm still recovering from the deluge of info I gained from the GDC in San Jose.
Saw a number of really good lectures on game design as well as some very poor ones.

On the bright side I met a lot of really cool people in the industry!

I'd like to thank the people from NAD in Montreal (Ian, Eric, Luc, Danielle and JF) for wandering around with us, the guys from the Babylon 5 team for ditching the Microsoft party with us, and the gentlemen from Firaxis for hanging out with us.

The most interesting lectures I attended were actually not all that directly related to what my
actual job is.  I did attend a lecture on Puzle Game Design by Scott Kim and Alexey Pajitnov (hope I spelled that right) which was great, as well as a panel on The future of 3D Level Design which was anything but great; but my favorite lecture/tutorial was Storyplaying (using stories and characters effectively in a game) by Lee Sheldon.  It was an 8-hour tutorial (whew) in which I mostly verified my own ideas on story and character use.  Nice knowing that a one-time TV script writer and I think alike...

More on all of this later...I have work to do!
