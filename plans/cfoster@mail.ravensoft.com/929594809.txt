Ah, the joys of less than perfect communication!

In order to clear up a few items regarding our game, I felt it was necessary to update my
.plan file today.

First off...you play the Game as Alexander Munro, a security specialist aboard the Voyager.
A member of an elite force of away team operatives, Munro will be called upon to defend 
the ship and its crew from the dangers in a hostile environment.  Trapped in an artificial
pocket of space by alien beings, Voyager is disabled and beset on all sides by ruthless
scavengers as well as the race which has them trapped.

He will explore many areas on Voyager, (yes even the mess hall...), as well as numerous
alien craft also trapped within the pocket.

The game will be a single-player affair, with Holomatch options; including Deathmatch, other
team games and possibly Multiplayer Co-operative missions outside of the regular single-player
game.

Munro will have a number of weapons at his disposal throughout the game, some Federation tech...
some not.

Holomatch will basically be a Holodeck generated combat stage with the ability to fight
other players and score as if running a training exercise.  When a player is 'killed' he
is transported back to the command staging area to reset himself, re-arm and then
're-spawn' (i.e. randomly be transported back within the playing area).

As an aside, what do you all think about the idea of 'Siege' type missions for Holomatch?

Hope this answers most of the questions I got.


And No, you are not going to be able to play as Tuvok in the game, sorry!  Possibly
in Multiplayer, but not in the single-player game.

Also...for a more concise definition of the Hazard Team (the 'elite force' mentioned earlier)
as well as a synopsis of the characters, see Mike Gummelt's .plan file!

Now, that I'm out from under the shadow of scheduling and planning for a day or so I
thought I'd update this thing.

We're currently halfway through production on the Scavenger Base areas.  I've nearly
completed the exterior portion of my airlock level, where Munro and others will hopefully
get the chance to utilize their Starfleet vac suits for a short spacewalk.

Most of the areas of Voyager have been completed in their raw form, just waiting to be 
realistically roughed up and damaged.  

Our design team is doing a terrific job of fitting the extremely complex areas from Voyager
into the sometimes restrictive limitations of a game engine.  Quake3 is the only
engine that I would even want to try this in!

Any questions?  Mail me!

Things progress smoothly on our Star Trek: Voyager game...
Levels are looking great, and we're in the final planning stages for June's production.

Also, the scripting interface is nearing completion, so those of us who are not heavily
into programming can make the game do what we want.

Well, long time no write.

I'm sure most of you have heard the announcement...we're doing a Star Trek: Voyager game for Activision!

We'll let you know more as soon as we are ready.

I'm still recovering from the deluge of info I gained from the GDC in San Jose.
Saw a number of really good lectures on game design as well as some very poor ones.

On the bright side I met a lot of really cool people in the industry!

I'd like to thank the people from NAD in Montreal (Ian, Eric, Luc, Danielle and JF) for wandering around with us, the guys from the Babylon 5 team for ditching the Microsoft party with us, and the gentlemen from Firaxis for hanging out with us.

The most interesting lectures I attended were actually not all that directly related to what my
actual job is.  I did attend a lecture on Puzle Game Design by Scott Kim and Alexey Pajitnov (hope I spelled that right) which was great, as well as a panel on The future of 3D Level Design which was anything but great; but my favorite lecture/tutorial was Storyplaying (using stories and characters effectively in a game) by Lee Sheldon.  It was an 8-hour tutorial (whew) in which I mostly verified my own ideas on story and character use.  Nice knowing that a one-time TV script writer and I think alike...

More on all of this later...I have work to do!
