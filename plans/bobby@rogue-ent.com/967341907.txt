Hey all, just checkin' in to see what all you cats are up to.  As for myself, 
well us Rogue-types cruised out to the new id offices last night for a little
beta testing for Team Arena, and all I can say is "WOW!"  That is by far some
of the most fun I've had in a long, long time.  The new maps are sweet, of course.
But what really rocks the gameplay are the new powerups, weapons, items, and 
gameplay types.  Man, oh man!  The chaingun is, how can I put it...  BADASS!
When you're firing that thing it feels like you're carrying around a big 30MM gun
from an A-10 and chopping people into pieces.  The kamikaze item is insane.
If you like blowing people up, you'll love that one.  But my favorite, by far, was the 
new powerups.  One in particluar was my power-up of choice.  I loved it so much
that when one of my teammates would take it, I would be yelling and screaming at 
them for taking it :)  Long story short - Team Arena rocked my socks off!

Oh, and BTW...  RED TEAM RULES!!!  I won't go into the gory details of how badly the
blue team got smacked down last night, but I'll just say that blue team only won
one game all last night, and it was after I had left :)

On the work front...  Still messing with Queen's garden maps.  Now it's just going
back through and trying to make them look purty.  Adding lots of detail textures,
some minor detail architecture here and there, and doing some final lighting.  
Not the funnest part of building levels (I enjoy actually building the architecture
the most), but it's a vital part of the level design process.  Let's face it, even
if you have the most beautiful architecture in the world, without the good textures
and nice lighting, it'll still look like a$$.  Lucky for me, I have two of the best 
texture guys around, IMHO, Chris Greenhaw and Steve Hornback.

Anyways, that's all for now kiddies.  Until next time...

Damn.  Looks like Jim scooped me on the congrats for Ritual on FAKK2 going gold.
Oh well.  Congrats anyways guys.  Can't wait to see the final version.  Everything
I have seen of it so far looks pretty cool.  The important question is...

"When's the party?"  

/me loves occasions that call for mass consumption of alcoholic beverages :) 


Work on Alice is chugging right along.  I'm still knee-deep in the Queen's Garden
levels.  Their turning out pretty nicely so far, or atleast that what my co-workers
tell me.  But then, they have to say my work's cool or I'll bust out my now-bionic 
arm on some a$$.  :)

That's all for now kiddies.  Until next time...

Just wanted to let you guys know about a couple Alice happenings around the net.
First, there are 3 Alice movies available for download from Daily Radar as part of
their "American McGee's Alice Week".  Some of the footage is the same that was
seen in the larger movie that was released a while back, but all 3 of these new
movies include new footage showing off some more of the gameplay.  You can check
it out here:

http://www.dailyradar.com/features/game_feature_page_1146_1.html


Also, there is an Alice preview over at Well-Rounded Entertainment which includes
some new screenshots:

http://www.well-rounded.com/games/reviews/alice_pre1.html


As far as work goes, I'm proud to be able to say that I'm back in action.  My arm, while
still far from being fully recovered, is functional enough for me to resume
designing levels, albeit with several small breaks when it starts hurting too much.
Currently working on some Queen's grounds.  Getting to make some really freaky, scary
looking stuff, or atleast trying to :)

On a non-work related note, I am playing and really enjoying Third Law's
KISS - Psycho Circus.  The hordes of monsters on the screen at once brings back
memories of blasting my way through Doom2, which is a *good* thing.  But even
beyond that, there is alot of cool stuff in this game.  The enemy design is superb - 
some really nightmarish creations.  And, of course, the level design is top notch.
I've finished the water realm, and am almost to the end of the earth realm.  The only
glitches I have seen so far are the jump/fire buttons getting stuck sometimes, but
that's hardly something to really worry about, IMO.  All in all, Third Law has done
a very fine job in producing a solid, entertaining first product.  Looking forward
to seeing what these guys are going to work on next.

That's all for now kiddies.  Until next time...

Just wanted to jump on the bandwagon and say "Congrats" to the Third Law guys
for finishing KPC.  I haven't actually gotten to play through the demo yet, since
I'm still a bit of a one-armed gimp, but from what I have seen of it, it is looking
pretty cool.  Can't wait to see the whole thing.

That's all for now kiddies.  Until next time...

It's been a while... part of that would be due to the fact that I broke my arm
a couple weeks ago.  I've played baseball my whole life, all the way through college.
This summer, I thought I would join one of the amateur baseball leagues here in Dallas,
and relive the glory days.  All was going well, quite well in fact.  I was even slated
to be the starting pitcher for the all-star game coming up in a couple weeks.  
Then disaster struck.  My arm had been sore for a while, but I figured it was simply
the usual arm soreness pitchers go through.  So, I'm pitching yet another game, arm getting 
more sore each inning.  Finally, in the 4th inning, I have 2 strikes on the batter, and I 
decide to really muscle up and blow a fastball by this guy for strike 3.  I wind up, go to 
throw, and *SNAP*.  The snap is so loud, everyone in the stands can hear it.  My
arm falls, and I notice that it's bending not at the elbow, but about halfway between my elbow
and shoulder.  

After a trip to the hospital, and several morphine shots, the doctor informs me that I broke
in 3 pieces.  It's going to require extensive surgery.  After a 4 hour operation, I'm left
with a steel plate running the length of my upper arm, and 13 screws holding it in place.
Yes, it is permanent.  Should be fun going through airports.  :)

So now I'm laid up, bottle of painkillers at my side.  If you've never broke 
a bone or had surgery, I highly DO NOT recommend it.  It is not very fun at all.
And it's pretty damn difficult to do level design one-handed.  Good news is the Doc
says I should fully recover...  in six months.  :(

Anyways, that's the latest with me.  Aside from that, Alice is looking nice.
If you haven't checked out the movie clip from the game at PCIGN.com, you might
wanna take a look to see what we got going on.

Finally, I wanna wish everyone a happy and SAFE 4th of July.  I recently lost a couple
good girl friends to drunk driving.  It's just not worth it.  If you know you're
going to be drinking, make arrangements for alternate transportation.  Your friends
and family will thank you for it, believe me.

BTW, if you haven't seen PATRIOT, I highly recommend it.  Sure, it's inevitably gonna
draw comparisons to BRAVEHEART, but it is a very good film, regardless.
Well worth the $7.

That's it for now kiddies.  Until next time...

Just want to extend my congratulations to the entire Daikatana team for getting
that badboy out the door.  I know all too well it was a long, hard, oftentimes 
frustrating journey, but now you get to sit back and relax.  Enjoy it, because Lord
knows you all definitely deserve it.

On that note, I just finished playing through the Daikatana demo (single player
only).  I'd be lying if I said I haven't seen all the negative things so many
people have had to say about the demo, but I made the decision to go into the
demo with an "OPEN MIND" (two words which seem to have escaped many people's 
vocabularies nowadays).  After playing it through, I have to say that I found the
demo pretty entertaining.  No, it's not the prettiest game in the world, although
I think it looks pretty damn good for the Q2 engine - volumetric fog, those completely
BADASS skies, etc.  There are obvious lowpoints about the game, but that can be said about
every game ever made.  No game is perfect, or ever will be.  WHen it comes down
to it, though, the bottom line for me is did I have a fun time playing.  And I have
to say the answer is definitely yes.  I'm not saying it was the most fun I've ever 
had playing a game, but it was still fun. 

It seems nowadays, so many people get caught up in wanting to compare games to each
other, pitting game companies against each other, instead of taking each game and 
playing them with an open mind, and evaluating whether or not they think the game
is fun to play, regardless of how it stacks up to other games, past or present.
Different games are going to be just that - different.  Just because a game isn't 
exactly like Half Life, or UT, or Q3, doesn't automatically mean it's a piece of
crap.  It just means it's different, and should be evaluated on its own merits. 
The sad thing is, these are the people losing out the most, because they refuse
to give a game a chance which might actually turn out to be one helluva fun time.

So, if you haven't tried the demo yet, my advice would be to try to ignore anything
you have read about it, positive or negative, download it and give it a try.  You might
just find that you actually enjoy playing it.  I mean, I worked on the damn game, so
I knew more of what to expect than anyone, but I admit, that reading all the negative
hype about the demo even had me a little skeptical.  But in the end, I had a good
time playing it, and that's all that really matters in the end, IMHO.

Anyways, that's all for now kiddies.  Until next time...

Just a quick note for all you aspiring mappers out there.  If, for some strange
reason, you either haven't heard of or just haven't bothered checking out RUST,
perhaps the most comprehensive and informative level design site available, you
REALLY need to.  So point your little browser to http://www.gamedesign.net and 
be awe-inspired by the amount of information they have available for mapping for
just about any game you could want to make levels for.

Now, once you've been to RUST, you'll notice that according to the poll on the 
left there are ALOT of aspiring mappers who would like to see more tutorials.  
The reason I mention this is because I have been wanting to do some mapping 
tutorials for the community for a while now, but to be honest, I don't really know
what it is you guys are looking for help on.  So I figured I'd let y'all tell me
what you want more info/tips about.  So if you're a mapper looking for tips about
something, and you have a spare minute or two, feel free to drop me an email at 
bobby@rogue-ent.com and let me know what you would like to see some tutorials about.

Now, I can't promise that I'll do a tutorial for everything that everybody wants.
What I will do is see what the most popular topic(s) seem to be that people want
help on, and try to whip up some tutorials for those subjects.  Dunno how long it'll
take to get the tutorials finished and online, as I am pretty busy with work on
"Alice", but I'll try to get them out as soon as I can.

Looking forward to hearing from all of you.  That's all for now kiddies.  Until 
next time...

WOW!  I must say you guys overwhelmed me with the number of responses with your
thoughts on Alice.  I think I replied to most of you, but if I missed anyone, I just
wanted to say "Thanks" for taking the time out to write in with your thoughts.
I also just want to reiterate that this was a *personal* curiosity on my part, and in no way
means that anything anyone wrote in with will or won't be in the game.  I can
assure you, however, that we will do everything we can to make sure playing ALICE
is as immersive and exciting as possible. 

Thanks again everyone.  It's exciting to see there's such a big interest in the game
already.

That's all for now kiddies.  Until next time...

Work goes well.  Levels are really coming along nicely.  It's really cool to see
how things are shaping up with Alice.  

I'm really curious to hear what everyone would like to see in Alice.  Let me be
completely clear in that this is strictly a personal curiosity, and doesn't necessarily
mean any of it will end up being seen in the game.  But I am interested in hearing the
community's thoughts and ideas, etc.  So if you have a minute and want to share
some of your thoughts about what you would like to see in Alice, drop me an email at
bobby@rogue-ent.com and lemme know what ya got on your mind.  Feel free to discuss
any and all aspects of the game.  I'm not going to make any promises about having time
to reply to everyone, as this is going to be a very busy work week for me.  Got a 
deadline coming up this Friday and all.

Thanks in advance for taking your time to share your thoughts.  That's all for now
kiddies.  Until next time...

Well, now that Jim let the cat out of the bag about all the new talent here at
Rogue, I thought I'd share a little bit about what I'm working on for Alice.  Right
now I am working on a group of levels that make up the Caterpillar Garden.  For
those of you who recall the story, Alice meets the Caterpillar after she is shrunk.
So basically, I'm constructing these levels of enormously grand scale since Alice 
is about the size of an ant.  I'm sure most of you remember Levelord's Sin DM level
(I believe it was 'Spry') where you were running around fraggin each other in an
enormously oversized living room.  Well, that's pretty much the feeling you're gonna
have when you run around these levels.  I'm really pleased with the way it's turning
out so far, and it's alot of fun to be able to design something so different from
the norm.  It presents alot of interesting challenges and opportunities to do some
really weird and original stuff.  I personally have always felt that novelty is
a key element to making really cool, memorable levels.

Also, I wanna say "congratulations and good luck" to the Daikatana DM Tourney finalists
who are duking it out at the Green Tower as we speak.  The DK party tonight should
definitely be a blast.  I'm just sorry I don't get to attend :(  I'm sure everyone
will have enough fun for me and them both, though :)

Anyways, back to the grindstone.  That's all for now kiddies.  Until next time...

Well now...it's been quite a while since I've done a .plan update.  Part of that, 
of course, would be the fact that I changed jobs.  That's right.  As some of you 
may already know, I left Ion Storm back in September, and am now working at Rogue 
Entertainment, designing for Alice.  My departure from Ion was pretty quiet, which 
is the way I wanted it.  No sense in handing the gossip sites more ammo to go after 
Ion and DK.  Speaking of DK, I got a chance to return to the green tower a few days 
ago, and checked out how DK was looking.  I have to say it has definietly come a 
long way in a short amount of time.  The mappers in particular, seem to have really 
buckled down and kicked some ass finishing off all the remaining level work.  Just 
wanna commend Larry Herring, Chris Cummings, Luke Whiteside, and Stevie Case on what 
looks to be a job very well done.  Wish I coulda been there to help in the final 
stretch.

As far as Rogue and Alice go, I have to say I couldn't be happier with the new job
and the new project.  All the guys here at Rogue are class acts, and the talent level
here is amazing.  There should be press releases coming out in the near future
about all the new guys we have, including yours truly, and you'll be able to see
for yourself just how much talent we have here.  We're all really excited about Alice 
and how things are progressing even at such an early stage in development.  If 
all goes as planned, you can expect Alice to be something totally different than 
you have seen before.  Stay tuned to the official Alice website (alice.ea.com)
for more details.  :)

That's all for now kiddies.  Until next time...
