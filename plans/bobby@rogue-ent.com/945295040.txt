Well now...it's been quite a while since I've done a .plan update.  Part of that, 
of course, would be the fact that I changed jobs.  That's right.  As some of you 
may already know, I left Ion Storm back in September, and am now working at Rogue 
Entertainment, designing for Alice.  My departure from Ion was pretty quiet, which 
is the way I wanted it.  No sense in handing the gossip sites more ammo to go after 
Ion and DK.  Speaking of DK, I got a chance to return to the green tower a few days 
ago, and checked out how DK was looking.  I have to say it has definietly come a 
long way in a short amount of time.  The mappers in particular, seem to have really 
buckled down and kicked some ass finishing off all the remaining level work.  Just 
wanna commend Larry Herring, Chris Cummings, Luke Whiteside, and Stevie Case on what 
looks to be a job very well done.  Wish I coulda been there to help in the final 
stretch.

As far as Rogue and Alice go, I have to say I couldn't be happier with the new job
and the new project.  All the guys here at Rogue are class acts, and the talent level
here is amazing.  There should be press releases coming out in the near future
about all the new guys we have, including yours truly, and you'll be able to see
for yourself just how much talent we have here.  We're all really excited about Alice 
and how things are progressing even at such an early stage in development.  If 
all goes as planned, you can expect Alice to be something totally different than 
you have seen before.  Stay tuned to the official Alice website (alice.ea.com)
for more details.  :)

That's all for now kiddies.  Until next time...

The KING has left the building...
