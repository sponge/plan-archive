There was a bug in the Shogo alpha patch involving the
SoftSnd.dll sound module.  If you have been unable to
initialize sound, snag the replacement from:

ftp://ftp.maison-otaku.net/pub/shogo/patch/SoftSnd.dll

Be warned; that's my personal machine and a) I've put
limits on the FTP load, and b) if it gets pounded into
the ground under downloads, I'll be highly annoyed. :)

Hopefully it'll be mirrored to Blues and Planetshogo and
whatnot soon. :)
