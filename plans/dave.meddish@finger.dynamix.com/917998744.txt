1.27.99
Back to the grind...always good to hear and see the reviews rolling in.  Good Lord, it
looks like we might have a hit on our hands.  This is much better than my former place
of work, which shall go nameless, where I think our games sold a combined total of 32
copies...
<br>
So what is ol' dBack up to?  Making all you mod-makers happy soon.  Being writer-guy, 
I've been put in charge of making documentation for all of our tools that will be 
soon be released.  That includes the Mission Editor, 3D Art tools, the skin maker...all 
that jazz.  Not the most exciting stuff in the world, but hey, it pays the bills (and I
got plenty of those, believe you me).


1.4.99
Tanned, rested and ready (well, at least rested), ol' dBack is back on the case.  
Tried to keep track of things on the message boards, but this was with my parents on 
their *shudder* Macintosh.  I love Macs, but a Performa with a 28.8 just don't cut it.  
Maybe I'll get 'em an iMac for next Christmas.
<br>
Trust all had a safe and happy holidays.  Partied like it was 1999 on New Year's with 
friends at a certain establishment that shall go nameless but involved nubile young women 
in various states of undress.  Will not elaborate further (since I don't remember that 
much about it anyway).
<br>
First things first: As soon as SymLink gets his sorry butt back from Hawaii or wherever 
he is, we'll have an OpenGL patch out, as well as fixing our latest little problems.  As 
for me, I've got design issues to work on, new missions, new races, more writing, etc., 
etc...
<br>
Maybe a Diamond Sword piece.  That's the one tribe I haven't really touched on, so now 
that I've got a little free time, I'll try and get something out on the enigmatic ones 
for your reading enjoyment.
<br>
Oh, and by the way...WHERE'S THE BEER?  Nobody's mailed us any beer yet!  I am greatly 
disappointed.
