So as you all know by now (unless you've been hiding under a rock or playing Q3A--shame on you!), Tribes Extreme is no more.  It has ceased to be.  It is an ex-game.  
<br>
Personally, I think it was the Extreme curse...have you noticed that games with the word "Extreme" in them tend to have bad things happen to them...insert your own "Marketing buzzword" joke here.
<br>
However, it's not a total wash, since the Tribes community will be getting all sorts of free goodies courtesy of we, the repentant devteam.  I (or, as Scott Rudi would say, "we") have been working on getting several Balanced Online missions completed for release sometime next week (hopefully next week, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say we'll have them finished before the millenium ends).
<br>
Mission Building Guru Dave can attest that these will be extremely fun, balanced, and have that "smacks of Meddish" flavor we all know and love.  Dare I say, they shall be "soup-tastic."
<br>
We will also release many of the user-submitted missions, which number around 25+ at last count.  By and large, these are pretty good, too (although our fans seem to go a little turret-happy when laying these things out).
<br>
Disappointments aside, it's a great time to be a Tribes fan.  Tribes 2 just has spiffyness written all over it, and we'll begin making missions very soon.  It's a thing of beauty, T2.  If it doesn't knock your socks off, then you'd better check your pulse there, son.  Those screenshots that have been released for public consumption only scratch the surface of what we're capable of doing with it.
<br>
Back to the grind...I have a feeling that I'd better get those missions done ASAP.  You see, not only are my Oregon State Beavers going to a bowl game for the first time in 30 years, but I've also got a date lined up for the company Christmas party...and if that isn't a sign of the impending apocalypse foretold in the Book of Revalations, then I don't know what is :-)
