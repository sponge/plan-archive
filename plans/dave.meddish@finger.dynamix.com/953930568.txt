With Scott Rudi gone on vacation, that leaves ol' dBack as the head honcho on the design side of TRIBES.  In the words of Alexander Haig, "I'm in control now!"  Okay, maybe not those *exact* words, mind you...
<br>
The good news is that the new Balanced Mission Pack is now available for download from www.tribesplayers.com and no doubt several mirror sites as well.  Being the Christmas season, we've cooked up another present for you, a brief but fairly comprehensive guide to the Balanced Missions, written by yours truly of course.  It's also available at our website.
<br>
I think you'll find all of these new missions to have the appropriate "smacks of Meddish" flavor we all know and love.  My favorites are probably Obfuscation (for the gameplay) and Reliquary ('cause it just looks soooo nice).
<br>
Happy holidays, all!  I shall soon join the Rudimeister in vacation-land and shall return sometime in the next millenium.  Next time, true believers!
