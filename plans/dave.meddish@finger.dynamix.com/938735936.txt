In lieu of the recent events here in sunny (for now) Eugene, OR, I thought I'd take a moment to clear up some potential misconceptions and quash those nasty rumors floating around.
<br>
"TRIBES 2 will be cancelled."
No, we're still on track for a Q1 2000 release.  There is discussion of a possible TRIBES 3.  And TRIBES Extreme is chugging along nicely, so be sure to put that in your letters to Santa.
<br>
In fact, ol' dBack has almost finished something like a gajillion missions for TX (well, it sure seems like a gajillion...I'm starting to see the Terrain Editor in my sleep).  For those itching for new missions to play, TX oughta be your bag.
<br>
"Sierra is closing Dynamix down and moving it lock, stock and barrel to Seattle."
As far as I know, we're not going anywhere.  Say what you will about Eugene, but it is cheaper than the other Emerald City (although far-more hippie-infested).
<br>
"Dave is shacking up with Jeri Ryan from Star Trek: Voyager."
Sadly, this rumor is untrue as well. 
<br>
"Dynamix was eaten by a 60-foot radioactive squirrel."
This, believe it or not, is true!  We got pictures to prove it! (http://tribesforum.sierra.com/tubb/Forum1/HTML/004993.html)!  Oh, the humanity!  
<br>
And if Blake comes near me with a vacuum, I'm gonna break out the whuppin' stick...the things I gotta put up with, I swear...
