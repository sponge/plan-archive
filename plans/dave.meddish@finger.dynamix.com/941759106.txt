Time to make the missions...I'm seeing the Mission Editor in my sleep now.  This is not necessarily a good thing.
<br>
Scott Rudi (yes, that Scott Rudi, he of the famous parentage) and I just did a recent count of our new missions for Tribes Extreme.  We're about up to 100.  No, that is not a typo, over 100 brand-spanking-new missions for your fun and enjoyment.  This includes at least 15 (and probably more by the time you read this) Team vs. Our Very Nasty AI missions.  You think Desert of Death is tough when playing LPBs, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
<br> 
On a side note, I'd like to mention that my beloved Oregon State Beavers are but one win away from their first winning season since I was, oh, about two.  Which is, suffice it to say, a very long time.  We long-suffering OSU grads are just agog with the possibility of going to a bowl game.  My normal insufferability has been amped up about tenfold for all the UO grads here at Dynamix (and, lo, their numbers are legion).  Hail to the Beavers, hail to OSU...
<br>
Alas, the mission editor calls my name.  It's back to the grind, making more missions and plotting the doom of Scott Rudi so that I can take over his illustrious corner office and advance in the corporate hierarchy...whoops, forget you read that last part.  Nothing devious here to see, move along, move along...
