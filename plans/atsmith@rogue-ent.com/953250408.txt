It is a sad day indeed. 

It has come to my attention that my buds and clanmates in
Clan Crayola have recieved a cease and desist order from
the owners of Crayola Crayons.  Crayola Clan is to remove
all references of Crayola and the black swirl graphics from
the crayon graphics.  Also they are to give up the
Crayolaclan.com domain.

I guess I could understand it better if we were trying to
make a profit or public defame Crayola.  But we arent, and
I even went out of my way to make our website nice and
cheerful.

So I guess I'm looking for help from fellow gamers out there.
Please dont let this 4 year old clan of harmless outgoing
guys change everything they stand for!  Send emails to
Crayola.  Tell them that we have nothing but 'lub' for Crayola
and color creating wax sticks everywhere.

If only we had Sally Struthers and some TV commercial time....

I would give you a link to our page... but that would be bad.

..and that makes me a sad panda.
