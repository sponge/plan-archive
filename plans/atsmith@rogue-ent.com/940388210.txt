Hola!

Well my first week at Rogue has been great so far.  It took very
little time to get used to everything.  The guys here are great
at what they do, and are cool all around.  Except for that Rich guy.
I fear he is planning my demise.

Anyways, I'd like to suggest everyone go get that new NIN album
if you're into that kind of music.  Its definately one of the best
CDs I own.  And while you're at it, play Revenant!  That game is so
much more entertaining than Diablo ever was.  Hopefully the full game
will be even better than the demo (and have much fewer bugs).

I guess thats my personal ramblings for today.
