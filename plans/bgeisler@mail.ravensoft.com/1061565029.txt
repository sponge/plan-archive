Warning, this is a non-work related post!  

Madison Wisconsin, home of Raven Software also happens to have a growing and nationally recognized electro/synth/industrial underground music scene.  Bands like Stromken, Null Device and Stochastic Theory have their roots in this town.  DJ Eurotic has put together a compilation of local talent and it's really good! It's being carried by  <a href="http://foq.us/X122"> metropolis</a>.  Also available at the promoter's site: <a href="http://www.deadbeatproductions.com/"> http://www.deadbeatproductions.com/</a>.  This music  is inspiring at least one Quake 4 programmer, into the wee hours of the morning.  So you should all go out and get it!  ;)
