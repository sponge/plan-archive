In SOF2 land we're all cranking away, and sleep is becoming less and less
something that anyone around here has time for.  You guys are gonna love it...

In the words of the immortal Hannibal from A-Team: "I love it when a plan 
comes together!" ;) There's nothing that compares to playing the game you 
helped make, the AI helped code, and having it kick your ass.  Sure, it's 
kinda bothersome when you're trying to debug something and suddenly the guy 
throws your own grenade back at you, blowing you to bits.  Then you've got 
to wait for the level to reload.  But in the meantime you're somewhere between 
a feeling of elation and utter amazement that your plan actually worked.  

I haven't gotten outside of my little private heaven/hell very much.  But
I HAVE been playing some wolf MP this weekend.  Great game, team work is 
essential. My alma matter (UW-Madison) is offering a games programming course,
and I hear tell they will be using the lithtech engine.  Rather embarrassing, 
but I had never seen it in action.  So out of curiosity I checked out the AVP2 
demo this weekend.  Very sharp, it's nice to see the lithtech engine shine.

Outside of gaming, haven't been up to much.  Due to crunch time we paused our
weekly DnD game here at Raven.  Now I'm only playing once a month, any less 
than that and I'd probably go into withdrawal.  As a side note, does anyone 
have any decent general discussion forums (non-gaming) they might recommend?  
The discussion board on my favorite E/N site seems to have petered out, and 
turned into either a pickup joint or a place for bad poets to make fart jokes.
