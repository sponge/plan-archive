*pant* *pant* *pant* *pant*

Whew.  I just emerged from the other side of Crunch Mode,
bloodied but unbowed.

Last week, we sent off the Alpha version of Deus Ex to
Eidos and our Dallas office.  We all worked like dogs, but
we made our deadline!  Deus Ex is no longer a glorified
technology demo; now it's beginning to look like a game...

The AI is starting to look good.  I've spent most of the
last few weeks working on combat AI.  I've still got a lot
of work left to do, mostly in the arcane realm of
optimization.  I also need to differentiate the NPCs a bit
more; right now, they all fight the same way (albeit with
different weapons).  With luck, all of this will be done
before E3.

Speaking of E3...  I'll be there.  Look for the small,
bearded man.  No, not Warren -- the *other* small bearded
man.  The one with the thick Coke-bottle glasses, thinning
hair, stooped posture, pasty skin... oh yeah, and the
self-esteem problem.  :)

Hiya!

Been a while since I updated my .plan, so this'll be a
long one.

The user interface library is now pretty much done, barring
the usual tweaks and modifications I'm sure I'll make over
the next year.

This is not the same as saying the USER INTERFACE is done.
For the next few months Albert Yarusso will be building the
actual Deus Ex interface using the library I've written.
All I did was program the underlying windows.

Some of the features of the UI library:

- Full support for both keyboard and mouse traversal

- Text windows, pushbuttons, toggle buttons, radio buttons,
  checkboxes, scrolling areas, and many of the other basic
  controls of Windows

- A list window with multi-column support, auto-sorting,
  and single or multiple selection (this will be used in
  Deus Ex when selecting augmentations, loading and saving
  games, etc.)

- A notepad-style window with text editing capability,
  including full cursor movement, text selection,
  cut-and-paste buffers, and undo/redo (this will be
  used for Deus Ex's in-game notes and map annotation)

- Viewport windows that can render a 3D scene from any angle,
  and can be placed anywhere on the screen (imagine the
  possibilities...)

On February 1st I return to writing the game's artificial
intelligence, and none too soon.  Writing the UI library was
fun, but I'm *really* looking forward to getting my grubby
little paws into the AI again.

Sidebar:

I overcame my addiction to Half-Life just in time to become
addicted to Baldur's Gate.  If you're into RPGs at *all*,
I can't recommend this one enough.  It's got its fair share
of problems, but it's a remarkably stable product and it's
a lot of fun to play.  I've logged over 150 hours on it, and
I'm STILL not done.  Kudos to BioWare for a great game!

This probably won't make it to my .plan file in time, but just
in case it does...  Happy Thanksgiving!

I'm still working on the user interface.  Scrolling areas and
lists are done, and they rock.  (Betcha won't hear THAT in
future Deus Ex reviews!  :)  Now I'm in the process of adding
some new features to the list widgets, fixing a couple of
small bugs, and working on combo boxes.

I've spent the last four nights staying up 'til 4am playing
Half-Life.  This is the most addictive game I've played since
1988, when I was hooked on the original Phantasy Star for the
Sega Master System.  Half-Life is soooooo cool!  I'm in awe
of the sheer amount of DETAIL they put into that game!

Valve, I salute you!  Great job!

The final episode of Babylon 5 is on tonight.  Should be
a bittersweet departure for my favorite show.  Time to pull
out the Kleenex...

Work continues apace.  Scrollbars and sliders are nearly done,
and I should have scrolling areas working shortly thereafter.
Then I get to work on other fun widget stuff like lists,
checkboxes and combo boxes.  The UI is really starting to come
together, but I've got miles to go before I sleep...

Saw John Carpenter's Vampires today.  It wasn't bad -- lame-ish
plot, but lots of decent acting and great one-liners.

Had to put the UI on hold for a week while we integrated Deus Ex
with the latest version of Unreal.  Unfortunately, we had lots of
little niggling problems with the new version.  Now I get to work
extra hours to put myself back on schedule.  Yayyy!

Finished my Defensive Driving video course last night.  Aced the
exam, but failed the personal questions section they give you to
verify your identity.  I couldn't remember my previous phone
number or whether I was registered to vote.  *sigh*  I take some
small comfort in knowing that Einstein sometimes forgot his own
address...

But now at least I'll be a better driver.  Maybe when I'm on the
highway I won't feel obliged to roar past the slow cars, like the
big sixteen-wheelers or Warren's new STATION WAGON.

Yeah, like I have a plan.

I've put the AI on hold for a while.  I've started working on the
user interface library again, adding all those cool little widgets
that Albert's been asking me for.  At this rate, by the time I'm
done we'll have a windowing system in the Unreal engine that will
rival Microsoft's.  :)

Once the new widgets are done, I can concentrate full-time on the
AI.  I can't wait.  Writing window code is fun, but I've got some
kick-ass ideas for the AI that I'm dying to try out.

As I'm fond of saying, I'm not a workaholic, I'm a hedonist with
a fun job.
