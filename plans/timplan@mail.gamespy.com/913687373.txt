Plan:
Some sad personal news.  On Wednesday night my grandfather died after 88
years.  Almost made it to 89 because his birthday was Friday.  Consequently,
I had to go to Alabama for the funeral.

More upbeat.  GameSpy Java.  It is looking good.  Spent a lot of time
reading.  Got two books. One is the Java Master Reference.  Damn good book
if you want a reference on the classes (and I did).  It qualifies as a tome.
The second is Java Network Programming.  I found this fairly useful but
slightly out of date.  Has lots of snippets showing how to do something.
The two books together and the online help are helping me design this thing.

GameSpy Java can download a web page and launch a program (ie start quake).
Can't query anything yet.  Working on understanding and adding the
serialization for saving and loading the data as well as the design.  The
design is fairly easy, it is almost like GameSpy but there are occasional
gotchas.. Also trying to figure out how to draw my own icons in the tree
control.  The one thing I have not figured out is how to start a web
browser.  In Win32 it was easy.

GameSpy.  Joe has not sent me the 2.1 drop yet.  Not that it matters much.
Between the funeral and pneumonia, I have not had much time for anything.

Been playing Halflife.  So far, it is really good. I am at the Blast Pit.
