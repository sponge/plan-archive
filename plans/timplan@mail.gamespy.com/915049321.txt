Last update for the year.  Joe completed the 2.1 and 2.06 merge.  Added lots
of stuff to 2.1 over christmas.  More on that stuff closer to release.

Team GameSpy has been playing with the latest WinGate (version 3.0).
Results are showing it will allow you to run GameSpy, games, and anything
else from behind WinGate on your network.  Give it a try.  I may not need to
finish that router after all.

Watched the Jags whoop up on those Stealers.  I was very concerned it was
going to turn into the fog bowl.  At times, you could not see the fans
across the field.  Don't know how far the Jags will go in the playoffs.
They have a lot of injuries.

I gave my Mom one of my old computers.  Then the boot disk dies. Sigh.  It
has another drive but more work for me.

My old Pentium is going to be running Linux full time shortly.  Need to move
my quicken and pilot over to another computer.
