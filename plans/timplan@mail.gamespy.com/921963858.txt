Plan:
GameSpy - not much done on it this week.  I was taking a class Creating and
Managing Web Servers using IIS 4 class at night.  By Friday, my butt was
dragging.  Lessons learned:
1) Site Server Express is pretty cool.
2) The indexer does not work when you only have 2M free on the disk.  It
complains about not having enough disk space.  Go figure...
Next week is the InterDev class.

Got my linux machine running ip masq.

If you are planning on heading toward central florida or points south via
I-75, change your plans for the next few weeks.  A truck hit an overpass and
took out 3 out of 4 lanes somewhere near Gainesville.  Needless to say, it is a mess.
Go I-95 or travel with fresh engine coolant.

In the you-just-gotta-love-microsoft department.  Thursday IE5 was announced
and I went to try and download it from Microsoft. Clicked the download link
from the page extolling all the IE5 virtues and it says "You are running IE
4.01 which is the latest version."  I could download the small version off
Tucows but I could not get it from Microsoft.  Turns out to be a good thing
because there are reports that IE5 does not play well with Visual Studio and
MS will address those issues on a service pack this spring.  I guess that
laptop with the screwed up IE4 installation is going to get reinstalled.

Another one.  The Visual Studio which supports Win2K will not be out until
about six months after Win2k is released.  Good plan folks.  Question, with
what tool are you building it?
