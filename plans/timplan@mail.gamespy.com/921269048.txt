GameSpy - still working on it. ;-)  I had to get a new keyboard.

Finally got a new keyboard.  A Logitech Internet Keyboard.  Very nice feel.
Has lots of nice buttons (besides the keys) for handling browsers.  I have
not tested those.

Been having lots of fun with allergies.  The world was bouncing nicely
earlier in the week due to either an ear infection or being irritated.  It
is better now.

The car brakes was no real problem.  The parking brake switch casing had
partially dissolved.  My rear brakes were almost worn out.  After 82000
miles, I can't complain.  The front brakes were only about 50% worn.

Saw the new Episode 1 trailer this morning.  It is going to be an awsome
movie.  In case you have not seen it, besides the story line of the making
of Darth Vader, the old Republic is going to be overthrown by the Empire.
