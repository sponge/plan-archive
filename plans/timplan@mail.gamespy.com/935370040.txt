Finally a gamespy update!

For those sending me email asking support questions.  
We have a support here: http://www.gamespy.com/using/support.shtml
Please use it. I will be traveling a lot in the next few months and if you want or need
a reply in anything less than a week, I am not the one to contact.  I am also really 
busy working on 3.0.  Since I just forward the messages to tech support, save yourself
a possibly long delay.

The 3.0 engine is coming along nicely.  I am working on the bugs.  Not as numerous as
I thought they would be. ;-)  A good design goes a long way.

I have not decided whether to continue the Java stuff.  Don't have time right now. I 
do have another plan though. Maintaining two code bases never appeals to me.  
I made some changes in the C++ design.  The engine now uses multiple inheritance 
rather heavily and is something Java does not implement because the designers 
decided it was not useful.  Shows how wrong they can be.  BTW, I know about implements.
