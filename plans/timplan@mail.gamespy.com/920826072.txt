Plan:
GameSpy - finished the redesign of the gamespy engine and I now need to
merge it into the code base.  Not looking forward to that at all.  The merge
will really break some stuff we just got working again but in the end,
GameSpy will be better for it.

GameSpy Java - I have written all of the pieces now I need to assemble it.
The Java engine looks like the C++ engine.

Linux - downloaded GNOME and Enlightenment and installed them. Sorry folks,
they are not ready.  Windows just disappear and did not reappear until
shutdown.  Of course, it could just be Enlightenment which is a 0.15 level
product.

MegaCon - my sister, her husband, and a friend came down Friday and we went
to MegaCon which is a Sci-Fi, comic book collector type event on Friday and
Saturday.  Saturday, J. Michael Straczynski of Babylon 5 was there (the
reason I went). He discussed some B5 happenings and showed an episode of the
Crusade series starting in June.  It looks to be pretty good.

The bad news is on the way home the brake light came on in my Taurus.  It
has enough brake fluid so I am not sure why it is on but that is something
that will definitely get investigated.  The car has antilock brakes so it
could be lots of things.  It is braking fine though.
