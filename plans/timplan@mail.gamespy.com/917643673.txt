Plan:
GameSpy Java - cool stuff here.  Almost all of the pieces are written. Need
to put stuff together and begin debugging.  The HTML parser was very easy to
write in java and works better than GameSpy's.

GameSpy - 2.08 was almost ready then we got a new game to add and started
looking into why 2.07 was crashing with Unreal.  I can't duplicate the
problem.  I will say that 220 of Unreal is definately beta because Unreal
crashed.  I then started cleaning up some of the stuff I had already done in
2.1.  Also rewrote the HTML parser so it works as well as Java's. Pulled out
socks and set DirectPlay (DP) up to build in by flagging.
Speaking of DP, I may look at it for 2.1.  The problem is the DirectX6 SDK
is 225M compressed.  Sheesh.  I may have to remove a game or two.

WinRoute - continued playing with WinRoute.  Some notes:
1) Version 3.04 will NOT save the settings if you change them then reboot.
You need to close WinRoute manually.
2) Watch out for the autoconnection (dial on demand) setting on any of the
routers.  I went into the other room last week to watch TV and heard the
modem start dialing.  A PQ web page I left up in Linux decided it was time
for a new ad.
3) Hang up is bad too if the machine acting as the router is also being used
as a desktop also.  WinRoute does not seem to be smart enough not to hang it
up if nothing is happening on the protected side.  But this may be related
to 4...
4) When using WInRoute, dial within the program and don't use standard
dialup networking.

Linux 2.2.1 is out.  I may build my first Unix kernel.  Got to get some
GameSpy stuff out of the way first.

Last plan I stated "5) IPX/SPX.  There are very few things I hate in the
computer world but
Novell is one of them.  None of my computers has IPX installed.  That
seriously helps Windows stability."  I got one email trying to tell me the
glories of Novell.  Well, I did not back up the statement with some facts
and my experiences which leads me to say something like that.  Before I do
that, don't email me trying to convince me I am wrong.  When you see why,
you will understand.  On with the rant:

I don't have much against the concept of the Netware server.  I have major
disagreements with the way it is implemented in relation to the client. The
problem is the client is too bound to the server. When a server goes down,
for what ever reason, the client OS should never
stop responding or just crash.  Anytime I have had any dealings with the
netware client installed, I always have the problem.  Remove netware, the
problem goes away.  Gives new meaning to the misused phrase "the lan is
down."

So far I have only had two things that made NT unstable or crash.
1) Netscape 2.x and 3.x.  Gave up on them after 3.02 and used the really bad
IE2.  At least it did not crash NT.
2) Netware.  Connect to the netware share, email for example (cc:mail).  The
server goes down and NT has spasms.  It may recover (95 is a hard reboot at
this time).  It will definately need to reboot.  And cc:mail was NOT running
at the time. Furthermore it happened on several occasions.  If I got far
warning, I would run a script to disconnect the shares.

Another thing that pisses me off is Netware will pop a share into
my 95 laptop when creating directories on network share if I have NO netware
shares or
drives, just the client is installed.  Obviously it needs thinks I want to
login.  The part that angers me is the network drive I created the directory
on is the one replaced by netware.

Another item.  Using your laptop when not connected to a network.  Netware
insists it can't find a server to verify your login (no sh*t).  But it won't
give up and will continue to annoy you despite the fact you clicked cancel.
Definately not good when you are trying to demo for the customer at their
site.

Every major OS has problems.  I could go into several REALLY DUMB Microsoft
mistakes. For good measure here is one: Mistype your password in Win95.
Type it correctly the second time.  MS uses the wrong password when
reconnecting the shares.  Here is another: enter your password when it is
expired or wrong when connecting to a domain.  Your only recourse it to
reboot or enter an invalid domain name if you can't correct the password
because cancel does not work.

Have not found any in Linux yet but I am still a newbie with it.

The only consistant thing between Microsoft and Netware is they both don't
know when to take NO (cancel) for an answer.

Some words of wisdom for Microsoft and Netware (and others):
1) When I say No or Cancel, I mean just that.
2) If one connection failed to a server because the server is down, don't
annoy me about the rest of the shares to the same server.
3) When you have a multithreaded OS, realize I just may be doing something
else and popping up dialogs because something finished or failed is NOT
good.  Find another way to let me know.  Blink to task bar or set off sound
effect.
4) Splash screens are not a good thing, especially if they don't allow me to
do something else (ie Outlook).
5) If I have another window active and I am using it, never force your
window to the foreground.  The only window I can think of that needs to
force forward is the UPS letting you know the power is going out and how
long you have before it dies.  But use your head here too.  ICQ has a good
model here.
6) Microsoft - why is there not a "Yes to All" when changing network
settings?  Also, why are you wanting the Win CD when all of the pieces are
installed?  Check before asking for CDs.

Finished ranting now.
