GameSpy -
2.08 is out and that is (hopefully) the last of that series.
Next version (aka 2.10) - in progress. Been working on the monitor. I
redesigned it to look like the monitor we studied in Dr. Butler's Operating
Systems class at UNF.  This design is not far from being able to run
distributed.  All you would need is a thousand computers and a T1 network
then GameSpy could finish in about 3 seconds. Of course if you dedicated
that kind of resources to the problem, you should seek some help. Quake just
is not that important. ;-)
Java - been working on the above.  'nuff said.

Linux - updated to KDE 1.1 and Redhat 5.2.  Still learning about adding
non-rpm apps to it.  Next big project, building the 2.2.2 kernel.

HalfLife - almost finished. Kind of broke the keyboard space bar on my Dell
during one of those stupid jumping puzzles. Come on people, surely we can
build better puzzles than a test of keyboard skills that passes as a jumping
puzzle.  Of all of the things about first person shooter games, jumping
puzzles irritate me the most.

Installed Visual Studio 6 today.  Microsoft needs to learn how to install
software without rebooting.  It required at least five (5) reboots to
install. First for IE 4.01 update.  Just gotta have IE. Next for DCOM 98.
Another to uninstall VS 5. Another reboot after actual installation of VS6.
MSDN installs without a reboot. But SP2 for VS6 requires one more.  If you
have J++ you have one more before installation.

I know it is possible to install software without rebooting because Linux
can do it.  I was changing Samba's configuration and restarted it several
times without rebooting once.  Try mucking with Windows network setting and
you almost guaranteed to reboot. Still have not figured out how to create a
share yet.  I think I know but need some time.

Learned something else.  LinkSys PCMCIA network cards can't run for a week
without cooling off.  Of course, it may be just going bad.
