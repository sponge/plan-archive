GameSpy - been getting questions about why GameSpy has trouble launching
Unreal games.  Found out the way GameSpy launches Unreal is only supported
with IE4.  Netscape, IE3, or other browsers were out of luck.  Well, I fixed
it so look for a new release soon.

Linux - last time I stated Gnome and Enlightenment (E) were not ready.
Looks like it was E.
KDE has a wierd problem too. I activated the world clock and now every time
I start KDE, it fires back up.  If someone has a good reason why and a fix,
I would love to hear it.
