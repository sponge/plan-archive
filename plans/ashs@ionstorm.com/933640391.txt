Not this rumor stuff again ;)

It's true, I am leaving ION, but only 
for boring personal reasons, I'm afraid.  
I've had a lot of fun working at ION for 
the past few months.  I got to add a lot 
of cool tech to DK, and now that that's 
done, I'm heading back to Cali.  It's 
been cool working with John and everyone 
else here, and I wish them all the best!  

Now go away!
