Hey there, I need your help! I'm looking for an old hard disk that someone would want to part with, to use as spare parts in recovering some old data (mostly Doom maps) that are on an old broken HD of mine.
Here's the spec:

Western Digital Caviar 2420
989 cyl, 15 heads, 56spt, 425.3MB
MDL: WDAC2420-00F
It is a FAT 16 drive...

Anything with an identical logic board will do though. Although most these drives are redundant now, I'll gladly pay a hundred bucks or so for one...
