It puts some full-prize                                        products to shame too for                                        that matter. Damn thing                                        kept me awake all night                                        when I really should have                                        been doing other stuff,                                        but it was so well put                                        together I don't feel bad                                        at all. :) The new                                        weapons were well thought                                        out and oh so satisfying.                                        In addition they seemed                                        to go a long way in                                        evening out the sorry                                        balance of the Quake                                        weapons.

The new                                        monsters also added a lot                                        of much needed flavour to                                        the Quake menangerie. I                                        particularily enjoyed the                                        shielded soldiers (even                                        though their sounds were                                        bad) and the Turrets                                        (which usually don't work                                        to well) were truly                                        great.

Been searching the net for                                Commodore 64 artifacts and came                                across an emulator for that                                baby's sound-chip,                                &quot;SID&quot;.

Myself and Romero were chatting                                at the Daikatana-booth when this                                dude came up and asked for                                Romero's autograph. Who's the                                dude? Stavros Friggin' Fasoulas!!                                When Romero asked who to write                                the autograph to, he almost                                dropped his pen at the reply.

The task proved                                impossible though, because of the                                lack of source-code (Stavrous                                wrote his games directly in                                machine-code).
