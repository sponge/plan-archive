  Moving Day!  I'm participating in an office swap with
Lincoln and MarkB tomorrow, so it's office cleanout time.
Since I'm a big fan of metrics of any sort, this gives me an
excuse to count all the junk in my office.  Here's some of
the more interesting statistics:

Books of a Technical Nature: 49
  Top author: Donald E. Knuth with 4.  If you count "The Art
of Computer Programming" Vols. 1-3 as one book, then the nod
goes to Steve McConnell with 3.

Books of a more frivolous sort: 7.
  Top author, Robert E. Heinlein, 2.  Notable runners up,
Neil Gaiman and Larry Niven, one apiece.

Manuals: Not counted.
  Who reads these anyways?

Computers: 2
Monitors:  3
Speakers:  9
Keyboards: 3
  One non-functioning due to unfortunate soda spill.

CDs: "His name is Legion."

Operating systems: 5
  WinNT 4.0, Win98, Win95, RedHat Linux 5.2, BeOS R4.

Diet Coke cans: 22 (about 5 days worth)

Video cards: 24
  Broken down as follows:  (includes 2 on loan)

  Riva 128 (incl. ZX): 3
  Banshee:             1
  Voodoo2's:           2
  Voodoo1:             1 (non-functional)
  Voodoo Rush:         2
  G200:                1
  Riva TNT:            2
  Rage 128:            2
  Permidia2:           1
  Verite 2x00 (PCI):   2
  Verite 1000:         1
  i740:                4
  PCX2:                1
  Secret:              1

Video Card Static Shield Bags: about 50.
  I have no explanation for this.  My theory is they
undergo mitosis at night when empty.

  Awards go to nVidia for "Coolest Development Kit,"
for the Shiny Metal Thing that came with the Riva 128, and
to 3Dfx for "Coolest Heat Sink" for the Green Plateau with
Tunnels on the Banshee developer's board.
