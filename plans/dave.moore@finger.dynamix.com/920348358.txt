  A couple of clarifications to my earlier
.plan update.  I omitted mention of the
Permidia3 and the Rage 128.  Both of these
seem quite promising for TRIBES, and as
soon as I have boards, I'll make a status
update on them.

  Also, I've received a passel of eMails
that have convinced me that I need to
reiterate that we are NOT blaming id for our
current problems.  As I noted in an earlier
.plan, were it not for them, we'd be doing
all this in DirectX 3, and I would be
contemplating how to remove the Thermopane
windows from my office for the quick trip to
ground level.  My apologies to id for not
making this clear enough before.

  Late breaking developments re: OpenGL
make it look like we'll have some sort of
decision on our final direction for TRIBES
wide card support within the week, stay tuned.
