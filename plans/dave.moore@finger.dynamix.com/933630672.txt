  Erk!  Ok, there have been reports of palette problems
on 3dfx cards with only one TMU (Voodoo Graphics, Rush,
Banshee).  Mea maxima culpa, all my fault.  I goofed a
logic test (Morgan's law?  Something like that.  The one
that goes ![A && B] => [!A || !B]).  We're aware of the
problem, and a fix is in QA at this time.  This is
especially embarrassing, since 1.7 was supposed to fix
a palette problem on Voodoo 2's and Voodoo 3's.  Sigh.
