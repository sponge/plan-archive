  Eek!  I guess some folks are writing their chip manufacturers
as a result of my .plan.  Please folks, direct all irate comments
my way.  The folks at nVidia and Matrox (and all the other card
developers that we deal with) are bending over backwards to help
out with the port.  In addition, Sim D. at nVidia has made
a few suggestions since my update that have helped our preformance
on the TNT considerably.  It's looking more likely than ever that
I'll have to eat my words here.  Please be patient, as MarkF said,
it's Real Soon Now.

  Speaking of eating my words, on a completely different subject
skin designers should ignore my previous instructions.  Please use
only Palette 3 from the Skin tools for designing custom skins.
TimG reminded me that all of the damage bitmaps applied to the
armors are mapped in pal3, and will show up as multicolor splotches
on an armor mapped to a different palette.  There are (hopefully)
enough colors in pal3 to keep everybody happy.  My bad.
