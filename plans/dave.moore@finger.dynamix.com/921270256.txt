  I promised an update on the new cards we're working on,
I've been a bit lax.  Just wanted to quickly note that I've
been working on making sure the Rage 128 works with TRIBES.
To cut things short, it does.  For TRIBES, with the drivers
I've been using, I've been very impressed.  There don't
seem to be any more pauses or "hitching" than on my Voodoo2.
That's unfortunately a qualitative impression right now, but
we're thinking about adding some sort of demo timing feature
to TRIBES so we can begin to post some more solid numbers.
The dithering artifacts in 16-bit mode are a bit more
noticable than on the TNT, but nothing to sweat over.

  TRIBES as it sits now (@1.3), may work with the public
version of the 128 drivers if you set the game up for the
i740, though you'll notice the same black lines on the
terrain as with the G200. This will be corrected in the next
release of their OpenGL ICD, when the texture_edge_clamp
extension is merged into the released drivers.  Apparently
there exists a problem with polys close to the viewplane in
the Win9X version of the driver (doesn't happen on NT, which
I've been using), but if you can live with this, give it a
shot!
