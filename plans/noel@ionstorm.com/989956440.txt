        "The Man"
This is my last posting for a very long  time will
        mark this one day in memory of Doug Myres.  He was a good friend...
        and a loved soul.  We are all going to miss him
        greatly. 
Doug, wherever you are, I hope you have all of the
        beach, sun, and fun that you can handle for an eternity.  Walk
        along the shores of Australia, fish the greatest lakes, hike the tallest
        mountains, and may you be greeted with the same amount of love and
        warmth as you have greeted everyone in your life.


We loved ya man!-Noel
