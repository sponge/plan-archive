      I have been working on the foreign version of the patches.&nbsp; We are
      next to complete on these as they need to be tested and approved.&nbsp;
      Once this is done they should be posted for download.&nbsp; Along these
      same lines, the 1.1 English version to the 1.2 English version patch
      should come out around the same time... perhaps a little earlier due to
      the fact that the differences between 1.1 to 1.2 are so minor it shouldn't
      take as long to test.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now for the dirty stuff!&nbsp; &gt;:)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ok, ION Austin is a party group.&nbsp; No
      let me re-state this... ION Austin is a bunch of animals that you can hold
      a highly intelligent conversation with... uh... that is if you are not too
      blasted to understand them.&nbsp; Yes, this all can mean one thing: I went
      to the ION Austin party and was very much impressed.&nbsp; Not only did I
      get to see Warren sing, but I also got a chance to kick it with Satan's
      Cheerleaders.&nbsp; Those girlZ are a nasty bunch... and I do mean that in
      a very good way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ok, so I am not going to give away a URL,
      but I imagine that sooner or later Killcreek is gonna send out the URL to
      her collection of 'pictures' from the party.&nbsp; I would like to take
      this time to post a disclaimer about a particular picture of me...&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="5">yes it is that big.&nbsp; :P</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With all of that said, I would like to
      thank the Austin team for not only one of the most kick ass games but for
      one hell of a good time... and I do mean I had a good time!&nbsp; Hey, it
      isn't every day that you get to Wake board all day, hang out on a house
      boat, kick it at a bar with Satan's Cheerleaders, and then finally end the
      evening with a small little party over at Chris Robert's 'little house'...
      OMG it is HUGE!&nbsp; (if you ever go there watch out for attack trained
      cats with no tails... MEOW!)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh yeah... Russ.. next time you try to jump
      your boat off of a rock make sure there is WATER on the other side... it
      helps.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; (Really though... we are all glad you didn't kill
      yourself... )</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">GWOG... too bad we didn't get more time to
      chat but the bar keeps were busy filling me with shots... ;)</font></p>

      <font color="#FF0000">Good point...</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, after much debate, I have decided to
      let him go... yes it was a tough choice, but I think in the end we all
      know that it was the best thing to do...besides think of all the free
      Crawfish I will be getting out of the deal!&nbsp; It beats the hell out of
      Spam and a half eaten Twinkie!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So anyways on the other side of town...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I got a great chance to wake board this
      weekend.&nbsp; I might have to add that I had a complete and total
      blast!&nbsp; Wake boarding is one of those sports that once you start it
      kind of digs its claws into your spine until you can't stop thinking about
      it.&nbsp; Anywho, I did much better this last time.&nbsp; Once I can start
      catching good air I might have some pictures taken and post them up!&nbsp;
      I should get some of Mark Fletcher so you can see his Silver Surfer style
      jumping, but I will let him decide if he wants the public to see him... he
      is kinda shy like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Everything else is going great and is right
      on track.&nbsp; Until next time...&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As far as this weekend, I would like to

      and well I haven't gotten out too much lately so I would like to say
      thanks again:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;On another note, I am going to start
      investing in pain killers of one form or another... got up on a wake board
      this weekend thanks to Mark Fletcher's kick ass boat and both Mark and
      Bill's good advice.&nbsp; However, I think yesterday and today I have come
      to realize the actual amount of pressure exerted upon one's arms when
      being pulled up out of the water... my arms are toasted.&nbsp; It is like
      a challenge to type and stuff... grrr.&nbsp; Welp, just means I need to
      work out more...*sigh* but I will tell you what, getting up on a wake

    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ok ok...&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps my little 'blurb' on the Mark Fletcher thing
      was taken the wrong way.&nbsp; While I know there are TONS of people out
      there that are extremely great level designers, programmers, and artists
      which have all helped in creating the Doom2 community, I also know that
      there is one angle that a lot of people forget when they think of the
      Doom2 community.&nbsp; This would be the people who played the game to the
      point of perfection.&nbsp; You know, how Thresh started his virtual
      athlete career( He would also be a good source to pull from).&nbsp; For
      those of you who relate Thresh to Quake his real virtual athlete career
      started with the&nbsp; Deathmatch 95 tournament in Redmond Washington at
      the Microsoft campus grounds where he beat Merlock.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, my point being that if they want to capture the
      true Doom feel they should also pull from the very best Doom 'competitors'
      in the community.&nbsp; The best, just proven at the last Doom Deathmatch
      contest, is obviously Mark Fletcher, and I would bet that Mark (although I
      don't speak for him directly) would be more than happy to show any poor
      sod what playing Doom or Doom2 is all about.&nbsp; He is, by far, the
      absolute best player in the community and has the best idea of what the
      next generation Doom should feel and play like from a player's
      perspective.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, there are tons of people who I am sure
      will all be very willing and ready to help id Software re-capture that
      something special that Doom contains and still does contain to this very
      day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

      attempting to recover my body muscle tissue after the 7 day a week, 14
      hour a day, 9 month death schedule.&nbsp; It is amazing what kind of
      freaked out stances our instructor can get us into.&nbsp; Last night was a
      transfer from the Arrow stance to the Cat stance.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As far as the Doom 2000 thing... I sure do
      hope John C. plans on picking Mark Fletcher's brain COMPLETELY while
      making the game.&nbsp; Mark is, and I am sure that the community will
      agree, THE MAN to go to if you want to make the next generation Doom
      2000.&nbsp; I think the rest of the Doom community will definitely say
      that while Quake and all of the predecessors are great games, none ever
      matched the quick 'twitch' play of Doom or Doom2.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On a final note, I would like to send out a
      major thanks to Bioware for making MDK 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just had to say
      that I have been playing that game on the Dreamcast for almost a month now
      (perhaps a little longer) and have had a complete blast!&nbsp; You guys
      did a great job!&nbsp; If you haven't played MDK 2, and you like hard core

      w00d with MDK 2.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Daikatana has hit the shelves!&nbsp; Along
      with this comes the inevitable... the dreaded patch.&nbsp; However, never
      fear too much regarding this.&nbsp; ChalreZ, Shawn, and of course myself
      have been working on fixes for things that we have come to discover since
      the demo release on the code side, and I know the mappers have been adding
      some fixes and a few extra goodies to make the patch that much more
      welcome when it is released. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As far as Shawn and Charles are concerned,
      I know they have both been working in their 'areas' as I have been working
      on AI, World, and of course Sidekick related issues.&nbsp; Some of the
      windows 2000 issues that have been solved are relating to level
      transitions and I know Shawn is working on one particular load game issue
      under Win2k.&nbsp; So, if you are running 2000 and have had some crashes
      when transitioning from one level to the next, don't freak too much... the
      fix is coming soon.</font>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2">As for things
      relating to the Sidekicks, well one of the additions that I have added is
      the ability for them to use those nifty health trees, medical kits
      (episode 4), and of course the various forms of the hosportal (in episode
      2 it is the fountain of life). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On another note, things have been quite a
      change in pace and I think everyone is just 'adjusting' back to a normal
      schedule.&nbsp; It is times like these that make me understand the whole
      game developer's cycle and why there are times of complete chaos and then
      there are times of nice peaceful bliss.&nbsp; Either way, it is one
      fantastic ride.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am sure there will be a good handful of
      bugs sent our way once Daikatana gets into full circulation.&nbsp; As for
      when the patch is going to be released?&nbsp; Can't say... because it is
      really a matter of how many more bugs pop up between now and the next few
      weeks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, I would like to send out a special
      thanks to the entire Daikatana community for being so patient in waiting
      for Daikatana.&nbsp; I hope that we have made all of your waiting worth
      while.&nbsp; Enjoy!&nbsp; </font></p>
