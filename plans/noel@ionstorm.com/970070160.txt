It seems there has been a little confusion
      with the patches and what they do fix and what they do not fix. 
      There was a little bit of confusion due to the fact that we released a
      U.S. 1.0 to 1.1 patch and then realized that we might as well just release
      the 1.0 to 1.2 for the foreign versions due to the latency between
      releases.  Thus, if you have the U.S. version then both the 1.0 to
      1.1 and the 1.1 to 1.2 will contain all of the below fixes.  If you
      have any other version and you obtain a patch for it then all of the below
      fixes will be in that one patch.  (i.e. UK, Italian, French, German,
      Spanish)



Daikatana
      Patch

      Fixes (<1.0 to 1.1 & 1.1 to 1.2 US> <1.0 to 1.2 all

Here's
      the list of Bug Fixes and Additions to Daikatana that are contained in
      this patch.  To apply this
