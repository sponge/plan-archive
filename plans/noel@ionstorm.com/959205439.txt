      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Daikatana has hit the shelves!&nbsp; Along
      with this comes the inevitable... the dreaded patch.&nbsp; However, never
      fear too much regarding this.&nbsp; ChalreZ, Shawn, and of course myself
      have been working on fixes for things that we have come to discover since
      the demo release on the code side, and I know the mappers have been adding
      some fixes and a few extra goodies to make the patch that much more
      welcome when it is released. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As far as Shawn and Charles are concerned,
      I know they have both been working in their 'areas' as I have been working
      on AI, World, and of course Sidekick related issues.&nbsp; Some of the
      windows 2000 issues that have been solved are relating to level
      transitions and I know Shawn is working on one particular load game issue
      under Win2k.&nbsp; So, if you are running 2000 and have had some crashes
      when transitioning from one level to the next, don't freak too much... the
      fix is coming soon.</font>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2">As for things
      relating to the Sidekicks, well one of the additions that I have added is
      the ability for them to use those nifty health trees, medical kits
      (episode 4), and of course the various forms of the hosportal (in episode
      2 it is the fountain of life). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On another note, things have been quite a
      change in pace and I think everyone is just 'adjusting' back to a normal
      schedule.&nbsp; It is times like these that make me understand the whole
      game developer's cycle and why there are times of complete chaos and then
      there are times of nice peaceful bliss.&nbsp; Either way, it is one
      fantastic ride.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am sure there will be a good handful of
      bugs sent our way once Daikatana gets into full circulation.&nbsp; As for
      when the patch is going to be released?&nbsp; Can't say... because it is
      really a matter of how many more bugs pop up between now and the next few
      weeks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, I would like to send out a special
      thanks to the entire Daikatana community for being so patient in waiting
      for Daikatana.&nbsp; I hope that we have made all of your waiting worth
      while.&nbsp; Enjoy!&nbsp; </font></p>
