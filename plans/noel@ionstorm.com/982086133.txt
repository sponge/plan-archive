        Okies,<br>
        I was reading a kind of cool article at:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.3dactionplanet.com/features/articles/community/">http://www.3dactionplanet.com/features/articles/community/<br>
        </a>This led me to start thinking about many other aspects of the
        community that formed and is still around in regards to the Daikatana
        user base.&nbsp; I went from trying to get out of the office and into
        the real world as much as possible back into a mild crunch for some
        demos and patches.&nbsp; Then from here we are back into another (more
        milder) crunch for Anachronox.&nbsp; However, I didn't know if anyone,
        or myself for that matter, thanked all of the people who helped make the
        Daikatana community what it is/was.&nbsp; So, deep from the bottom of my
        groins, I am sending out a thanks to everyone that had anything to do
        with Daikatana.&nbsp; *gooo*</font><p>&nbsp;<p><font size="2" face="Arial">L8TRZ</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">-N03L</font>

        Part II<br>
        =============================================================================<br>
        Ok<font color="#00FF00">,<br>
        So it seems that Benjamin Wartel had some VERY interesting things to say
        about this as well.&nbsp; Although I have to admit that both sound as if
        they are heading down the same path.&nbsp;</font></font>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;<font color="#00FFFF">I've seen a
        meaning for the title of this movie in a few reviews. All say that the
        title is an ancient Chinese proverb. crouching tiger, hidden dragon gets
        its name from a chinese proverb that refers to hidden heroes that emerge
        from the fact that nothing is in fact what it seems.&nbsp; The title
        Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon draws upon an ancient Chinese saying, a
        proverb used to characterise situations and places where hidden heroes
        and legends dwell; a place where nothing is as it seems. Crouching
        Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an old Chinese proverb that means &quot;what you
        see isn't what you always get&quot;.</font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#00FFFF" face="Arial" size="2">Sorry, I know this is
        getting a bit repetitive, but I wanted to give you an idea of how often
        this explanation is used for the title of this movie.&nbsp; Also,
        directly frong Ang Lee:&nbsp;<br>
        Ang Lee: Well, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the name of the novel
        which we adapted from. And this proverb is used to characterize
        situations and places wherein there dwell hidden heroes and legends, and
        where nothing is as it seems.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#00FFFF" face="Arial" size="2">I saw another translation
        of the proverb which said it means to never trust a pretty face, but I
        would doubt that is the correct translation.</font><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, I would guess that the former is a
        more accurate depiction of what the title could mean or does mean.&nbsp;
        However, I got one real question... who knows the actress who played Jen
        and how does one go about meeting someone like that!&nbsp; I am one
        crouching tiger that has a hidden dragon for her!&nbsp;
        (reeeooorrrrr)&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;:)</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
        =============================================================================<br>
        Part I<br>
        =============================================================================<br>
        Wow,<br>
        Well I stand corrected.&nbsp; It appears that Ryan has a some insight to
        the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon title:</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;</font>
        <div>
          <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF">You've got it backwards, Jen is the
          Crouching tiger, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle
          Yeoh) are the hidden dragons. Possibly Jade Fox (Pei-pei Cheng) is the
          Dragon. Why? In Oriental philosophy, the Tiger reacts to his
          situation, lashing out and striking with awesome fury, but lacks
          forethought and can get trapped. The Dragon takes his time and has
          options as&nbsp;to which path he will take when (if) he chooses to
          strike, and always has an alternate plan.</font>
        </div>
        <div>
          <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FFFF">&nbsp;</font>
        </div>
        <div>
          <font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#00FFFF">The scene in the resturant where jen
          attacks all the fighters who just wnated a lesson typifies this.Li Mu
          Bai always being a step ahead of Jen shows him as a dragon as well
          .</font>&quot;</font>
        </div>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So, there you have it.&nbsp; Unless
        someone else can come up with a better theory... then I am gonna run
        with this.&nbsp; Sounds like he knows what he is talking about... anyone
        care to challenge this?&nbsp; :)</font><p>&nbsp;<p><font size="2" face="Arial">L8TRZ</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">-N03L</font>

        There is this movie...Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.&nbsp; I have to
        admit, it is probably one of my all time favorite 'Kung Fu' flicks of
        all time.&nbsp; Even though it is sub-titled, which can sometimes force
        one to have to watch a movies a few times in order to get the entire
        gist of the ordeal, this one was quite pleasant.&nbsp; If you haven't

        Now I get this email from Luke and Tom screaming and yelling at the top
        of their keyboard lungs!&nbsp; Chrono Trigger PSX-2 they say!&nbsp; The
        images of high-poly rendered chrono trigger characters start flowing
        like a river of chocolate milk through my mind.&nbsp; The thought raises
        the hair on the back of my neck.&nbsp; Yes... Squaresoft is looking to
        the people of the community to determine if there is a market for Chrono
        Trigger... if you never played Chrono Trigger then you have definitely
        missed out on one of the better games of the 90's.&nbsp; So, if you are
        a fanatical RPG future-fantasy buff like myself then you need to jot out
        a quick email to Squaresoft and tell them that you would be interested
        in something like this... even if you aren't really sure but you might
        even consider it I would send them an email... Where do you send an
        email to ?</font><p><font SIZE="2"><a href="mailto:support@squaresoft.com">support@squaresoft.com</a></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">So,
        send it off... get them all pumped up... and maybe... just maybe ... we
        will see one of the better games get even BETTER!</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh
        yeah... have one of those Merry Type Christmas times with all that
        present tearing, food filling, family gathering type stuff... and if I
        don't get to the ol' .plan file before the new year.&nbsp; Everyone have
        a good time... but for God's sake be smart about your 'partying' and
        keep safe.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hmmm, and on another
        note... there was a minor save game issue that I was just made aware of
        concerning Daikatana and Wyndrax.&nbsp; It appears that there is a
        possible 'time' that you can save the game on the Wyndrax level (right
        before you get to him) that can get corrupted.&nbsp; This will cause the
        game to crash if you try to fight him from a load game... and I say this
        with extreme caution ... because I need to take a much closer look at
        the problem.&nbsp; If I get a chance, after the New year, I will see
        what can be done.&nbsp; For now, if you have been running into this
        problem and have a save game before the Wyndrax level then load that and
        try to play through the Wyndrax level without a save... hahaha... hey it
        makes it that much more of a challenge!&nbsp; :)</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Until

      There was a little bit of confusion due to the fact that we released a

      the 1.0 to 1.2 for the foreign versions due to the latency between
      releases.&nbsp; Thus, if you have the U.S. version then both the 1.0 to
      1.1 and the 1.1 to 1.2 will contain all of the below fixes.&nbsp; If you
      have any other version and you obtain a patch for it then all of the below

      modifications feel free to write to me and let me know what you have
      done.&nbsp; I am always up for discussion as to what are better methods to
      doing something or reading other people's opinions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ok, now for my political rants and
      raves.&nbsp; I thought of an idea that might help us come to a middle
      grounds with the whole FDA testing process and death row/prisons.&nbsp; Why don't
      we just turn people who are on death row into cases for the FDA to be
      able to run tests on new products under question?&nbsp; Along these same
      lines, we all know the infamous white lab rat-mice who showed signs of
      cancer when being exposed to saccharin products (i.e Sweet &amp; Low,
      etc...) , so we come to find out that only the lab rat-mice react to it in the
      manner that they did and that it does not have the same effects on
      humans.&nbsp; Why don't we just bypass this whole rat thing and start
      running tests on food products through the prisons?&nbsp; Not only would
      food processing companies get a plethora of test cases, but our cost to
      supplying goods like food, clothing, soaps, etc.. would be cut down.&nbsp;
      The companies could use this as a tax write off and the prisons could
      redirect the funds towards helping rehabilitate prisoners.&nbsp; I know
      this sounds cruel, but then again most people that are in prisons are
      there because they did something completely wrong and they are paying the
      price for it...or are they?&nbsp; You see, we pay the taxes thus we pay
      for them to hang out in prison.&nbsp; If we are paying to have them there
      then why can't they do something in return as favor towards a society who
      is paying to keep them alive?&nbsp; If they use themselves as test platforms for new products
      (etc..) then they can not only make amends for their illegal activities
      but they could possibly help someone who isn't a thief or a murderer&nbsp;
      live a longer healthier life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I don't think this is the ultimate plan,
      but I do think we need to start looking at other more radical solutions to
      our current everyday sociological problems.&nbsp; I realize these methods
      sound radical and almost 'nazi', however there are problems that we are
      coming to in the near future that I don't think most Americans
      realize.&nbsp; Most Americans feel that we should try preserving life at
      whatever cost possible.&nbsp; Even if the one life has taken several lives
      from its own actions we still find people wanting to preserve that one
      life.&nbsp; The only 'pro' I can see from this attitude is
      'pro-murder'.&nbsp; Sure, in effect what we are doing is no better than
      the person's crime itself if we support death row or even the theory
      introduced above, but the other way to look at it is all of the lives that
      will be saved by sacrificing the one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

      can give me a couple hundred million dollars and I promise not to let him
      loose onto our community again...or I can get my Spam and my half eaten

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As far as this weekend, I would like to
      thank Adrian C. for his warm open hospitality... we all had a great time
      and well I haven't gotten out too much lately so I would like to say
      thanks again:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;On another note, I am going to start
      investing in pain killers of one form or another... got up on a wake board
      this weekend thanks to Mark Fletcher's kick ass boat and both Mark and
      Bill's good advice.&nbsp; However, I think yesterday and today I have come
      to realize the actual amount of pressure exerted upon one's arms when
      being pulled up out of the water... my arms are toasted.&nbsp; It is like
      a challenge to type and stuff... grrr.&nbsp; Welp, just means I need to
      work out more...*sigh* but I will tell you what, getting up on a wake
      board is a pretty kick-ass feeling!</font></p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps my little 'blurb' on the Mark Fletcher thing
      was taken the wrong way.&nbsp; While I know there are TONS of people out
      there that are extremely great level designers, programmers, and artists
      which have all helped in creating the Doom2 community, I also know that
      there is one angle that a lot of people forget when they think of the
      Doom2 community.&nbsp; This would be the people who played the game to the
      point of perfection.&nbsp; You know, how Thresh started his virtual
      athlete career( He would also be a good source to pull from).&nbsp; For
      those of you who relate Thresh to Quake his real virtual athlete career
      started with the&nbsp; Deathmatch 95 tournament in Redmond Washington at
      the Microsoft campus grounds where he beat Merlock.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, my point being that if they want to capture the
      true Doom feel they should also pull from the very best Doom 'competitors'
      in the community.&nbsp; The best, just proven at the last Doom Deathmatch
      contest, is obviously Mark Fletcher, and I would bet that Mark (although I
      don't speak for him directly) would be more than happy to show any poor
      sod what playing Doom or Doom2 is all about.&nbsp; He is, by far, the
      absolute best player in the community and has the best idea of what the
      next generation Doom should feel and play like from a player's
      perspective.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, there are tons of people who I am sure
      will all be very willing and ready to help id Software re-capture that
      something special that Doom contains and still does contain to this very
      day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

      Friday...although I am quite sore from my Kung Fu class last night( I
      would bet that Shawn is feeling the same way).&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I am
      attempting to recover my body muscle tissue after the 7 day a week, 14
      hour a day, 9 month death schedule.&nbsp; It is amazing what kind of
      freaked out stances our instructor can get us into.&nbsp; Last night was a
      transfer from the Arrow stance to the Cat stance.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As far as the Doom 2000 thing... I sure do
      hope John C. plans on picking Mark Fletcher's brain COMPLETELY while
      making the game.&nbsp; Mark is, and I am sure that the community will
      agree, THE MAN to go to if you want to make the next generation Doom
      2000.&nbsp; I think the rest of the Doom community will definitely say
      that while Quake and all of the predecessors are great games, none ever
      matched the quick 'twitch' play of Doom or Doom2.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On a final note, I would like to send out a
      major thanks to Bioware for making MDK 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just had to say
      that I have been playing that game on the Dreamcast for almost a month now
      (perhaps a little longer) and have had a complete blast!&nbsp; You guys
      did a great job!&nbsp; If you haven't played MDK 2, and you like hard core
      action, cool puzzles, and whacked out humor... then you are gonna spring
      w00d with MDK 2.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Daikatana has hit the shelves!&nbsp; Along
      with this comes the inevitable... the dreaded patch.&nbsp; However, never
      fear too much regarding this.&nbsp; ChalreZ, Shawn, and of course myself
      have been working on fixes for things that we have come to discover since
      the demo release on the code side, and I know the mappers have been adding
      some fixes and a few extra goodies to make the patch that much more
      welcome when it is released. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As far as Shawn and Charles are concerned,
      I know they have both been working in their 'areas' as I have been working
      on AI, World, and of course Sidekick related issues.&nbsp; Some of the
      windows 2000 issues that have been solved are relating to level
      transitions and I know Shawn is working on one particular load game issue
      under Win2k.&nbsp; So, if you are running 2000 and have had some crashes
      when transitioning from one level to the next, don't freak too much... the
      fix is coming soon.</font>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2">As for things
      relating to the Sidekicks, well one of the additions that I have added is
      the ability for them to use those nifty health trees, medical kits
      (episode 4), and of course the various forms of the hosportal (in episode
      2 it is the fountain of life). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On another note, things have been quite a
      change in pace and I think everyone is just 'adjusting' back to a normal
      schedule.&nbsp; It is times like these that make me understand the whole
      game developer's cycle and why there are times of complete chaos and then
      there are times of nice peaceful bliss.&nbsp; Either way, it is one
      fantastic ride.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am sure there will be a good handful of
      bugs sent our way once Daikatana gets into full circulation.&nbsp; As for
      when the patch is going to be released?&nbsp; Can't say... because it is
      really a matter of how many more bugs pop up between now and the next few
      weeks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, I would like to send out a special
      thanks to the entire Daikatana community for being so patient in waiting
      for Daikatana.&nbsp; I hope that we have made all of your waiting worth
      while.&nbsp; Enjoy!&nbsp; </font></p>
