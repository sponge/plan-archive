      So there has been a little bit of &lt; ehum&gt; latency in the testing
      over this weekend.&nbsp; Things are still on track with Daikatana, and the
      programmers are done.&nbsp; Unless something horrid happens and we
      absolutely have to modify the code then we will do so, but as of right now
      we are mainly here just as a 'safety' net.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Don't panic... :)</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">On another more important note, heh,
      I have come to my senses and decided to postpone my Thailand trip to
      Phuket until sometime later this year... I was looking around at some of
      the airfares and discovered that you are SOL if you want to fly to
      Thailand and only have a 2 week notice... like $5k round trip.&nbsp; *yipe*</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">I appreciate all of the feedback
      that people sent to me regarding Phuket.&nbsp; I also got a good deal of
      mail regarding some people trying to boycott Thailand due to it is supposed
      to be a </font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">pedophiliac safe haven/
      place to go.&nbsp; Well, uh... I am not a pedophile nor do I intend to be,
      however trying to boycott a place because something like that is occurring
      is not the solution.&nbsp; That would be like saying we should boycott all
      of the countries that produce cocaine&nbsp; and </font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">marijuana
      because our children are suffering greatly from it.&nbsp; That doesn't fix
      the problem.&nbsp; The problem (in the later example) is that there are a
      few bad apples that need to be plucked from the tree.&nbsp; If we were to
      boycott everything that did bad things to 'humans' then what would we have
      left?&nbsp; Where would we go?&nbsp; Boycotting something is the same as
      running from it or turning your back on the problem, which in my eyes is
      worse than doing something positive about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Either way,
      don't email me about it, I gave at the office.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Does anyone know of a good travel
      agent?&nbsp; I am looking for about 1 week of fun in the sun (white sand
      blue water). </font></td>
