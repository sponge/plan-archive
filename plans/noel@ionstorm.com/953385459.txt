      <p><font face="Arial">Been a very long 7 months!&nbsp; Things have become
      quite different since I first started on this project.&nbsp; During the
      process of this project I have taken off around 1 week, and most of that
      time during the 'vacation' I was sick.&nbsp; However, heh, this weekend I
      am going home to have a nice long 2 day weekend... 2 WHOLE days!!!!!&nbsp;
      *hint* *hint*</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">So, anyway, the AI has shaped up to be fairly
      intelligent without being too much of a burden on the CPU as well as the
      player.&nbsp; There are a million little tiny details that I could get
      into regarding all of the time and energy that has gone into a good
      portion of the AI system, but I think I might leave most of that for a
      later date.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">During the project, I have been documenting the
      progress of the AI and world entities.&nbsp; If given permission, I might
      even post that document somewhere for people to take a gander at so they
      can see the progress of at least one aspect of making a game.&nbsp; After
      reading the 55 pages of documentation people will start to understand how
      MASSIVE Daikatana really is and how much work has gone into this mammoth
      game!&nbsp; If it is 'ok' to post this somewhere, then I will probably
      hold off until people have had a chance to play it so they can then relate
      to the whole process.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">As far as when the game will be done, well I am
      taking the weekend off and breaking the 7 day a week schedule, thus we
      must be VERY close to completion!!!!&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">My bones are tired... fingers are bleeding... and I
      am happy as a pig in SH!t!!!!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">So, come Monday I will probably post again to start
      an update on the progress of the game and you can count on the purtty
      little britches around your waste that I am going to post when the game is
      'officially' gold!</font></p>
