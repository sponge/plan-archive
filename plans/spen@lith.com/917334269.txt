Been a while since I had an update... Work goes well, and life does too. Going to get busier in the next month so I will be here quite a bit, enhancing the muscles in my clicking & typing hands, while running my poor carpal-tunnel wrists out of much-needed bodily fluid.

My girlfriend is out of town for 2 weeks, so that means I will be a bundle of tears. I think I will make it, but nobody will be there to fill the "mother" figure as I lay in the fetal position crying and punching my thighs.

In other news, I am just chillin' as usual at the gym, trying to gain weight. Working my abs regularly so certain people don't give me shit about the "petina" ...

Saturday was fun, very action-packed. Let's just say that a integra GS-R w/apparent full bolt-on's got SERVED, and that was within the first 15 minutes of the evening :)

Well, I am going to get back to it, luvv
