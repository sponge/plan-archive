Hey everyone :) testing out to make sure our new fingering and plan updating stuff works well.

Personal life? Well, having as much fun as possible. Work is going good, and hopefully I will hit my 200 LB bodyweight goal on Jan 1st. Hopefully I will have the best parts of Dorian and Priest at that point.

P.S. Been entranced by Brotha Lynch's music lately. Quite enjoyable and ever so laid back and melodic.
