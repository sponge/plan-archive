Captains log. A big one!

OK, all I can say again is that I boy it's been fun playing Sin DM. Ho, hum
it's late, time to go home.....wait.....anybody want to play a little DM....
OH YEAH!...Servers up...LET'S ROCK!

The tribe has been having so much fun late nights playing DM, smacking people
around, getting blown into chunky fun bits, watching my body tumble backwards 
off a ledge when Mr. Paradox pimps me from across the level. Thanks Tom. ;-)
On top of that there are just so many cool little things going on in the levels
and with the game that make it such a joy to play.

The countdown draws near and we're itchin' to release SIN upon the world.

I must say that the whole tribe and tribe friends had one hell of a blast at
the Saturday BBQ that Harry had thrown. OH MY GOD! The food, the fun, the 
water sports, the people, the whole thing, Hey Tom! get some sun! running>. On top of that the party just kept getting wilder and wilder, but 
there's nothing wrong with that. ;-)
