Well, I hope everyone read the official press release from Activision. Yes,
2015 Inc. will be doing an official add-on pack for Sin. It's a very cool
thing to have happen. The guys over there are really doing some great stuff.

The siniverse will continue on with new levels, monsters, a brand new story
and tons of fun. They have some new ideas that their trying to explore and
we all are looking forward to what they will deliver.

The tribesmen are working hard right now on finishing up Sin, giving it all 
the neato little touches that make Sin so special. The team has really pulled
together and are in sync with what we need to do to make this game rock!

I'd like to put out a big thanks to all of the people who have written us 
with compliments, comments, suggestions, and even their complaints. We look
at them all and try to make sure that we've not forgotten anything important.
It is also very cool seeing all of the new sites popping up. Get ready to Sin
until you drop. :-)
