Well the new day has dawned and what does it bring. Ah the sweet smell of
Spring. The man with a Paradox celebrated his 22nd B-day last night and
a crew upwards numbering 26 ended up cheering Tom along for his big B-day
bash. His fine lady, Killcreek, had arranged a great get together over at
Kobe Steak house and the gang from Ritual, Ion, Rogue, and a few others
which I forget were laying in wait in our own private room for the lucky
couple to arrive and for us to pounce on him with B-day cheer. Needless to
say we actually did surprise him with our sheer numbers and the festivities
began in earnest. The meal was great, the company fantastic, and the jokes
and abuse were right on target, all aimed at Tom.

A smaller crew ended the night by jumping in the limo that was rented and 
blazing over to Speed Zone for a few dozen turns around the track. It all 
turned out great (I hope) since I ended up creeping back home for some 
much needed rest that I've been missing lately. Oh No! Poor me! ;-)

The overall night was quite fun, it must have been, our Lord is not even 
in here yet so we must have partied hardy. That being said, we all wish 
that bastard a happy birthday and many more to come. Hey wait, Harry's 
B-day is Sunday.  OH NO!  Another party!  Oh Yeah!  Get the vitamins out!
