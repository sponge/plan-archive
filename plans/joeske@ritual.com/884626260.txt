Well, the new year is here. Sin is moving along at break neck pace after
we all got a much needed break for the X-mas holidaze. We are trying to
take a look at the complete picture now and see how we can make Sin a
truly unique experience (as we've been saying).   ;) The review/idea
phases that we are going through has also really helped build up some
team interaction and spirit. I've never seen everyone so focused and
concerned about what everyone else is doing and how we can make things
better.

Don "Onethumb" MacAskill is joining the tribe, as you all know, and we 
are really looking forward to getting him out here to Dallas. He is one 
of those rare people that you meet and instantly can build a rapport with 
him. I have not met anyone that can make you feel like you've known him
for years in only just a few minutes. So, everyone had better watch out
because Don is going to 

Special conrats go out to Steve "sCary" Gibson. He has moved over to VRGN
and is working on some newer more expansive stuff for them and himself.
We're going to miss ya steve, but hey, it's not like you're that far away
so we'll be seeing you around I'm sure.  ;)

Personal Side:
I'm looking at getting a DVD player and wondered what the best one to buy 
would be and realized that right now the tech is so new that it will be 
changing yet again before the year is out so why go high end when you 
don't have to. So, I'll get a low end player and wait until the next-gen
ones come out and then get the one that I'll probably end up keeping for
the next ten years.
