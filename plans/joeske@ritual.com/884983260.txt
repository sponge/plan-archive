Our top story today.........FLASH....CART GETS 5 STARS FROM CGW. Oh Yeah!

I just got word through the grapevine that the last game that I worked 
on over at Terminal Reality just got a 5 out of 5 star rating in the March 
issue of (CGW) Computer Gaming World magazine. Not only that, it was given
the "CG Choice" stamp of approval and was also named "Sports Game of the 
Year". WOW! What a great honor to receive something like this. It really 
perks you up and adds a spring into your step.

I have to take time out and thank all of the people that I worked with 
over at TRI, especially Mark Randel and Brett Combs, for treating me so
well and giving me the opportunity to work on such great projects. I can
think of no better way of finishing up a project then to receive such
grand kudos from the press. Congrats to everyone who worked so hard on
such a great product.


And now back to our remote unit.

I just started working on compiling the newest list of tasks for the Sin
team to work on. We've spent the past 8 days playing the game and testing
things out. We've compiled all of our ideas into one big list for each of 
the levels and then sit down and meet on those. We then hit the bell and
the battle begins. We all start talking and fighting for our ideas and I
get to referee the whole match. It's been some of the best and hardest 
times for us as a group. We all have strong opinions about how things 
should look and feel in the game and it takes some time to work those out.

I love it. I really do.  :)

It is the best time for new ideas and good feedback to flow from the 
group. We have our moments of grating opinions, but there is always some 
wise ass ready to crack a lame idea just to lighten the mood up. We all 
get along so well and joke way more than we should.......nah.....maybe 
we need to do more. Yeah that's it. The new idea period is finished for 
now and it is up to me to sort out all of the notes and ideas into a 
coherent task list for everyone to work from. Oh Joy! ;) 

We've got a much clearer focus now on where Sin will be going and what you
will see. I just can't wait for you all to see it. It will rock.  :)
