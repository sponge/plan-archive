all day long you begin to wax poetic.

The Beginning! A long brief history of me!

Everyone is probably wondering who I am and where did I come from to be
able to score such a cool position as Producer of Sin. Well, I started
off as a Beta tester for Apogee back some 4+ years ago. Tested a lot
of games and when they were hiring for Tech Support, I left behind
family, friends, and 9+ years as a programmer for a Telecommunications
company in Los Angeles. Great job right out of high school. :)

Anywho, I only took the job since they said that there was room for
advancement within the company. Once there I jumpad at any chance to
do any type of game design or development and lo and behold, I was
able to start doing level design for Rise of the Triad. That worked
out well, and I then jumped in on Shadow Warrior as my next project.
SW was going slow with Duke development taking precedence and I wanted
to move up to the next stage in design and development. I was not
being used to my fullest potential. So, exactly one year to the date
of starting at Apogee, I moved over to Terminal Reality Inc. TRI was
in need of a full time level designer for Terminal Velocity, which 3DR
was distributing, and it offered me the best opportunity to expand my
horizons and challenge me as a designer and developer.

TV was a wonderful madhouse rush of a game and is still one of my
most favorite titles.  I was in charge of level design for TV and
did a lot of coordination between 3DR and TRI. Fury3 sprung off of TV
and then FZone! (add-on for Fury) followed that. Lead level D and
coordinator for Fury once again became my tasks. Next, came Hellbender,
which offered me my first co-producership with the prez of TRI Mark
Randel. Quite a ride on that project with no time to come up for air.
Lead Level D, creative coordinator, co-producer and general do
everything became my tasks. I was lucky to get a breather in the middle
of HB and was able to do some level design on Monster Truck Madness,
which is a total blast to play and was fun to design for. I end my
great run at TRI with CART Precision Racing as my last title for them.

Whew! A lot work for such a short amount of time. 5+ games in a 2+
year period is quite an acomplishment (tooting my own horn). There
were other projects worked on during this time, but they have not 
seen light of day, but that kinda shit happens.

A little while ago while visiting my buds at Hipnotic/Ritual, we
talked about what was going on and where things were headed and I did
not see myself following the same path that TRI was taking. A week
later, Mark D and I went out to lunch and the offer was made to come
over to Ritual. I've never had such a tough decision to make.  Both
companies are great to work for, have great futures, and can offer so
much. I agonized over the decision for a few days straight and could
see no bad choice to make, so I decided to take the challenge offered
me by Ritual to come over and Produce/Coordinate for them. I leave
TRI now as we finsih up Precision Racing - Indy car simulation for
Microsoft (Boy I talk too much!!!!), and look forward to working with
all of my long time friends down here at Ritual. And special thanks 
to any and all who made it through this long bit of text.

Ciao!  Joe "Skeme" Selinske
