Well, time really does fly by as they say. It has new been four years to 
the day that I have now been in Texas. Four years, almost seven games put
out onto the shelves, work at three companies, and a ton of new friends. 

Yes, four years ago I took a chance that changed my life forever and I 
look back now without a single regret. I've worked at three tremendous
companies; Apogee/3D Realms, Terminal Reality, and now Ritual Entertainment.
They all taught me some important lesson in business, games, and life. I've
built a fantastic number of relationships in the local area and I really
do like living in Texas. ;) I've also worked on some cool and diverse games
which all hold special memories for me. 

Rise of the Triad, the first game that I ever worked on. Terminal Velocity, 
the first game that I really got to express myself on. I saw that game and 
had visions of "The Empire Strikes Back", as the snow speeders raced over 
the terrain just barely skimming the surface. This game allowed me to 
unleash some of the crazy thoughts racing through my head. It allowed me to 
experiment and it gave me an opportunity to expand my skills as a level 
designer and an organizer. Next came Fury3, followed by FZone!, then by 
Hellbender. These games allowed me to take the next step up, to organize
and direct the production of the games and eventually to produce. I even
got a break from Hellbender to spend time on Monster Truck Madness, getting
back into level design and the creative side of the production process.

Time and opportunity once again turned towards me again and gave me the 
chance to work again with the same group that I started with. Ritual had 
just started Sin and needed one more piece for the machine to keep working 
smoothly. I'd put in a lot of tough hours, sacrificed a lot of personal
time, but I am now working with another incredible company. A great group 
of talented people that have tremendous focus and determination to be the 
best that they can. They inspire me. They keep me in awe. They ROCK!

As Hamlet was heard saying, "Get thee to a nunnery!". I now steal this
line and update his immortal words, "Get thee to a Game Company!". It can
and will be the most exciting, thrilling, challenging, twisted, exhausting,
and cherished experience that you will ever have. If you can't do so, you
can still capture that same spirit by examining your current position, 
finding all of the good and interesting possibilities that it has to offer
and then grabbing a hold of those. So many of us in the past accept the bad
within and refuse to take a chance, to risk it all to capture something
better. I'll tell you this, that I was scared out of my head when I finally
accepted the new job, but I remembered that the worst I could do was fail.
Fail and then I would have to try again. It's not so bad once you get used
to taking a few risks. It is never easy but I guess you get used to the 
little butterflies in your stomach and you try to find new experiences that
give you that same thrill again and again.
