I'd like to send out special congrat's to all of the guys up at 2015
for Wages of Sin. This Mission Pack for Sin really turned out great
and I'm sure everyone out there is going to enjoy all of the great new
levels, cinematics, and other cool ideas that they've implemented. 
The whole crew was a pleasure to work with and I look forward to 
seeing what they create next.

Mark already mentioned the cool new DM modes (hoverbikes and 
Informer) and we all really enjoyed playing them for hours on end.

Be sure and run out a get your copy once they hit the stores.

On a side note, I just hit my 5 year mark here in Texas on the 16th 
and boy what a run it's been.
