Boy the fun never stops here at Ritual. I just came to work and was walking 
towards the building when I looked up at Harry's office. Something seemed 
out of the ordinary. Did he redecorate. Why YES, he did! Well, not him 
exactly, but the lovely Neon sign just below his office did. It decided to
blow out and start a nice little fire. 

Yep, the bar decided to have a nice little contained fire that consumed the 
awning area below our offices. I must say, that the lovely smoky smell that 
permeates the first floor bar is just wonderful. The fans are all blowing as 
they feebly attempt to push the air throughout the area. Lucky for us that it
was caught right away and that the great and speedy people of the Dallas Fire
Department were on the scene earlier in the morning to take care of it.

I wandered around the offices this morning and was graced by the lovely story 
as related to me by our own Lord himself. He even told me of the antics he 
went through as he attempted to take pictures of the whole thing with the 
digital camera. His slippng and sliding around as he wandered through the foam, 
almost falling on his arse in the process. His timing was perfect as he 
was just about snap some photos, the three fire trucks took off and began to 
wind their way back home. Harry's office today has a big chuck taken out of it 
and his desk is all over the place since they had to break through the wall to
make sure that the beast was contained. Oh Joy!

OK, enough of the fire side banter. ;-)  Hey, we've been playing some serious
DM lately and boy are we having some fun. You can't start a server without 
another seven people joining in and getting nuts on each other. The Sniper 
Rifle is the coolest weapon. Pop, you're dead. OH the headshot! That must've 
hurt. Yeah! We are all working non-stop but boy we are having some fun with 
this baby now.

Oh Wait! Do I hear another server being started. Oops. Gotta go!
