I don't think that I've mentioned this yet, but I was just looking through
the latest game magazines and the BEST OF 1997 issues just came out. Both
PC Games and Computer Gaming World gave little old us the BEST ADD-ON 
Awards for Scourge of Armagon. PC Gamer gave it to Rogue's Dissolution of 
Eternity. What can we say but, "Thank YOU!" WOW, what a great honor for
both our companies that we scored this new categories most coveted honor.

I guess this just goes to prove that when you have a great base to build 
upon, you can create wondrous things. Congrats should really go out to
the original core group that really worked hard to make Scourge a major
success. They kicked ass and now they are taking names (well, awards).
