Friday, October 30th 1998
-------------------------
The resounding beat of the drums has subsided, the dust has settled from 
all of the stomping and the fire pit embers grow cold. The tribe has 
finished weaving their latest magical spell and S.I.N. has been unleashed 
upon the world. 

We've all been through some very tough, gut wrenching, turbulent times 
during the creation of this game but as we neared the finish line we could
truly see what was forming. We've finished the game and you should all be 
seeing it very soon. Turn off the lights, crank up the stereo, grab a big
bottle of water and delve into our universe, but be warned, time has a way
of blinking out as you continue to play and explore SIN. I know I've lost 
many hours while running through the back alleys of Freeport.

I must say that this project has been one of the most challenging and 
rewarding projects that I've worked on to date and I'm in awe at how well
the whole tribe dug down deep into their souls to find the energy to keep
going until the end. Everyone here makes me proud to be a member of this 
tribe.

The tribal celebration continues and one proud, brave member is venturing out
into the wilds known as 3D Realms. Charlie Wiederhold is moving across the 
valley to one of our other local tribes and we all wish him the best of luck.
I also personally want to thank him for the incredible job that he put in and
for sticking around until the very end. His spirit and drive was nothing beyond
incredible. 

Never fret though, the fires will burn bright again as the FAKK2 team begins
their incantations. 

Thanks also go out to everyone who supported us, encouraged us, put up with 
our crazy work schedules, and put up with our fits of creative rage. The 
friends, girlfriends, wives, and familes of the tribemen never let us down
and supported us through the good and bad and they are the braces that kept 
us from falling. The ying to our yang.

Now we can relax and play some of the other great games out there, I know I've
got a stack of about 17 games I really want to play. With Christmas around the
corner I know I'll never catch up on all of the fun. Damn!  ;)
