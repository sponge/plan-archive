Well, finally recovering from a serious PAR-TY last night. The group over at 
Terminal Reality had a big MTM2 release party over at GAMEWORKS in Grapevine
and fun was had by all. The whole TRI crew, some of the gathering, some 
Ritualites, some local industry people, and friends galore. They reserved the 
whole upstairs area and had an open bar from 8 until 11. OH MY! FREE BOOZE! 
With this crowd it's a lethal combination that staggers the imagination.

Food, Fun, Drinks, Fun, Presentation Ceremony, Fun, More Drinks, Fun, Free 
Games, Fun.....and did mention that we had a lot of fun. I also met quite 
a few new people. Some serious gamers from Oklahoma, Phil and Sarge some new 
people around the industry, Rob Cohen of Edge of Reality, and I have the 
distinct pleasure of being a bonehead by shaking his hand a little too 
furiously thus spilling his drink all over the place (sorry dude!). Late 
night introductions hurt. ;-)

The Lady Jessica was another serious sight to behold. Jeff Smith, from TRI, 
and I talked a lot with this incredible woman. My, OH MY! All I can say is
that Jeff is a DAWG and proud of it. You are a D A W G, Jeff! You don't
deserve it one bit. ;-)

Played some pool and once gain proved that if you never really look at
your shots you can still make some in. I played Mr. Mike "BALD" Porter in
some long cue and wanted to see how long we could prolong the game, but 
given enough time he finally sunk them in. No one took it seriously while
just standing around jawing and relaxing, total fun. Chaos theory in action.

What better way to end out the night then to venture downstairs and play 
video games until 1:30 in the morning. Nothing like playing racing games 
while being half smashed out of your gourd. But, when you've got FREE play 
cards with a virtually unlimited amount of joy waiting at your finger tips, 
what else can you do but go nuts. Played tons of Virtua Fighter 3 (Yeah a 
little behind in the times) and am blown away by their whole game it looks 
and plays like a f'ing movie at times and I just couldn't get enough.

So, a big thanks goes out to the entire TRI crew for throwing such a great
party. It's great getting together with everyone to relax and enjoy a few 
drinks and have some serious fun.

Oh yeah!  Hi Lynn.
