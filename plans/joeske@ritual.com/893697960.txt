sequel. That is all I can say about that.

Hum....It seems that a certain Jedi Master has begun his descent into the
Dark side. Would that now make him a Sith Master instead. I feel that my
training has been somehow....tainted by his evil intentions. I must consult
with the spirits of my ancestors to see my future. Always in motion is it
and hard to see which path to take.

I've been Sinning a lot and maybe that has altered my perceptions of the 
force. I can not help it, eager and restless am I. Adventure, excitment,
the adreneline rush of the kill. Maybe I am sliding down the dark path also.
I must give up this match with death, but I can't. I WILL SMACK YOU DOWN
OH DARK ONETHUMB! I WILL! I must focus my energy towards the light and 
defeat my master. I must be one with Sin and his utter destruction will
be mine. HA, HA, HA, Ha, Ha, Ha, ha, ha!

Starcraft is one in which my defenses are down. Terrans suck, but that's 
just my opinion, since I don't know how to effectively use their forces. 
Only time and severe beatings from the thumb of one will tell if I will
continue on the path of Terrans.

Sin is my one focus in life. My muse and my burden that we all love to have.
It moves, changes, and takes shape even as I write and the magic continues
as we push forward on this journey. Oh my will you all be surprised by 
what we've got in store for you. Soon. Soon we will release more info as 
the wheels turn towards release. Keep an eye open and we'll see you soon.

Oh Onethumb, I may be beat, but the war is far from over. I will prevail. 
Prepare to meet thy doom (no not that game) and to eat your own words.
SMACK YOU DOWN!
