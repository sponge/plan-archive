JESUS.

In my classes this quarter (operating systems and programming languages)
I learned a lot about Java. It is, for the most part, pretty nice.

However I'd just like to say that JNI is absolutely disgusting and I
cant wait until I finish abstracting the entire thing into an
interface that is actually useable (not to mention readable).

I'm using it in my final project for my programming languages class.

The final project involves peaceful coexistence and presentation
(and intercommunication) of programs running in different languages
all at the same time. This project is a test/trial/experiment (running in
Java) of my grand sceheme to replace HTML and web browsers and run several
large companies out of business.

More information will be available over the summer at www.openform.org,
however none is there now since there I don't have a machine to handle it.
