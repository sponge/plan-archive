I've made some changes to the 2d Spline Tool and so you can
find a netscape compatible applet (maybe ie3.1 too?) up at the same
url (http://starbase.neosoft.com/~otaku/java);

The Sun JVM still doesnt run it correctly though.

I heard about that glDoom project losing all their source code,
even though they had several backup mechanisms -- reason #4053 why you
should release source code under the GPL.
