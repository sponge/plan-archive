I am the King of Japan. I have a message for your viewers. Well..
I'm.. just sitting here. I don't get out much.

SinView 1.2 is ready. I've decided not to release the code with it.
I'm not protecting anything - its just not in a very release-able
state. If there are enough requests for it I will get my ass in
gear and make it available.

SinView 1.2 views .swl files, .tga files, .pcx files, and .def
files (.def files are, basically, the models). It will let you
convert .tga's and .pcx's to .swl, .swl to .pcx, extract files,
take screenshots, modify texture properties, etc. Just give it
the base directory, the .pak files you want it to look through
(it also views files in the directory tree on disk), and have
a blast. Registration costs $10 and will get you.. a nice
pleasent feeling knowing that I will be able to eat one more
fast food meal.

A side note: If any companies (*cough*Valve) wouldn't mind me
writing "viewers" for their models, textures, etc, send me
some header files and some data files and maybe i'll get something
going.

Man, Sifl and Olly Rocks. Crescent Fresh.
