Merry Christmas, and Happy(and very safe) New Year!!

If you are into fooling around with engines, I suggest you download www.jet3d.com. It's open source(at least this release is), and the quality is there. Also keep your eyes open for JTest, which is a fan based creation of a sample game for the jet3d engine.
