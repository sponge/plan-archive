First off, if you do not know already, I suggest you run by DAWNOFDARKNESS.COM.

Wardsix cancelled their "was to be" commercial add on to id's Quake2. It looks like this add on is now turning into a full fledged game or possibly game series. Sounds like a cool idea. If you haven't yet, I suggest you download the demo/beta they released a few months ago for Quake2. It's enjoyable to play. I mentioned this because A) I know the guys at wardsix, and B) As many of you have.. I have been looking forward to the add on since it's early development.

Secondly, a long time mapping bud of mine, Pete Weatherby(who also happens to work @ wardsix) has finally launched his mapping site on Planetquake.com. If you love DM maps, he is the mapper for you.

Check it out @ planetquake.com/shadowdane

/me currently downloading the newest Quake3. I am not yet convinced this game is the game for me. Shortly, I will be back on a t1, so maybe my opinion will change, but for the time being, I think I will stick to the free team fortress classic.
