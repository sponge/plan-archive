At first I thought this was just a cheap attempt at getting people over to the site to click on their ads.(so please don't click on their ads if you disagree with 'em;-))

Whatever the case, the following article is a misdirected, uneducated look into violence in games. Violence in society is an extremely complex issue, and it's a shame people beat around the issue instead of dealing with the real mental illnesses at hand.

If you feel the same way I do, please blast them on their forum.


Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!
