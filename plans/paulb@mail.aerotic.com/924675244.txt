<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>It's 420.. 'nuff said</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>My second article on hype in my fortnightly
column should be up by thursday evening @ gamesplayer.com.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Now time to rant(sort of)</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>First and foremost, I want to express
my deepest sympathy for the victims and their families of today's high
school shooting tragedy. Originally, I was not going to mention this at
all, but I feel it's necessary.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>I don't buy the theory that we are
more violent now, than we have ever been. I believe we see more violence
thanks to widespread communication, but as an entire species we are not
more violent.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>That's not an excuse. If anyone out
there knows of anyone who may be a potential harm to not only themselves,
but others, please seek professional help. Actively seek a counselor(if
it's high school), family member, or something who is in a position to
help. As I posted on an abcnews message board earlier tonight, </font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>yes, some people are more violent
than others, and yes, some people have biological reasons, as well as conditional
reasons to be more violent, but we as a society must thoroughly keep an
eye out for anyone who may become violent. It's one of our jobs. I don't
think it's too much to ask.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Anything that saves a few lives is,
without a doubt, worth it.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>A large amount of gamers our there,
especially the avid gamers, are around the same age as the victims in this
tragedy. Once again, I strongly encourage all of you, if you know someone
who is a potential threat or someone who you may think for any reason,
could be a threat, to actively pursue authorities figures who can help.<br>
<br>
After all, it's better to have a thousand perfectly healthy people checked
out, and found to be OK, than one person in need of help, to be ignored.</font></font><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1></font></font>
