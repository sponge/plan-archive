While preparing for my big move to Texas I made a qteam map, qtag2, which will be 
packaged with the release of Qteam 2.0.  btw, there is a public beta available at 
http://www.gis.net/~ggriggs/qi.html.

Paradox, sCary, and I had a fun time stomping Ion on their home ground in a few 
friendly games of Quake.  Ok, well it was close actually, but we edged them out.
We'll be back sometime soon, hope they've been practicing. :)

Hey, those of you running Scourge servers out there, send your IP's and server
names to me at giggler@hipnotic.com, and we'll compile a listing of them on our
web page.  Thanks to those of you already running them!
