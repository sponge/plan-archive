The Sin demo is out and so far no one has publicly ridiculed me for my crappy 
level design, so I think I just might get out of this unscathed.  Some of my 
finer work in the bank and intro levels never made it into the demo due to 
"speed issues".  Rather than beating my fists against the wall, I thought I'd 
post a couple of screen shots showing my work in the bank and intro before it 
was subject to company-wide opinion. :-)  I know quite a few people have 
interest in what takes place here at the Ritual offices, so here is a taste 
of that from a level designer's point of view.

The first is of the Intro level, which actually went through 4 major revisions.  
This is what the Intro looked like at the end of its second revision.  In 
revisions 1 and 2, I had the helicopter path circling the bank rather than just 
strafing back and forth in front of one side of it.  R_speeds were 500-800 at 
this point, plus there was a lot of overdraw taking place.  Much was sacrificed 
in terms of atmosphere and gameplay to save a few polys.



The bank never went through such drastic revisions as the Intro, but there were 
a few key areas that lost their edge when they were simplified for better 
framerate.  This room, still recognizable in the demo due to the 4 large
pillars, went from my signature bank room, to one that I refuse to look at. :-)
