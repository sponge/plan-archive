I thought that I would take a quick a moment and describe
	where the name Prime Minister came from.  Way back
	when, we decided that each project was going to have
	its own team name.  The Heretic 2 team called itself
	"Elves in Black" (don't ask, it's a long story) and
	the Soldier of Fortune team called itself "The Ministry."

Next, we went off the deep end and came up with different names
	for ourselves.  Suddenly we had a ton of "Ministers" running
	around.  We had the Minister of Propaganda, the	Minister 
	of Glory Code, the Minister of Disinformation, and about
	a hundred other Ministers of various Ministries.

Since I am the project lead for SoF, I chose Prime Minister.

See, you CAN learn something new every day.

(Okay, it may be something stupid, but at least it is new.)
