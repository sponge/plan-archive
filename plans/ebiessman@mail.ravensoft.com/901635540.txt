Whew, it's been a while since I updated.  SoF is coming along 
	nicely, and the levels are really burning!  RJ's designer 
	script language is great, and it is really going to allow 
	you at-home designers to make some even better levels!  
	Wait until you get your hands on it!

On a side note, Heretic 2 is looking better and better everyday.  
	I am really impressed with how the team is pulling together, 
	and I can't wait to be able to sit down and play through it 
	myself.  They're doing the title justice is about the best 
	way that I can put it.  It should really rock!

Oh yeah, and you'll notice that there is a link to a place called
	THE WASTE on the bottom here... I had to try my hand at a web
	page, and this happens to be my first attempt.  If you're bored,
	take a look at it and drop me a line with what you thought of
	it.

have any questions, comments, criticisms, or ideas, drop me a line with the
