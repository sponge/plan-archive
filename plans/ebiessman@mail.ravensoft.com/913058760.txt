	If you have read any of the other .plan files out there from 
	Raven today, you probably read something about the Heretic II
	mod contest that we would like to sponsor.  All we need now is 
	a site to do it on...

	Anyway, if you are a web master and you are interested in 
	hosting this upcoming Heretic II competition, please drop
	Kenn (Khoekstra@mail.ravensoft.com) or Shifty 
	(Jzuk@mail.ravensoft.com) a line that says "SHOW ME THE MODS!"
	 as the subject line.  

	Okay, so I just made that last part up.  You can write 
	whatever the heck you feel like in the subject.

	Once all we hear from everyone who wants to try and host the
	contest, we'll choose the best one and post the details and
	the contest rules.

	Make sense?  I sure hope so.

If anyone is actual reading this, I hope that you enjoy.
If you get bored, send me some mail with the subject "Because of 
your stupid finger..."  I will get back to you, it just may take
me a little time.

just mail ebiessman@mail.ravensoft.com  

Oh, and if you're REALLY, REALLY, REALLY bored, check out my first
attempt at a webpage... The Waste

One last thing... check out the mEAT wagon.  Be afraid, be very	afraid.
