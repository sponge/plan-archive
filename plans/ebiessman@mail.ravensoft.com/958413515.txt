E3 Accolades for Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force

"Best First Person Shooter"  -Evil Avatar

"Best of Show Award for: Best PC Shooter"   -AllGames.Com

"Runner Up, Best First Person Shooter"  -Gamefan

"Star Trek fans should be well pleased when the game ships this summer." 
- Benjamin E. Sones, Computer Games Online

It was *very* good to see all of the great attention that
	EF got this year!  It's a definite morale boost and I 	
	can't wait until everyone gets their hands on the full
	version of the game!  

As a side note, this is the second year in a row that we have taken 
	home the coveted Best PC Shooter award from AllGames.Com (last
	year being Soldier of Fortune!)

Thanks to everyone for such a wonderful response!
