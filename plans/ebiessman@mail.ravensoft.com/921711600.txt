"I can't wait to get that in there so that it really
	feels natural when you are blowing someone apart."

	 In reference to the huge amount of gore in SOF

Argh.  I am sorry, but SoF has kept me really busy.
	I haven't had a lot of time to check out 
	levels. Don't worry, hopefully this week, I 
	will be able to!

Once again, please make note of the disclaimer that
	was included in this post.

Also, please include which game your level was 
	made for in big letters somewhere 
	near the top of your level description.

DISCLAIMER!
If I don't get back to you right away, it is because
	I am being flooded with resumes and levels.  
	If it seems like an extraordinary amount of
	time before I get to you, like a week or more,
	drop me another line.  I would hate to miss 
	someone due to a full mailbox.

Well, it's that time again!  We're on the lookout for a new
	design position.  

Wow, you say, could I apply for this?  The answer is a 
	resounding YES!

Here's what you need to do:
	Send me (Eric Biessman) ONE map utilizing any 3D
	engine.  This could be Quake, Quake 2, Unreal,
	Heretic 2, Hexen 2, SiN, and Half-Life.  In the 
	map, make sure that it is balanced for single player
	games.  We don't want to see any deathmatch only
	levels.  Please include a text file with a short 
	description of what the level is about and what 
	the player is expected to do.  I would also
	like to see the length of construction time and 
	what editor you used to create the map.  (It would
	be nice to see a list of editors and programs
	that you are familiar with also.)

Also, please include a short bio about yourself and your
	resume.  Please include what you like to do
	in your spare time, your hobbies, and anything
	that may make you stand out above the rest.  If
	writing is your forte, include a sample SHORT story.
	I don't really have the time to read long stories,
	so the shorter the better.

We are looking to fill this position soon, so if you want to 
	be considered, do it now.

Once again, here's the pertinent information:
	1. Send me the map- ebiessman@mail.ravensoft.com
	2. ONE SINGLE PLAYER map... I can't stress this enough.
	3. Include a bio about yourself and a resume
	4. The sooner the better.  We'd like to get this rolling.

Oh yeah, and one more thing... you would have to be willing to
	move to Madison Wi... we can't have telecommuting.  It
	just doesn't work.

Good luck to everyone, I can't wait to start looking at those maps!

If anyone is actual reading this, I hope that you enjoy.
If you get bored, send me some mail with the subject "Because of 
your stupid finger..."  I will get back to you, it just may take
me a little time.
