*** Ok, quick non-game thing:

	I am looking for a copy of Jean Shepherd's
	last book, Ferrarri in the Bedroom.  Even Amazon
	can't find it, which is dang disturbing.

	If anyone has an idea where I can find a copy,
	PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE drop me a line.  If
	you have no idea who Shepherd is and you
	like reading humor, you should check him out.

	The movie A Christmas Story is based off of
	his books.

	Ok, enough of my yakkin'...

	Very cool and informative site on SoF!

-- ALSO --

Raven Software is looking for several talented and experienced
	level designers to join our team.  

We are looking for highly motivated, creative and skilled people 
	who have experience with the Quake technology in any form 
	(Heretic 2, Half-Life, Quake 1-3, SiN).  The abillity to 
	adapt is a strong plus, and any background in code or 
	scripting will go a long way.

At this time we can only accept applications from people who live
	inside the continental United States.  The position is a 
	full time one and it requires that you move to Madison, WI.

If you think you have the drive, determination, and creativity to 
	make it as a designer, drop me a line with your resume and 
	a little bio about yourself.  We also need to see your best 
	single player level to date... this should be in one of the
	previously mentioned games.

Your first test is to see if you can follow directions.  please
	send all correspondence with the subject "Because of your
	stupid plan..."

One more thing: Do not be offended if I take a while to get back to 
	you or it seems like I am ignoring you.  You would be surprised
	how many people e-mail me when I post this... add the final
	QA of SoF into the mix and it's a living nightmare.  ;)
*************************************************************************

If anyone is actually reading this, I hope that you enjoy.
If you get bored, send me some mail with the subject "Because of 
your stupid finger..."  I will get back to you, it just may take
me a little time.

Please remember that the opinions expressed in here are my opinions alone.
