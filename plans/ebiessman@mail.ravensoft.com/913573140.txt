Whew, I just spent the last 10 hours typing my fingers to the bone. 
	What's scary is that I am not even halfway done with what 
	I am trying to do.

	I decided that the design doc for SoF did not correctly reflect
	the game that we were working on.  With that in mind, I made
	it my mission to rewrite the entire document in order to 
	get everyone on the right track.

	I never realized that it would take so long.

	Luckily, I was able to take a good hard look at everything
	and do some tweaking here and tweaking there... I think
	that it will help everyone out on the project.

	It also allowed me to review all of the cool stuff that we
	are doing with this game.  You kind of lose sight of it when 
	you are working on it day in and day out.

	Realistic weapons, over-the-top violence, tons of enemies,
	die-hard combat and action, infiltration... and that is just
	the beginning.

	Add the fact that *you* get to chose which missions to play,
	*you* decide how you want to play (stealth vs. action), 
	*you* decide if you want to be bad guy or a good guy, 
	it just makes the game better and better.  After all, don't
	you want to be the person who defines their own playing style 
	and game instead of leaving it up to us to force you to play
	a certain way?

	And this isn't even mentioning all of the new technolgy that 
	we are placing in the game.  New AI, physics, scripting language,
	model system (GHOUL)... That and a ton of other things. I think 
	that we are covering all of the bases.  Heck, you should see the 
	net game stuff that we have planned.

	Military adventure sums the game up in my opinion: heavy combat
	with immersive exploration and atmosphere.  Get your guns locked 
	and loaded, we're going in!  

And they say that making video games is easy.

Oh yeah, one more thing.  Beginning this week, I am going to start
	discussing the development of SoF in greater detail.  This
	includes new things that we are implementing, sneaking 
	some screenshots in there, and also how we go about problem 
	solving... STAY TUNED FOR ACTION!
