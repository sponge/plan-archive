I had a band when I was in college called Confused Youth.  Well, 
	it seems that someone else really liked the name.  I jokingly
	put it in the search engine of ubl.com and it came back with a
	link.  I nearly dropped out of my chair.  Only when I went
	to their site did I learn that it was a new band...

Hopefully they'll make more money than we ever did.
