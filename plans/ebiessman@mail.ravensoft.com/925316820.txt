Got this in an e-mail yesterday, some sound advice.  
	I will be posting the rest of this over the 
	next few days.  

Important Things Life Teaches You...

#2 -	Pickup in the Rain, Make sure to unselfishly help others:
	One night, at 11:30 PM, an older African American woman 
	was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying 
	to endure a lashing rain storm.  Her car had broken down 
	and she desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided  
	to flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help 
	her - generally  unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s. 
	The man took her to safety,  helped her get assistance and 
	put her into a taxi cab.  She seemed to be in a  big hurry! 
	She wrote down his address, thanked him and drove away.  
	Seven days went by and a knock came on the mans door. To 
	his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to 
	his home.  A special note was attached. 

	It read: "Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway 
	the  other night. The rain drenched not only my clothes but 
	my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able 
	to make it to my dying husbands  bedside just before he passed 
	away. God bless you for helping me and unselfishly 
	serving others."

	Sincerely,
	Mrs. Nat King Cole

#3 - tomorrow
