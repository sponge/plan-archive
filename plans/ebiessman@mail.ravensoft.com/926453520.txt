5-11-99 TUESDAY
ADDENDUM
Just to let people know:  I was scheduled to go to E3 this year 
	but due to a personal issue I will not be able to 
	make it.  Still, SoF is in great hands with these 
	guys, and it should show well.

I apologize to all of the people that I was planning on meeting,
	but this is something that is pretty important to me.  
	If you were going to hook up with me, make sure that 
	you get a hold of Rick Johnson or Kenn Hoekstra instead.  

More good stories...

The Trouble Tree
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The carpenter I hired to help me restore an old farmhouse had just
finished a rough first day on the job. A flat tire made him lose an
hour of work, his electric saw quit, and now his ancient pickup truck
refused to start. While I drove him home, he sat in stony silence.

On arriving, he invited me in to meet his family. As we walked toward
the front door, he paused briefly at a small tree, touching the tips
of the branches with both hands. When opening the door he underwent
an amazing transformation.  His tanned face was wreathed in smiles
and he hugged his two small children and gave his wife a kiss.
Afterward he walked me to the car. We  passed the tree and my
curiosity got the better of me. I asked him about what I had seen
him do earlier.

"Oh, that's my trouble tree," he replied. "I know I can't help having 
troubles on the job, but one thing's for sure, troubles don't belong
in the house with my wife and the children. So I just hang them on the
tree every night when I come home. Then in the morning I pick them up
again."

He paused. "Funny thing is," he smiled, "When I come out in the
morning to pick 'em up, there ain't nearly as many as I remember 
hanging up the night before."

...this is definitely something that we all should think about
	when we go home from work or school!
