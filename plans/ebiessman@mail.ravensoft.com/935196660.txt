A big hand to Jim, the Optimist Club President, the man who single-

Your nation's long distance providers thank you.

Submission Guidelines for yet-to-be-named webzine :

Writing :

We want short stories in the horror/fantasy/sci-fi vein.  Size 
doesnÂ’t matter (at least in this case) so make the story 
whatever length it needs to be.  Other than that we have no real 
criteria - just make it good.

Send us your story via email in some format that can be read by 
Word 97.  So Word, Works, Word Perfect, or flat ascii would be fine.


Art :

Send us a scanned image (in jpg format) of your horror/fantasy/sci-fi 
artwork and you could be a featured artist or have your work shown 
with several other artists.


Details :

Send horror works to Eric Biessman
Send fantasy works to Kenn Hoekstra
Send sci-fi works to Robert Love
