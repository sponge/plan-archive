*** Make sure to read the end of this finger also! ***
Hey all, I just want everyone to know that if you mail me and I don't
	get back to you, it isn't because I am being a jerk, it is 
	because there are a lot of things going on around here and I
	have a lot of work to do.  So please, don't think that I am
	being rude.  I've just got some major stuff to do.

Four hours.  This is the maximum amount of sleep per night that I have 
	had for the last two weeks.  Yes, I am tired and crabby, but at 
	the same time I am getting excited about getting the game out 
	of the door.

We have all been playing the game non-stop, and things are looking really
	good.  Rick and Mike are cleaning up bugs left and right and 
	Brian, Tom, and I are cranking on making the levels faster and I 
	am going to have to make a major overhaul of a couple of levels
	today.

Wish me luck!

Song of the Development Period? "Bus to Beelzebub" by Soul Coughing 
	(What a classicly weird group.  Give 'em a listen... you may
	be surprised!)

Wow, the response has been great!  I have been replying to people left
	and right and everyone seems to be enjoying the demo.  Very cool.

Now, all we need to do is get the full version complete and shipped.  
	Please wish us luck!

Yee haw!

The demo is out.  Download it, play it, tell me what you think.  Please 
	send any bugs to h2bugs@mail.ravensoft.com

Hope you like it.

Also, if there is anyone out there reading this, I hope you enjoy.  If you
have any questions, comments, criticisms, or ideas, drop me a line with the
subject "Because of your stupid finger..."

And I am always looking for a good band name...

Oh yeah, one other thing...
        PLAY DEADLANDS: THE ROLEPLAYING GAME... It is the greatest thing
        since sliced bread.  It is a great world setting made up by some
        incredibly talented people.  I really can't express the amount of
        esteem I hold for the people at Pinnacle.  If you don't believe me
        about how cool it is, go to the Pinnacle home page and check it out
        yourself: http://www.peginc.com

        You will be blown away!
