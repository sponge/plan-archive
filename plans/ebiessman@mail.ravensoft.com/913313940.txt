Just picked up the latest Deadlands: Hell on Earth sourcebook, "The 
	Wasted West," and got one hell of a surprise.  I was reading 
	a little of the background story and found out that the last 
	Northern President (in the game) is none other that the 
	industry's beloved John Romero!  Of course, I don't know if
	this is based off of the Romero that we all know or if it
	was just a random name... you never know.

You should definitely check out this game and see how the future unwinds!
	See the link below for a little more information.
