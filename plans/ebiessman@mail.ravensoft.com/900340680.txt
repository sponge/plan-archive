Came in this weekend and started busting out a new deathmatch level 
	for SoF.  It's cool to be able to work on deathmatch levels 
	this early in the game, and deathmatch should definitely be 
	a new experience in SoF.  We're going to take the time and 
	add in some new and exciting things for your network enjoyment.  
	We're still in the planning stages, but what we have been 
	talking about looks pretty good and easy to do.  Thankfully. 

Disturbing thought of the Day: My wedding is in less than five months 
	and I still have a ton of stuff that needs to be done for it.

Oh yeah, and you'll notice that there is a link to a place called
	THE WASTE on the bottom here... I had to try my hand at a web
	page, and this happens to be my first attempt.  If you're bored,
	take a look at it and drop me a line with what you thought of
	it.

Also, if there is anyone out there reading this, I hope you enjoy.  If you
have any questions, comments, criticisms, or ideas, drop me a line with the
subject "Because of your stupid finger..."
