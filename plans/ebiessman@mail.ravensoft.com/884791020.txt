Hey all...

	THIS JUST IN!!!!

	We have been so happy with the results of using the net to
	find good employees that we have decided to also try to 
	use it to find a new programmer!

	Here's what we are looking for:
	1. A programmer who has prior experience in the gaming industry.
				-or-
	2. Someone who has a background in programming,	and codes games
		for fun since they see the industry as unattainable.  
		(We can make it attainable.) ;)
				-or-
	3. Someone who has taken the time to make some cool TC's and mods
		for the Quake technology, especially Quake II.

	This is a full time position, and you have to be old enough to 
	work a full time job.  Also, we don't want telecommuting,
	so you would also have to move to Madison, WI, the land of beer,
	milk, and cheese.  We are also looking to hire someone soon, 
	so please get your resumes and mail in now!
 
	What exactly do you need to send us?

	Well, what we would really like to see is a short resume/bio
	and either some sample code or a little game that you made
	or an awesome Quake mod that you developed.

	Oh yeah, where should I send my stuff?

	Well, if you want to be a programmer, don't send your stuff to
	me.  If you do want to apply here, send it to Mike Crowns,
	our director of product development.  His e-mail is 
	mcrowns@mail.ravensoft.com

	Good luck!
 
	AND REMEMBER:

	It's been a while since I posted, so
