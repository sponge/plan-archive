SoF news:
As you might have seen on some pages like Frag Fortune and the like,
	SoF is undergoing a little bit of a facelift.  

We decided that the game needed a little bit more in order to satisfy
	the needs of the gaming public.  INSERT SQUAD TACTICS HERE
	PLUS OTHER COOL STUFF.

Don't you hate when people put out teaser information?  I guess
	that you will just have to stay tuned!

What does this mean for you?  In essence, only a better game.  But, if
	you are waiting for an e-mail response from me, then you may
	have to wait a little while longer... this facelift is taking
	up all of my day, plus some of my night, too.

Jake: Have I ever told you that you are my hero?  Geez, a raging case 
	of tonsilitis and you are still here to get that Expansion Pack 
	out.

You da man!
