HAPPY B-DAY TO TOM ODELL




#6 - Ive Two Choices
	Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. 
	He was always in a good mood and always had 
	something positive to say. When someone would 
	ask him how he was doing, he would reply, 
	"If I were any better, I would be twins!"  He 
	was a unique manager because he had several 
	waiters who had followed him around from restaurant 
	to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed
	Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural 
	motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry 
	was there telling the employee how to look on the 
	positive side of the situation. Seeing this style really 
	made me curious, so one day I went up to Jerry and 
	asked him, "I dont get it!  You cant be a positive 
	person all of the time. How do you do it?" Jerry 
	replied, "Each morning I wake up and say to myself, 
	Jerry, you have two choices today. You can choose to 
	be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood."
	I choose to be in a good mood. Each time something bad 
	happens, I can choose to be a victim or I can choose 
	to learn from it. I choose to learn from it.  Every 
	time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to 
	accept their complaining or I can point out the positive 
	side of life. I choose the positive side of life."  
	"Yeah, right, its not that easy," I protested. "Yes it is," 
	Jerry said.  "Life is all about choices. When you cut 
	away all the junk, every situation is a choice. You 
	choose how you react to situations. You choose how 
	people will affect your mood. You choose to be in a good 
	mood or bad mood.  The bottom line: Its your choice how 
	you live life."  

	I reflected on what Jerry said. Soon thereafter, I left 
	the restaurant industry to start my own business. We lost 
	touch, but often thought about
