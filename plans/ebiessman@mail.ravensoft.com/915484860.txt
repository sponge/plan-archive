A new year and a few beers.

Well, maybe not.

SoF is definitely on the rise.  Weapons are in and working,
	levels are looking wondeful, and the art, sound, design,
	and programming is coming along great.

I was running through the levels, and found myself constantly
	awed by what I saw.  I haven't seen a game that looks this
	real and good in a long time. It's great.

One thing that I have found lately is that gore is good.  Shooting 
	someone with a shotgun and watching them get blown in half is 
	definitely something to behold.  It's also scary to see 
	someone lose a limb... 

	...or the top of their head.

It's damn frightening, really.

But a hell of a lot of fun, at that!
