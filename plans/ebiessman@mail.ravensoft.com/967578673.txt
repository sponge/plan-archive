A game developer dies and goes to the pearly gates.  St. Peter says "You
were a good developer all your life, so you get to choose where you want
to go.  Heaven or Hell?"

The developer thinks this is a little weird and asks to see Hell first.

St. Peter takes the developer to Hell, where they find millions of
developers chained to their computers getting whipped by demons. 
"Gosh," says the developer "this looks just like real life.  What does
heaven look like?"

St. Peter takes the developer to Heaven, where they find millions of
developers chained to their computers getting whipped by demons.  "Hold
it," says the developer "this looks just like Hell!"

"That's right," says St. Peter "but in Heaven your games get published"
