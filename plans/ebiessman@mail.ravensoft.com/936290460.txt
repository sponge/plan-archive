Check out the latest issue of PC Gamer and see what they
have to say about Soldier of Fortune!!!  Very cool,
and we are very excited to already be getting this kind of
buzz.  Wait until they see the post Alpha version of the
game!

Submission Guidelines for yet-to-be-named webzine :

Writing :

We want short stories in the horror/fantasy/sci-fi vein.  Size 
doesnt matter (at least in this case) so make the story 
whatever length it needs to be.  Other than that we have no real 
criteria - just make it good.

Send us your story via email in some format that can be read by 
Word 97.  So Word, Works, Word Perfect, or flat ascii would be fine.


Art :

Send us a scanned image (in jpg format) of your horror/fantasy/sci-fi 
artwork and you could be a featured artist or have your work shown 
with several other artists.


Details :

Send horror works to Eric Biessman
Send fantasy works to Kenn Hoekstra
Send sci-fi works to Robert Love

Response time may be a little slow but we will get back to you as 
quick as possible on whether your work has been accepted or not. 

Rights to accepted works will be retained by the artist.

Oh, and about money; we dont make any doing this so neither 
will you - sorry.    

*************************************************************************

If anyone is actually reading this, I hope that you enjoy.
If you get bored, send me some mail with the subject "Because of 
your stupid finger..."  I will get back to you, it just may take
me a little time.

Please remember that the opinions expressed in here are my opinions alone.
