Ya know, in my spare time I really had enjoyed playing Unreal Tournament online at night until the recent three months where I've played very little. When I finally started playing again (just recently) - I never realized how many morons there really are out there playing just to ruin others fun.

Take for example, there's this so-called UT clan called 187 - they're probably the biggest group of self-absorbed, arrogant bundle of kids you'll ever meet. And we shouldn't discuss their tactics either. Apparently they feel the need to consistently break gameplay on several maps that run on the server's normal rotation. (This whole gameplay breakage on regular maps is occurring more frequently in the UT community - and it's very frustrating)

Guys like this just manage to hop on to a server, hoard on one team and generally just end up ruining the fun for everyone. And then they make sure and show their obviously high intelligence level via poor insults and other types of grade school type verbiage.

I feel sorry for anyone that ends up having to match with them - if you feel cheated there's a good reason for it. :)
