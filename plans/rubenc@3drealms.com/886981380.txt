man, i wouldn't worry about a single dream like that.  It could have been merely a creative impulse.  I beleive that a dream is merely an answer to a question that we haven't
yet figured out how ot ask.  it could also be purely nothing.  I don't think that the grim reaper is coming to get you, i would think that if you get a lot of scary dreams like
that.  
 
don't spend a lot of time thinking about this unless it happens again.  its probably nothing.  mail me back and tell me what you think of it.

Hello:

All your dream means is that you've got one heck of a cool/dark
imagination.  Either that, or you just saw your death in the future and
defeated it, temporarily anyways.  Mouwahaha!  No, I think it's just a
creative imagination :)

Hello Ruben,

                    Your dream is very interesting.  From the fact that
you stated that you were at your parents place indicates that this is a
place you felt secure with in your earlier days.  Therefore it was a
HUGE surprise for you to find an evil force working against you at this
home.  The fact that you ran to get your mom and Trusted her to believe
you or assist you means that she plays a very important part in your
life, maybe as a teacher or maybe she raised you as a single parent.
Either way she plays a strong role in your life and a very trusting one
( i.e. you were possibly naked in front of her and didn't think twice
about it verifies this ).  The shower signifies a time when you are most
trusting and symbolically washing away past sins or filth.  The towel
being symbolic of the final step in the showering process could mean
that someone / or something from your past is haunting you and you could
not escape it even with a cleansing of your spirit.  More importantly,
The physical hands means that someone (human) thinks that you are
responsible for something they are upset at you for.  The fact you were
able to fight it back defines or reconfirms this is a human force.
Possibly one who practices Santeria.  And the mirror would signify, that
the true identity is once again hard to tell but that the end result
could lead to a minor tragedy to you ( you didn't say that it attacked
your mom, but that it merely pushed both of you) so your mom could be
incidentally pushed a little in order to get to you.

This is a symbolism definition...........   another way would be to
define it according to metaphysical and demonologist terms.

In spiritual terms,   you may be being reached by a demonic messenger
who has an evil nature instintively.   This would occur by opening any
of the obvious doorways... like a Ouija board, or some other
invitation.  The Devil is a master of dreams and can exploit your fears
thru them,  unfortunately, parts of the dream are cliche (mirror, hooded
figure, etc) so some of this may be a mental regurgitation of thoughts
or impressions that have been made in your mind by books and movies
you've seen and read.  A lot of people who use inhalers can be apt to
have vivid and crazy dreams.  This goes way back to the study of
demonology, which clearly states that any drug use (inhalers have a
strong proppellant) makes a person more susceptible to transmissions or
influences by the demonic world.  This is due to a lack of protection by
God during an altered state.  God will only protect when one a person of
reason willingly allows him to.


            Well hope this sheds some light on your dream......

About your dream the other night.  Did you happened to eat chocolate,
chocolate ice cream, or anything with milk in it before you went to bed?
Im not quit sure bout the milk part, but the chocolate part is a definite,
epically Rocky Road ice cream.  Yea i know it sounds weird, but it
defiantly gives people weird dreams.  Food does that to people.  My mom
gets headaches every night if she eats cheerios before she goes to sleep
(im thinking its more of the milk though).  Last time i ate rocky road ice
cream I was stuck in a dream.  Like i would wake up in my dream, roll over,
see something, get up, go do something, then wake up in my dream all over
again and follow the same pattern like a loop.  The weird thing was, when i
woke up for reals, I did exactly what i had done in my dream with out
thinking about it.  And the time I ate chocolate ice cream before that I
had a quake dream :)  Everyone I know who has ate chocolate before going to
bed has had some kind of dreamed, most the time whacked out ones.  And with
me, its always weird because I never dream (that i remember) unless I eat
chocolate.  Let me know if you did eat anything before you slept.  Hope my
rambling made some since, im tired...

Have you seen the movie "Phantasm"? It had "bad things" that come from
inside/behind the mirror. That's about all I remember from it.

This reminds me about a dream a buddy of mine had when he was younger...
It was a *series* in his dreams which started, and a murderer which
returned many nights in a row... he called him "murderer "blue"", because
that dude was blue all over... He also stood in the shower, when murderer
blue appeared, doing the most horrible things I've ever heard..

So, I'll make it short....

Prepare yourself !!  You'll get the answer in hmmm.. episode 6 perhaps..
you'll be haunted by this manymany more nights !!

Hi,

I read your .plan, and couldn't help but respond.  Because every person is
different, the meaning of every image in a dream is different from person
to person (although we share some common archetypal imagery as a culture).
The absolute best thing I can recommend is to read Carl G. Jung's "Man and
His Symbols."  It is a brilliant book that explains archetypal dream
interpretation, written by the founder of archetypal interpretation.  Even
if you don't agree with it, it's a facinating read none the less.
Hope this helps some.

The only significant thing that I have ever heard anyone say about
dreams--and this is not "true" or "false", it's just a theory, I
think--is that when you are dreaming, YOU are ALL of the actors in the
dream.  In your case, you would have been you, your mom, the
towel-think, even the shower, the towel, and the mirror.  This gives a
lot more room for introspection, and it certainly narrows down the
source of influences (which is to say, it rules out EXTERNAL influences
in the dream, not in your life), but sometimes gives some disquieting
insights about one's self.

I am a firm believer in the power of dreams, and spend alot of time and
resources exploring and trying to analyze them.

In my experience there are many types of dreams, from the simple 'anxiety'
dreams all the way up to lucid experiences.

I'm 26 now, and I have had recurring 'dream' approximately every 2 years
since I was 14.

It's not a dream exactly, what happens is that as I am going to sleep, in
that 'transition' stage, I feel myself violently and suddenly pulled into
another state. The thing is, I feel the pull CONSCIOUSLY, and remain awake
and well aware of what is happening. I find myself standing by a park bench
in the middle of a forest, surrounded by HUGE pine trees. It is dark and
the wind is blowing so furiously that the trees are almost being uprooted.
The really horrible part is that I feel an INTENSE evil vibe. Nothing at
all like a nightmare. I find myself 'locked' I cannot move nor take a
break, and remain aware of myself both in bed and in 'the forest'. With all
my might I try to break away, and when I do, I bolt upright in bed with
full awareness of everything that happened.

Anyway, what I was wondering was the 'vibe' of your dream. Was it
'dreamlike', or did it have another quality ? The intense feeling of evil
was was drew me to respond to your .plan file. I am of the opinion that
dreams of this nature need no interpreting, and may very well be some scale
of possesion.

If you are of a 'sensitive' nature, and do not discount the possibility of
wandering spirits, you may find that you were actually being harrased by a
malign entity. Believe me, it happens. In this case I would venture that
your dream was just that, and brooks no clever interpretation.

The fact that you were able to punch the mirror is a good sign, and was the
break you needed.

Another possibilty is that you may be 'maturing'. In that I mean that you
may be at a changing point in your life, perhaps you are trying to cull a
bad habit or behavior. The fact that you were in the shower may suggest you
are trying 'clean' yourself. The vibe you felt and the blocking motion of
the towel may represent internal resistance to that change. The fact that
you saw the 'hood' in the mirror may further confirm this.

There is a school of philosophy, from the teachings of Gurdjeff and
Ouspensky that suggest that we are NOT a single entity, and that inside us
are a number of distinct personalities that all fight for power. How else
can the SAME person feel LOVE AND HATE ? If we proceed under Gurdjeff's
assumtions, we may consider the possiblity that the resistance you felt,
and the demon in the mirror are a particular 'dark' side of your persona
that you are activley fighting against, and which is activley fighting
against you.

enough talk, I'm going back to work ;)

original dream I had - 

My dream last night was messed up.  I was back home in Miami at my parents house taking a shower.  As I was taking a shower I felt that there was another presence in there with me.  It gave me the shivers and for some reason I knew it was evil.  I got the out of there quick.  I ran just to the end of the hallway leading to my bedroom then I stop to think about what happened.  Something brought me back to the shower and for some strange reason I wanted to finish my shower.  Now that I look in retrospect I don't even remember if I took my clothes off or not.  I proceeded to shower again and the same thing happened. I ran out, this time I was in combat mode ready for anything.  I proceeded with my shower and as I was looking towards the towel rack, one of the towels started to animate and move.  It came at me, and I ran out of the bathroom yet again.  I had to get someone to go with me to the bathroom.  I found my mom in the kitchen and she went with me.  I don't even remember telling her what I saw, she just went with me.  I walked in the bathroom and stood next to the sink, my mom right behind me.  I waited and nothing happened, then just when I was getting ready to leave, the towel emerged and started coming at me.  This time blocking my path from exiting the bathroom.  I struggled with the towel.  As I gripped the towel it felt like I was interlocking with someone's hands. I could feel hands.  The towel overpowered me started to push me and my mom backwards up against the wall.  In the struggle I adjusted my grip on the towel and I started pushing it backwards.  I remember telling my mom to feel the towel so she could affirm that it felt like a pair of hands and not a towel. Well, I pushed the towel as far back as I could.  There was a mirror at the end of where I was pushing the towel and I pushed it until the towel was inside the mirror.  By doing that I got a glimpse of the entity in the mirror looking at me.  It was wearing a black hood and all I saw was an evil grin and glowing red eyes.  I then punched the mirror and I woke up.

TIPS

Setting up 3D Studio Release 4 to run under Microsoft Windows 3.xx or 95 in just two easy steps

Step 1: Add an entry to your system.ini file

You have to add an entry in your SYSTEM.INI file.  Its located in the root directory of windows. Ex. C:\windows  If you can't find it hit the start button and go to Find / Files or Folders and do a search for it. When this is done, add an entry in the [386enh] section: 

device=c:\3ds4\pharlap.386

If you have 3ds4 installed to another drive then make sure the path is correct.  The pharlap.386 file can be found in your 3ds4 directory.  If you can't find the file then do a search for it, and make sure the path is correct leading to this file.



Step 2: Create an icon for it

To create an icon simply go to your 3ds4 directory, using windows explorer find the file 3ds.exe.  Click on the file highlighting it then right mouse click.  It should bring up a menu selection, then just go to create shortcut.  Then just drag the file named short cut to 3ds4 to your desktop.  

If you want the official 3ds4 icon instead of the default MS-DOS icon then follow these steps.
1. click the 3ds4 icon on your desktop.
2. Right mouse click, should get a menu, go to properties
3. Hit the program tab on top.
4. Click on the change icon button
5. Click the browse button and go to your 3ds4 directory, there you should find a file called 3ds.ico
Hit apply and your done.

FACTS
 
Japanese researchers found that 37% of software faults would have been avoided "by appropriate scheduling and placing no stress on the developers." Another 34% of those faults were attributed by the researchers to "human nature" rather than to technical difficulties. Adding these percentages together, the researchers conclude "71% of all faults are the responsibility of the project manager, the quality assurance manager, and the senior management" (in the sense that these faults arise from human-factors considerations).
