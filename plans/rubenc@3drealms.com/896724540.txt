Ok you read my last plan file and you either agree or disagree.  Well from your e-mails it seems like its 50/50.  So here is my blanket statement for all of you peopleÂ…. HUMANS who don't agree

RELAX!  Was it premature to say what I said? ..... yes ....... time will tell    ...... look I just got back from E3, we did really well and I decided for the first time ever to tute my own horn.  I like where I work, is that so bad?  Are you perfect?  Is it possible to make a wrong statement?   The world revolves around false and true statements.  You have a right to say and think what ever you want, you could even use bad language "in some cases".  Its ok man,  I love freedom of speech.  And yes,  I could be wrong.  And no, that wasn't professional conduct.  I must be disciplined!   Look I have total respect for everyone that had a game to show at E3.  I hope the fans buy all those game so we could continue to make them.  What I really want to say about Sin and Diakatana and all developers is that there are extremely talented people on every team who I guarantee cares so much about there product that they work hard till there fingers come off. I respect that above all!  I know I will play and enjoy all those games regardless of what anyone says.  First person game rule!  Oh oh,  is that offending anyone?  

Hi, I am Ruben.  I am Human.  I can make mistakes.  I live in a free country where we  have freedom of speech.  I love America! I love America! I love America! I love America! I love America! I love America!
