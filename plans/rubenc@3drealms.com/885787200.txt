Hello out there...

I am new to all this fingering stuff solet me introduce myself...

My name is Ruben. I'm an artist working on the Duke Nukem Forever Team 
at 3DRealms.  I mainly do textures and models.  Some of my  past 
projects include Corridor 7, WitchHaven 2 and Tekwar.  I love 
first person games.  If you liked Duke Nukem 3D, you guys are 
in for a treat!  Duke Nukem Forever is looking mighty awesome.

Helpful Tip For The Day
Are there still some of you out there that still using 3d studio 
release 4?  I mainly use it to model and create sky boxes in the 
game.  Are you having performance problems at startup and/or when 
switching modules on a Pentium 200 or Cyrix 6X86?  There is a patch 
for this problem by Autodesk:    Download it at:
ftp://ftp.medialabs.es/pub/kinetix/fstcpufx.exe
It seems that 3D studio has problems with some fast CPU's.

Cool Duke Nukem Merchandize

One of the really cool things about being an employee at 3D realms is 
that you get free stuff.  I recently was pleasantly surprised.  I am 
talking about the Limited edition Hand painted 7
