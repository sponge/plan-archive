Klingon Oath Of Empire

Beneath the stars that drip with blood I stand, defiant and alone, I am here, my Emperor.

Call on me, I beg of thee. I was nothing before this day and nothing shall remain if I cannot serve thee now.

Pain and suffering are my just rewards. Do with me as serves thee best. It matters not that I serve, only that which I Defend.

Forfeit of life, but not honor, in thy cause, death at the last is welcome. I am here, my Emperor, ready at last to be an
instrument of thy will.

Ready and to obey and die.





DO any of you out there like Klingon's?
DO any of you think Unreal is going to rock?
Well how about both!

MicroProse, Inc. is currently developing a first person Klingon shooter using the Unreal Engine.  Les Bird is the lead programmer and one of my friends on the project.  If his name doesn't ring a bell, he programmed Corridor 7.  I have had the honor of working with him so I know the game is going to rock.  I have also seen bits and pieces of the game, all I can say about it is if you're a StarTrek fan your not going to be disappointed.  

Here is a press release about game play and storyline

Game Play
STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION
Klingon Honor Guard will plunge players into edge-of-their-seat real-time action as they embark on a quest to save the Klingon Empire and the life of its leader, Gowron. Featuring seven unique 3-D worlds and more than 15 unique, fully interactive levels including space stations, starships and alien cities, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION Klingon Honor Guard offers an extremely rich combat environment. The player can blast his opponents with disruptor fire or cut them down with vicious bat'leth strikes. The game includes nine powerful weapons, five of which are new weapons created especially for the game.
STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION Klingon Honor Guard will provide players with
two modes of play: a plot-driven campaign and multiplayer action. Both modes feature high energy combat as their focal point and utilize the same user
interface, levels and gameplay elements. The multiplayer game supports modem, LAN and Internet play.

Game Storyline
The action begins with the player engaged in advanced training supervised by Kurn, son of Mogh, brother of Worf. The final training mission is suspended when assassins attack the high council. The player receives the briefing for their first real mission from Korek, who is supervising the operation to capture the perpetrators of the attack. This briefing details the player's objectives and sets the storyline in motion. The player's mission is to win the game by successfully battling his way to the final level and finding out who is responsible for the assassination attempt.

PERSONAL

I am searching for a utility that will convert quake2 map files into 3ds or DXF format.  If any of you know of such a utility please e-mail it to me or let me know where I can get it.  There will be a reward! 

This should not be mistaken with the 3ds2map utility already out there.  I want map to 3ds :)
