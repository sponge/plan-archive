What if you were living in a country that didn't allow free speech?
How could you run a web site that didn't support the views of your
government without getting caught and thrown in jail?  This is the
problem I have been wondering about lately.  Specifically, how can you
make a network that can send and receive information that is totally
untraceable?  For the purposes of this discussion I'll call "the
government" as the "the bad guys" or TBG, though it may very well be
that the people using this system are actually the bad guys.
Specifically this method could be using to create untraceable warez
sites, or allow terrorist to communicate in an untraceable fashion.
 
Untracable is not the same thing as encrypted.  When you send someone
encrypted email, TBG can't read it but they can determine where it is
going and where it came from.  For untraceable email there already
exist a system called anonymous remailers which send your mail to a
chain of "remailer" machines which finally deliver it to the
destination machine.  This makes it very difficult to trace the mail
to the computer it came from because the government must be tapping
each of the computer's communication to put it all together.  In most
cases the computers are located in different countries, thwarting the
ability of any one government to do this.  Further the time delay
makes it hard to correlate the time of receipt with output traffi
