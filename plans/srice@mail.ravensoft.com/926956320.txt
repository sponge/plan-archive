We on the SoF team are very excited by E3's response to the game.  It has been nearly a year that we've been busting our butts on the
project, so the positive reaction feels great.  I'd like to thank some people in the art dept. for their contribution to the demo:  senior 
animator Eric Turman for his technical innovations and animation skills that made the quality and quantity of anims possible, Jarrod 
Showers for his huge contribution to the enemy animations and his brilliant animation of the weapons, Joe Koberstein for his 
understanding of the GHOUL rendering system and fantastic gore effects, Gina Garren and Kevin Long for their unmatched texture and
skin painting, Bobby Duncanson for his destroyable object models, and everyone else who contributed to Soldier of Fortune's success
at E3.  I'd also like to thank all the programmers and designers on the project who have been the best teammates I've ever worked
 with on a game.
