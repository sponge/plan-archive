Hey everyone.  I've been out of the finger loop awhile, but I'm back.  
We're all super excited about the project we're working on (hopefully 
it'll be announced soon).  Anyway, I'm the lead artist on the project 
and I can say we have some fabulous artists working on it.  This one's 
gonna be pretty.

In fact, everyone working on the team is great.  We work well together 
which is key.  Nathan and Steve with their glory code rock.  Eric, Kenn, 
and Bobby work great with the artists throwing them tiles.  This next
year's gonna be a blast!

Just wanted to tip my hat to Phoebus at Activision who is working hard, 
mostly after hours, on our new Raven Website.  I took the pictures and
he's putting the whole thing together.  Thanks, man!  We're looking 
forward to seeing what you've come up with!!!

Soldier of Fortune it is!  

We're having a lot of fun with this game.  Its present day setting is 
allowing the art department to create a sense of authenticity and realism 
we have not yet had the opportunity to do.  It is quite a challenge that 
has been going very well so far.  We've been doing a lot of research on 
various locations around the world.  We've also done heavy research on 
weapons.  The goal is to make the player feel like they are in a real life
warzone.  So far, it's working beautifully.
