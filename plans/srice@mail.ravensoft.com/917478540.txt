I haven't written in ages, but I have to voice my excitement for SOLDIER OF FORTUNE!!!  It has been a 
pleasure working with the fine people on this project, especially Eric Biessman and Rick Johnson.  As 
far as the game goes, all I can say is I felt quite exhilerated when I zoomed in with my sniper rifle, 
pulled the trigger, and watched that skinhead fall in a disturbingly realistic manner yesterday (thanks
to the fully tweakable motion capture innovations of lead animator Eric Turman).  I firmly believe this
game will shock all of you at first.  Thrill will come later.
