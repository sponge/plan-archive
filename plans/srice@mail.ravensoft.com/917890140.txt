I haven't written in ages, but I have to voice my excitement for SOLDIER OF FORTUNE!!!  It has been a 
pleasure working with the fine people on this project, especially Eric Biessman and Rick Johnson.  As 
far as the game goes, all I can say is I felt quite exhilerated when I zoomed in with my sniper rifle, 
pulled the trigger, and watched that skinhead fall in a disturbingly realistic manner yesterday (thanks
to the fully tweakable motion capture innovations of lead animator Eric Turman).  I firmly believe this
game will shock all of you at first.  Thrill will come later.

Hello everyone.  I'd like to start giving a Soldier of Fortune art update every week or so.  We are doing
some revolutionary things on this project.  New technology combined with the ambition of our staff has
allowed for some really fantastic features in this game.  Today I want to focus on one of the most important
but often over-looked elements of game art:  textures.  Since just last year, photoshop has allowed us
to crank through hundreds upon hundreds of textures in just a few months.  The program in combination 
with the superb and fast work of 2D artists like Kevin Long, Gina Garren, and Joe Koberstein (who 
brought his photoshop expertise to Raven) gives us the variety of level location we have always thirsted
for.  That in combination with better cards and more texture memory makes for more realistic, varied and
weathered environments.  Already we have texture sets for 6 international military hot beds.  Within 
each texture "wad" we average about 450 tiles.  That means we have already created nearly 3,000 textures
for the game!  That volume far surpasses any game I've ever worked on.
