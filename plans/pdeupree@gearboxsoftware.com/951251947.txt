^?
A while back we talked about releasing a Linux dedicated server version^?
of Half Life: Opposing Force.  I wanted to post an update on how that's^?
going.  We've had the "port" done for quite a while now and it's been^?
tested and works just great.  The only problem is that, since we're a^?
commercial add-on, we need to put WON net support into the Linux^?
dedicated server.  This is turning out to be a harder to deal with^?
issue than I originally anticipated.  Some changes to the WON libraries^?
since we released Opposing Force, plus the basic differences between the^?
Windows and Linux versions have been delaying the Linux dedicated server.^?
^?
I'm still working on the Linux version when I can and I would like to get^?
it released ASAP, but unfortunately I have to resolve these WON issues^?
before I can get any farther.^?
^?
On the brighter side of things, it looks like Sierra has dropped the price^?
of Opposing Force.  The product description on their web page store has it^?
listed at $29.95, and the current weekend ad flyer for Best Buy has it^?
listed for $24.99.^?
^?
On a non-game related topic, a few things recently have gotten me thinking^?
about greed, money, and attention.^?
^?
The first thing that started me thinking about all of this is an article I^?
saw discussing the fact that big name stars payment per film is going through^?
the roof (the most recent example being Mel Gibson's $25 million for doing^?
"Patriot").  In and of itself, these guys getting paid a lot doesn't bug me.^?
However, the article I read mentioned the fact that a side effect of these^?
rising "costs" is that the other people working on these films are getting^?
paid less now (I think I read as much as 1/3 less).  Now this kinda bugs me.^?
^?
Here are stars that already should have ton's of money.  I mean, just^?
having $1 million in a decent money market fund would set me up for life.^?
On the other hand, here is a guy who is a key grip, of a writing assistant,^?
that is now making less money than the guy doing his job, say, 3 or so^?
years ago so that someone else can make more money than they can possibly^?
spend.  I'm not saying these star's didn't pay their dues and work hard to^?
get to where they are, but it just seems that there's a point at which^?
you don't need "raises" any more (even with a few ex-wives like some of^?
them have).^?
^?
Another thing that got me thinking is this "Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire"^?
thing that was on TV recently.  I'm no prude, but in all honesty this program^?
disturbs me at more levels than I can count.  First off, I think about the^?
women that participated in this thing.  To enter a "pagent" where the end^?
result is that you will marry someone you've never seen or met, and who's^?
background you know nothing about is just disturbing.  I've got this image^?
of a bunch of women who went through the pain of implants or other cosmetic^?
surgery, just to enhance themselves for the day when they would eventually^?
go out with or marry a "millionaire".  Then we get to the millionaire^?
himself.  To actually be desparate enough for a "trophy wife" and attention^?
that you have to set up this circus on TV is just twisted.^?
^?
All of this being said, I like money as much as the next guy.  I look forward^?
to the day when I can have enough money in some decent funds so that I don't^?
"have" to work.  I would still work, but it would be so cool to have that backup^?
so that I could either do my own thing, or not worry if the company I was working^?
for was going to crumble.^?
^?
I just can't believe how some of the people who have gotten to that self-sufficient^?
point don't remember where they came from.  I also can't believe how much others are^?
willing to change themselves from who they really are or who are willing to sleep with^?
or marry someone just to get that attention and/or money.
