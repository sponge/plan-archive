I generally try not to make a plan update without information relevant to
the company I'm working for, but I'm making an exception this time for
2 reasons.

The first is to say that Deus Ex is excellent.  My hat is off to Warren and
his team in Austin.  This game is definately a shining star for my former
employers and it's more than worth the time and money I've put into it (and
I'm still only halfway through the game).

I won't say much about the game itself since I don't want to spoil it for
anyone, but I can say that it's probably the best use of space that I've
ever seen in a game.  The real estate in the maps is used very well to give
you lots of territory to explore.

The second exception is to say that the XMen was an excellent film.  I'll
tell you what makes this, in my opinion, the best comic book film made to
date.  Camera work.

Ever since I saw Darkman, I've thought "This is how a comic book should be
filmed."  Surreal camera work, for me, is the key to really making a comic
book come to life.  I liked the first Batman a lot, but when I was done
watching it, I felt like I had just watched a film.  There wasn't anything
surreal about the presentation of the movie.  The same goes for Superman.

When I came out of watching XMen, the direction was so surreal that I
felt more like I'd just watched a comic book in motion.  Add to that the
fact that Hugh Jackman did the best job I've ever seen of bringing a
comic book character to life, and you've got a hell of a film.  My wife is
not a comic book fan at all, and she loved the movie as well, so it even
has appeal for those that don't know the characters in question.

So, I highly recommend playing Deus Ex, and seeing XMen.
