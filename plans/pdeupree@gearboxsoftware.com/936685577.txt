Working in C++ again in the Half Life game code is very, very cool.  I've
been working on the characters in the game.  I started by putting in the
friendly grunts.  We have a test map Randy talked about in his .plan
update with 3 friendly grunts next to you that you can use, plus 3 in
another room that repel down from the ceiling.

If you use them they follow you and you can enter a room with 12 enemies
and at that point all hell breaks loose.  I don't want to give away too
much, but suffice it to say there are grenades, green goo, and
electricity everywhere (and eventually dead bodies).  Recently I got the
medic in there also which is cool.  The one Randy saw didn't quite have
the code in yet to heal other squad members, but I've got that in now.

Now I'm working on a sub-boss that I won't say anything about, but this
guy should be pretty cool.

On the somewhat personal front, the new Gearbox office we just moved to a
few weeks ago is about 5 minutes from my house as opposed to the 30 minute
drive I had to make to downtown Dallas.  I have to say that I do NOT miss
driving down the Central Expressway every day to get to and from work.
