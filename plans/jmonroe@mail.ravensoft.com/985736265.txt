big news from my wife:

hi there,

zane frederic monroe was born on wednesday, march 21st at 10:11 pm.  his birth weight was 9 lb., 15 oz., and he was 21 and a half inches long.  a big boy!  he was born by c-section after i was in labor for about 12 hours; at that point my blood pressure was way high, and i had only dilated to 5 centimeters.  i was absolutely ecstatic to get the birth part over with.  we just came home today, and i'm still very tired.  he's an excellent baby.  more information and pictures will be available sometime, but i can't guarantee when.  the next couple of weeks will be very busy, packed with visitors.

happily,
ann
