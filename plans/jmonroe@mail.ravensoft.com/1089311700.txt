Kenn Hoekstra (formerly) at Ravensoft, had released the original Player model animation source files for Elite Force. But I forgot the .ase and .ask files that we used for the root and heads.  so here's  yet another archive for ya with those files.
I threw in carcass.exe to the new ase zip as well, since i'm not sure which archive had it.  (this is the tool which processes those .car files.) {theoretically, i haven't messed with this stuff in a Loooong time.}
