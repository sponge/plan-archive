Elite Force SDK update:

fixed a bug, (thanks maxbowsher)
Correct behaviour:
outputFilename set to argv[2]
OLD behaviour:
outputFilename set to argv[1] - i.e. '-o'

reget the package from here:

i also noticed why it only worked as a Debug build, so now it's Release and should be a couple of times faster.

oh, and i replaced the batch files with the ones SA made, which should work in win95.
