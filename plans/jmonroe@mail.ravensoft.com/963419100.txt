And speaking of MDR files...

Now that people have our Demo (see www.ravensoft.com)
and are wanting to mess with our carcass models.
I'm release a prelim version of our modified MD3Viewer.

it reads q3 style md3s and raven mdr skeletal
it can read both q3 animation.cfg and raven style
you can use the fkeys to preview LODs.
you can import skins to preview, (and it supports the talking animations via f4)

email me for it (98K), or check www.telefragged.com.

we can't support it, but i will release the source once we're done.



p.s. bloody hysterical comic here!
