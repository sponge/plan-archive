a few of us went out to see Trekkies (http://www.trekdoc.com/) the other day.  wow.
There are some very intense people out there, and we will work hard to please them!
but i can see it is going to be a tough battle to satisfy all the trekkies and trekkers.


btw, check out this month's copy of PCGamer.  First published article on ST Voyager: Elite Force!
