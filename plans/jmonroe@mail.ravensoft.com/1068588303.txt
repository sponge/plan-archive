Star Wars(TM) Jedi Knight(TM) : Jedi Academy(TM) Update ReadMe
Version 1.01
10/29/2003

##############################################################

Thank you for downloading the Jedi Academy(TM) Update.

Global

Fixed dynamic glow for new ATI drivers (if you are 
experiencing low framerate, go into Setup - More Video and 
change dynamic glow to off).
Updated EAX 4.0 sound support.

Single Player fixes

Force feedback defaults to off (if you are experiencing hiccupping 
while playing, especially during lightsaber battles, go into 
Controls - Mouse/Joystick and set force feedback to "No").  
Note:  Gravis gamepad users should turn force feedback to off.  
Gravis drivers aren’t compatible with Jedi Academy and will 
cause the game to crash.
Patch will work around manufacturing defect which causes 
single player not to run.
Resetting defaults in game will no longer reset your skill level.
Fixed bug allowing player to select a force power that had already 
been maxed out.
Fixed animation issue if enemies force push you while executing a 
special move.
Ragdoll fixes.

Multiplayer fixes

Fixed bug causing Internet servers to time out too early on master 
server list.
Fixed bug causing various movement sounds not to play consistently 
(footsteps, rolling, etc.).
Fixed bug regarding turning off of second saber.
Fixed bug preventing camera shake if hit by explosive.
Fixed roll animation.
Fixed exploit allowing for illegal character models.
Fixed bug allowing rocket launcher lock-on after death.
Various exploit fixes.

***************************************************************
Please note: Server admins must update their servers to the new 
1.01 code.  This may take a few days and 1.01 multiplayer games 
may be scarce until all servers upgrade to 1.01.
