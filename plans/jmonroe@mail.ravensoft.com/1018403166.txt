I just released new <a href="http://www.jediknightii.net/files/index.php?category=5"> dedicated JK2 servers </a> for linux and win32.

* fixed a uninitialized variable in the glm model loader which *may* have been causing a crash after a player joins. (this was a dedicated only bug)
* fixed a bug in the code which runs the VMs that was causing the "opStack corrupted in compiled code" (this was the normal executable as well as the dedicated-only binaries.)
Thanks to Rick for fixing this nasty little bugger!
