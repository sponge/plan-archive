<b>This update for the game has been modified to:</b> 
---------------------------------------------
* Provide EAX® 3.0 and OpenAL support. To enable these options, you will need to enable 3D Sound in the Sound Setup menu.
At the time of release of this update, EAX 3.0 is only supported on the Creative Labs Inc. SoundBlaster® Audigy(TM) and Extigy(TM) sound cards.

NOTE: This feature is not supported on Aureal® Vortex and Vortex 2 sound cards. Enabling this feature with a card with one of these chipsets may cause the game to lock up.

<b>Multiplayer:</b> 
-----------
* Include 4 new Multiplayer Duel levels
 (duel_bespin, duel_temple, duel_hangar, and duel_training)

-------------
* Provide Force Feedback for mouse and joystick. (this replaces the limited support in the release version)
 
<b>Corrects:</b>
-------------------------------------------
<b>Multiplayer:</b>
-----------
* Corrects an issue where players were unable to cycle to detonator packs and trip mines on the “explosives” key unless they also had Thermal Detonators.
* Corrects an issue that prevented launching a multiplayer game on AMD(TM) dual processor machines.
* Corrected an exploit to prevent players from using illegal models in the game.
* Corrected an exploit that allowed players to have force powers outside of what the server rules allow.
* Added an icon that appears over the player's head when the player is chatting or configuring force powers.
* Backflip now requires that you double tap the jump button.
* Lightsaber usage in multiplayer has been modified to work similarly to the way it works in single player levels. This will enable better saber battles up close with your opponent.
* Lightsabers will do less damage at the very start and very end of a swing. This should prevent kills from just touching an opponent with the tip of your lightsaber.
* Other players will not see the glow from a player using force absorb until they are attacked.
* Force Heal and Force Drain have been adjusted to require more force energy to use them.
* Corrected an issue that prevented lightsaber locking from occurring in duels even if it was enabled by the server.
* Correct various Duel mode issues, including:

* Reconfiguring force powers will not place your player at bottom of queue.
* If one player leaves during a match when dueling with more than 1 kill limit, the next person in line will not enter the match with the score of the person who left the match.
* Changing skins will no longer produce a loss score on HUD that includes fraglimit.

-------------
* Corrected an issue arising from the third AT-ST on Artus_Topside disappearing which prevented Jan from landing.
* Corrected an issue that caused enemies not to be alerted by the body of a comrade in their field of vision.
* Corrected an issue where enemies did not try to avoid thermal detonators that were thrown at them.
* Corrected an issue that would cause the player to be unable to attack for about thirty seconds if they were force pushed out of a saberlock.
