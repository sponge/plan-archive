Attention JK2 players with a new Matrox card, like the Parhelia.  
If you are experiencing slow performance you may be able to bring the game back up to speed by allowing GL extensions.  
By default, extensions are disabled for Matrox cards because the drivers for some older cards would crash otherwise.
Matrox informs me that the new Parhelia will work fine with extensions on.  You can enable them from the Video menu, or by typing at the console:

r_allowExtensions 1
vid_restart

enjoy,
