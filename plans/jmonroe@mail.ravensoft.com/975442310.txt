patch news:  
okay, i got back the official word on our patch!
"If all goes well, we should get the patch out by the end of the week, as all the major sweeps on the new code are completed. We just have to confirm that this single patch will work across the board on all released languages."

this will make it very easy on everybody as there will only be one download for all languages. instead of hundreds of minor revisions and multiple languages.

please join me in keeping our respective fingers crossed.
