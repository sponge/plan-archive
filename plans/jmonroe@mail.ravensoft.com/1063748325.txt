Getting ready for the Jedi Academy Launch:

And now, the Dedicated servers!  (these binaries are just for running a server, you will need a full RETAIL copy of the game to use them.)

PLEASE NOTE!
You must have the RETAIL version of the game.  If you happen to have a pre-release or evaluation version, please take it down today as it will NOT work with the actual retail version.

Introducing JEDI_ACADEMY_ModelsAndAnimation.zip

 
This archive contains files that may benefit you in creating your own custom models and skins for Star Wars:Jedi Knight:Jedi Academy.
 
contents:
A models and skinning guide from JK2 with a new introduction for JA.

Unpainted skins for many of the models.

Modview.exe to view models.

Skeleton information for the main humanoids and other creatures and ships.  (this is really only useful to the l33t modelers who have figured out our crazy gla files. :)  but it should help by declaring the bone names and hierarchy.)
