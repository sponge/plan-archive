Raven Software is now offering for download, the script compiler for Hexen (acc-source.zip: 113KB), used to compile the level scripts that were used to control things like keys and doors, etc. 
This program is being offered so users can make modifications to the compiler, when using the previously released Hexen source code. 
Although this software isn't supported, if you have any technical questions, you can send an email to James Monroe.
