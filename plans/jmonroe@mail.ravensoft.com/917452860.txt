Been toying with ideas on scripting systems - trying to plan for one which can fully integrate with the AI system so we don't run into hassles like we did with H2.


at home,
watched the Avengers.  against my friends advice. but, hey!  it was a free DVD rental, so it was worth a shot.
but alas, no.  it left such a bad taste that we had to watch Austin Powers to feel good again.

watched Sid n Nancy last night.  thought it might give some insight to my wacky friend, who at one point, ran out of a club screaming "I am sid vicious".
go  here  and look for Wacky Friends to find out about her.  The movie is pretty messed up. so i suppose it does resember her to some extent.
