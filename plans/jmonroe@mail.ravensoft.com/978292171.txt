Raven website patch snafu.
OOPs.  we accidentally uploaded a zip file of a pre-release patch.  this is not a valid patch and MUST NOT BE USED!  It will not work with other versions or the server lists.

the bad, Oct 25 patch 1.10 came in a ZIP file called efpatch110.zip. It contains two executables, two DLLs, and a pak1.pk3.
The good, Nov 10 patch 1.10 came in an EXE file called EliteForcePatch1_1.EXE which automatically installs the new files in the correct place.

i just corrected the raven site, so if anybody downloaded a zip file named efpatch11.zip, please get the correct version immediately.
