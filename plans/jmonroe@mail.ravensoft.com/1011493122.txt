okay, since i can't talk about what i'm doing at work, (it's just too cool, you'd faint - trust me.)

I'll tell you what i was thinking about at home:
We have a ton of CDs at home, and i started to consider Sony's 400 disc mega changer again.  It just seemed like an overkill 5 years ago, but now it make sense.  I checked prices at <a href = "http://www.800.com/prod.asp?P=3446"> 800.com</a>, only $299, okay.  But wait, this thing is big and bulky, you have to type in the disc info by hand, it should be digital.  

I've seen things like the <a href = "http://www.archos.com/us/products/product_500096.html"> Archos portable player</a> for around $300 before.  But it only has a 6GB drive for a capacity of about 150 CDs.  I swear i just saw some news on a similar, but larger capacity product at CES - but i can't find it now.  I just looked, and found something new: Compaq's <a href = "http://athome.compaq.com/showroom/static/ipaq/music_center.asp"> iPAQ Music Center</a>  it holds 400 cds and has an impressive feature set, but costs about $800 - ouch.

Then i found the <a href = "http://www.techtv.com/products/consumerelectronics/story/0,23008,3366931,00.html"> Moxi Media Center</a>, the jack of all trades, do everything box.  Oh my god.  finally they're making the products i've been dreaming of.  here's a quote from techtv: "the Moxi MC will play your DVDs and CDs, act as a cable or DSL router, store your digital music, and function as a PVR, all in one box."  current estimated price: $450.  If this works, and comes out soon, I won't need to research UltimateTV any more.  It'll solve all my needs.  Doesn't that seem too good to be true?
