Linux Dedicated Server Patched v1.10

http://www.3ddownloads.com/showfile.php3?file_id=112904

---------------------------------------------
Attention Holomatch Modders!
your dreams are answered, I've released the source code for HoloMatch game play:

here's the zip: http://www.3ddownloads.com/showfile.php3?file_id=112601 

and here: http://www.voyagereliteforce.com/files.asp?dir=/official&file=STEF-gamesource110.zip

if you've worked on quake3 mods, you'll recognize the setup. 
the batch files work fine in NT but have trouble running in 98. i think you have to edit the individual batch files to make it work in 98.

e.g. game.bat has a line at the top like:
set cc=blah
then later it has
%cc% ../g_main.c

you'll need to replace the %cc% with the blah.
