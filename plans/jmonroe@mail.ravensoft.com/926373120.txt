well, been a long time since i've had time to write...
We are busy gearing up for E3.  So all you lucky enough to go will get a first peek there, and there should be a magazine article following shortly for the rest of you.

when i get back from e3, i'll have a lot more to say about what we've been doing and planning for star trek voyager.

btw:
can anyone recommend a QuickTime VR development tool?  I have tried the demo of VR Pano Worx and it seems pretty good.  or maybe a Live-Picture pano tool?
