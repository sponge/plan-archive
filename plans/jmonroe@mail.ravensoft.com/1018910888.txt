Oh what fun, it is to crash servers.

I just released Version C <a href="http://www.jediknightii.net/files/index.php?category=5"> dedicated JK2 servers </a> for linux and win32.

Version C:
*fixed the exploit that could crash the servers by sending an empty connect message.
*minor improvements to the win32 dedicated console (tab "complete" and one-line history)

previous fixes:
* fixed a uninitialized variable in the glm model loader which *may* have been causing a crash after a player joins. (this was a dedicated only bug)
* fixed part of a bug in the code which runs the VMs that was causing the "opStack corrupted in compiled code" (followup note: it didn't fix all of the opStack corrupted errors.)
Thanks to Rick for fixing this nasty little bugger!
