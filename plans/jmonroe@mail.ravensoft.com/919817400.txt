okay, we've talked a lot about you, the gamer and how to serve you best.
my question for the day, (week, month, whenever i think of another one...) is about user mods to games.
The heretic2 team spent some considerable effort to make it easier for users to make mods.  I wonder how much it matters in the end.

This is just me asking, nothing to do with raven, activsion, or your pc or that pencil over there.
