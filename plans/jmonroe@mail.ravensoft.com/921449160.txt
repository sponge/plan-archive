many thanks, my gamma informed patrons.

i now know about

gl_modulate	=	3.5 worked for me	
and
intensity	= don't know what this does

, now if i could keep it from hanging when i hit esc from the menu....

btw, i run NT so there is no desktop gamma control,
and i have a really freaking dark monitor with the brightness all the way up which is the cause of my woes.

now am prepared to be impressed...



different thought:
i just found out about ORB, from www.castlewood.com
