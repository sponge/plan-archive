'been looking at our master server for the past couple of days.  we've been getting flooded by a few servers recently.
this one (adsl-208-191-243-16.dsl.ltrkar.swbell.net [208.191.243.16]) has been confusing the server for a while.  it seems that it is a DSL router.  it must be misconfigured to block our return packets and the master server keeps trying to check it - continuously!  

if i had any spare time, i'd try to update the master server code to handle this more gracefully... sigh.  i'll get to it when i can.
