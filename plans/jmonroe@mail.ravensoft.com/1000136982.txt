As many of our Trek fans are aware, for the past couple of weeks, we've been releasing the source .map files from Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force to:

http://www.3ddownloads.com/?directory=/eliteforce/official/Map%20Files/

In case you've been busy with other things, now you know they're out!
If you've always wondered how we managed to make the "awesome swinging pendulums(tm)" or wondered about the finer points of scripting NPCs, grab these files now, and examine away!
