here's some tips for the day concerning cds,

when labeling, be sure to write on the NON-data side.  i know this sounds obvious,
but i was recently sent one with a blue data side and a silver side ready for a label, not the normal gold with writing.  so i guess the person made a simple error mistaking the silver side for data.  luckily, the writing was outside the data track, so no harm done.

never use a ball-point pen!  this one might not be so obvious.  but i got one with the gold writing surface, with writing attempts visible.  i didn't forsee any problems, but there was a data error on the disk on certain files.  i flipped it over to inspect the data tracks, and, sure enough, i could see a few letters shining through the reflective backing behind the data medium.  really odd, you can't tell from the gold side, it must have been the pressure.

here's something i found out.  i can't remeber where i read about it, but i have first hand knowledge that some DVD drives cannot read burned (not commercially pressed) cds.  has to do with the laser focus i think.  i really should remember where i read these things...
