Attention win95/98 users attempting to compile the VMs!

Win98 does not support the set command that my batch files use.  You can fix it by doing a search and replace on the set command.

everywhere you see 'cc' you have to replace it with the text to the right of the = sign below:

set cc=......inlcc -A -DQ3_VM -DMISSIONPACK -S -Wf-target=bytecode -Wf-g -I....cgame -I....game -I....ui

cc ../g_main.c

becomes:
......inlcc -A -DQ3_VM -DMISSIONPACK -S -Wf-target=bytecode -Wf-g -I....cgame -I....game -I....ui   ../g_main.c


sorry for the troubles, but win98 sucks in this reguard.
