<p>*!* first, id like to add that none of my opinions reflect my employer - 3DRealms Entertainment *!*

<p>In light of the recent events in Colorado, it seems that the whole country has taken a shot (no pun intented) at 'the answer' to it all.  They are all looking for the one thing that will make everything all better and make all the 'bad people' go away.  Well as we all know it's not that simple....

<p>I'd like to pass along a site that has shared my feelings on many occasions in more topic than one.  I know most of you are probably on the mailing list already, but for those that aren't, it's very informative.  

<p>On the front page is an article called 'THE THIRTY-POINT PROGRAM TO REBOOT AMERICA'.  Personally, I think it is one of the most accurate and intelligent articles I've read since the whole thing happened, which doesn't throw blame left and right.  I feel any free thinking, intelligent, individual should agree here.  Take his words to heart, he's a wise man.
