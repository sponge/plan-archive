<p>Out of curiosity...is there anyone in the DFW area that can supply me with a list of any good rockNroll/punk shows or bands or happenings?  I think I've been out of the loop for way too long.  

Thanks in advance....

<p>Hey, I'd like to make a correction to the article that Brandon wrote for GameSpy a couple of 
days ago....

<p>You can link to the article <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/september00/greenmarine/">here</a>.

<p>In it, Brandon says, '3D Realms has a motion capture studio in-house and brings in 
external actors.'  This is only half true  ;)  The only external actors we have ever brought in 
have been female.  The reason being, we currently don't have any females working at the company 
and I seriously doubt I could act out the subtleness of female movement on my own.  Along with 
the fact that I'm sure most of you would probably oppose to knowing that the sultry dancing being performed by the stripper you'll see on stage was actually performed by a guy.  I know I would.  It would just ruin the whole mood, wouldn't it?  ;)

<p>So in closing, all of the acting/movement for DNF (so far) has been done in house except for the girls.  And thank goodness for that too!
