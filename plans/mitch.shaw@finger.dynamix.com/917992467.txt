 For those of you who want a different shaped
or colored crosshair for Tribes, I cobbled up a
small collection of different ones -- circular,
tiny dots, etc. in a variety of fashionable colors.
I'll zip them all up and put them on my old
GeoCities screen shot page for anyone who's
interested -- the URL for that is
http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Dunes/8338

 Don't expect much from this page -- I just threw
together some screen shots a couple of months ago
before the game came out, and added some lame
attempts at funny captions. The link for the zip
file should be near the top of the page, above the
screen shots. Unfortunately, there isn't any way
of keeping track of the number of downloads, so if
you grab it and find it useful (or have suggestions
for new, useful crosshairs), drop me an e-mail if
you would be so kind.

 The file should be up on the GeoCities page by
2:00 PM PST today. I'll throw a README in too, but
just in case you're one of the 95% who don't bother
to read such files -- unzip the zip file (duh) and
browse thru the BMPs. (I recommend ACDSee) If you
find one you like, copy it to your tribesase
directory and rename it to H_Reticle.BMP (if you
don't do this, your crosshair will not change).
Enjoy!

 Oh yeah, and I almost forgot, happy birthday Mom.
