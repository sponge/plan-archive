I've been following the controversy over the recommended Wolf MP Punk Buster cvar restrictions. Although I support people playing the game as they choose I believe that altering cvar settings to create an advantage forces other players to do the same or compete at a disadvantage. Eventually, players who would not normally choose to adjust their graphics to low or odd settings are forced to do so to remain competitive. To keep this from happening a set of common standards should be applied equally. The only standards id can recommend are those which keep the game closest to how it was originally designed. These recommendations are not fixed. Server admins are free to change these ranges or run with no restrictions at all. However, these are the standards that best represent the game as it was intended to be played.
