DISCLAIMER: Regardless of what you read below, I agree with you. 

It is cool that people are enjoying the new DM stuff and CTF. 
Zoid is excellent to work with and did a great job. I hope we can
do similar projects in the future. From the comments and criticisms
I've read it sounds like a ton of people are playing Quake 2. 
Thanks for giving us your feedback. Except for software pirates. 
Software pirates suck and are excluded from our End-User Beta 
testing group. 

Personal Update:
I'm leaving work tonight and won't be back until tommorrow morning.
I ate a cool Schlotzky Original today that cost me $5.76. I gave the
girl six bucks and told her to keep the change. 

Movies I've watched lately:
1. Cinderella: Did anyone else think the step mother was a hotty?

Books I've read lately:
1. But Not The Hippopotamus: A sad story where everyone is doing 
cool stuff, but not the Hippopotamus.

Other Stuff:
We had some problems with partial downloads of 3.12 which resulted
in a number of false bugs. Looks like we'll be moving to a zip file
for the next patch.

I know most people don't care, but just for the record Activision
did not pressure id to release. Quake 2 is the best action game
out there. However looking back, we should have sent out a 
multiplayer test demo. I know a number of other multiplayer games 
have similar problems. However, id software has the reputation
of being the best, and you guys expect more from us.

PS. Activision made me write this and email it before I was finished.
Therefore, it may have errars. Don't ask me about deadlines. We're done
when you finish testing it!
