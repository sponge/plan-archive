DISCLAIMER: Regardless of what you read below, I agree with you. 

Congratulations to Ritual on the release of the Sin demo. I hadn't
had so much fun playing a 3D game in a long time. I can't wait to 
play the final game.

Adrian and I are looking for a 2d texture artist to help create wall
textures, skins, and interface graphics. Any one interested should 
send their resume to me at kevinc@idsoftware.com. I am looking for 
someone skilled as a traditional artist, with strong 2d art talent 
and good modeling experience. Experience as a professional computer
artist is required with a preference on someone who has worked on 3D
games. I'm looking for a person willing to put in strong hours, is
easy to work with, and doesn't require a lot of oversight.
