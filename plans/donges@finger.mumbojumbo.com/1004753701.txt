Well, it's been an interesting week that has capped an interesting and rewarding year.  More than anything else, the Irvine crew would like to thank the people out there in the community that have supported the franchise.  Whether you agree with the direction that we have taken or not, you have kept Myth alive, made this third game possible and allowed us to bring together this team to bring it to you.  To a person, we have taken an incredible amount of pride in our accomplishment.  We have been a bit quiet over the last week, in order to capture feedback on the game.  Believe me that we have been paying close attention to what we have seen and compiling a list of the issues and comments that have cropped up.  MumboJumbo will be releasing a patch within the week to resolve a great number of these issues.  This patch will focus mainly on fixing up issues that have plagued the MultiPlayer User Interface and some important compatibility issues.  When it is ready for release, it will be available from Take 2's support website and we'll get the word out to you.
A word on the Mac version...it is very close, and MacSoft is gearing it up for the holiday season.  They are as committed as us in getting it to the eager Mac users.  The fact of the matter is that we ran into some unforeseen issues that have caused it to take us a bit longer to get it ready for release.  I don't think that the few extra weeks of practice that the PC users have will do them any good once the Mac users start hitting GameSpy (this coming from an ex_Applite).  Good luck, y'all.
