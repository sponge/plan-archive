Well, we are getting very close here.  The game is looking better than I would have ever imagined.  We are now accepting applications for internal beta testers in both our Irvine, CA and Dallas offices.  If you live nearby either of those locations, and are serious about giving us a hand testing Myth 3 on Mac and PC, please go to testing.mumbojumbo.com and fill out the Internal Testing sign-up form.  Please only fill out the form if you REALLY live near one of our offices and if you REALLY do want to spend some serious time testing.  We will be testing 7 days a week, so there is plenty of space available.  And for those not lucky enough to live in Dallas or Irvine (hmmm...lucky?), your wait will be over soon.  Have no fear.

Remember, testing.mumbojumbo.com

Thanks,

Mike
