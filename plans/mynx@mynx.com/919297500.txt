Just 3 points to cover this evening:

1) Feb 18 column has been completed and will be posted on time.  This Week:  Testicle size insecurity, answering that age old "does size really matter?" question, when old folk get it on where people can hear them, a Quake dude and his arousing keyboarding chick, some wack gal with id-lust, and a reader contributed Embarrassment Spotlight that brings a whole new mental image to "working late".  Kumbaya. 

2) For all of those freaks who kept mailing me about Mental's damn Ultima page, it's back.  http://ultima.scorched.com.  Now go bug him instead.

3) Tinky Winky rules.

Tomorrow's my birthday (the big two-five) and since the birthday rules say I get to do whatever I want, today's column will consist of some of my favorite Embarrassment Spotlights - the whole damn thing!  Relive Paul Steed's erection, KillCreek's bladder trouble, Tom Hall's fartypants, and others...  

Oh, and I'm probably shooting myself in the foot here, but:  If any more of you smackheads send me that fucking .avi, I am going to send it back to you ten times.  Don't ever ever EVER send me uninvited attachments, unless it's a .jpg, and then only if it's a shot of you naked.  Dig?
