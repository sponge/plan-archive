This week's column is finished, sent in and ready for posting.  In the midst of e3 getting down and dirty, don't be surprised if the column shows up at some wack time (hi crispy!).

The headline:

This Week:  What to do with a gay Quake player ("not that there's anything wrong with that.."), self love as witnessed by a sibling, Quake apathy because of a chick, hot and sweaty Quake, and some guy writes in about his backdoor wife love.  Quake 3 is out - quit pestering me.
