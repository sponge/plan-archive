Sorry, guys.  The little one has come down with chicken pox.  Oh yes, I'm SO thrilled we had him vaccinated against it (needlessly, obviously).  

As such, I'm burrowing in to take care of him and will return to you next week.  Riot in the streets if you must, but be sure to send me your agonies, 'k?
