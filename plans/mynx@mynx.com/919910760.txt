It's that time of the week again, kids.  Tomorrow's column is complete, sent, and will be posted on time.  This week's bits of yummy include:  
An old saggy Canuck who Quakes with the best of 'em, evil females in a big hot net.love tamale, grunting like dear old dad in the heat of passion, the rumor mill flies around in a big fat circle, wondering if Mynx has a penis of her own and a new workplace wangodango.  You gotta love it. 

Stop by efnet #quake on 2/25 and wish my dear old dad Kilroy` a happy 52nd year on earth.  Maybe he'll wave his cane at you.  Happy birthday, daddy :)
