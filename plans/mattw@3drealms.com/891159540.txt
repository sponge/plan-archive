BWHAHAHAhahahahahaha   :D
hey the kittens still havnt been named yet, so if anyone has anymore suggestions for names, let me know.  to recap, i have 6  tiny  little kitties that i have yet to name.  which reminds me...if anyone lives in the Dallas area and would like one and would promise to let it grow big and strong and let it chase its tail til its dizzy (thats important), shoot me an email and we'll tawk.  theyre gonna go like hotcakes, so dont delay.  i only have like 2 (i think) that arent spoken for.  serious inquires only please.


e3 is gonna rawk this year.  ever-body 'll be there.  will you?  :p*
