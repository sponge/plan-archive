*!* first, id like to add that none of my opinions reflect my employer - 3DRealms Entertainment *!*

5 years.....ive waited 5 years for an engineer and a thumper!?!  they couldnt even give us one new house.  and how long did this take them to 'redo' one of thier existing games?  this constitues as an add-on in my books....and i paid full price for this.  im sorry, but for the quality of the actors theyve hired and the great FMV they are doing, at least they can spring for some better 'game' ideas.  i was SOOOO looking forward to this too.  what a waste of a great license....

long live Blizzard
