With Brandon's approval, I'd like to make a correction to the article that he wrote for GameSpy a couple of days ago....

You can link to the original article here.

In it, Brandon says, '3D Realms has a motion capture studio in-house and brings in 
external actors.'  This is only half true  ;)  The only external actors we have ever brought in have been female.  The reason being, we currently don't have any females working at the company and I seriously doubt I could act out the subtilty of female movement on my own.  Along with the fact that I'm sure most of you would probably oppose to knowing that the sultry dancing being performed by the girl you'll see on stage was actually performed by a guy.  I know I would.  It would just ruin the whole mood, wouldn't it?  ;)

So in closing, all of the acting/movement for DNF (so far) has been done in house except for the girls.  And thank goodness for that too!
