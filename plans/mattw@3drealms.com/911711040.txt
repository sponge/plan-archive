all pc games fall apart somewhere from when you start to when you either finish it or get so bored that you quit.  every game except half-life.  ive never been so into a single player experience before and loved every second of it.  these guys definatly did everything right......and i havent even played MP yet.

a very big CONGRATS to the Valve team.  youve earned it  :)
