this will be my first plan file so it will probably start off a little slow....

oh, one correction.  after my name im listed as an artist.  well, as much as i would like to think that i can even TRY to compete with some of the artists in the industry today, i am not one.  im one of the many game/level designers for prey.  just wanted to point that out.

this isnt industry related but i wanted to wish a get well to my bro who got his foot(literally) broken off in a football accident.  hes got pins and casts and crutches and hooks and all sorts of nasty things in him.  needless to say hes not walking for quite some time.  at least he can spend this time to get better at Jedi Knight and Q2....  ;)

well til next time, true believers...
