** 2/4/98  **

you know, i think the productivity of my day is directly due to what is played on my radio when i wake up and on my way to work in my car.  i mean, most of the time it is total crap, but every once and awhile theyll play a good song and have a great day because of it.  the other day was the Ramones, and others i cant remember.  today was the Cure and Bosstones and somebody else.  well, needless to say, ive been having a pretty good week so far.  of course id have a much better week if radios started playing like Lagwagon or Diesel Boy or something.  speaking of Lagwagon...i couldve sworn i heard a snip from (i think) Whipping Boy in the beginning of the movie Contact.  it was right when the camera was leaving earth.  i guess that was thier 'modern' punk token 'for the kids'  ;).  then again maybe not, maybe Robert Zemeckis (sp?) really digs them. :)    if anybody else heard this, let me know.  i wanna make sure im not delusional.  late

 T0NkA wanted the asterisks for pac-man to eat instead of the dashes.  i guess its better for him.  also, the T0Nkster will be on QuakeCast this Thursday @ 9 or so i think.  check dat m0f0 out.

ok, i tried a little java and had Pac-Man bouncing around all over the screen, but it seems that PQ didnt like it or somthing.  not sure.  but i looked really spiffy i swear.

ever notice that when you turn the 'IHOP' menus upside down, they spell 'doH!'....?  coincidence??  i think not.
