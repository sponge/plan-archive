i thought this would be pretty cool.  course for this to all work, you have to be using a graphic broswer.  not sure what version tho.  keep your eye on the fishies

ever notice that when you turn the 'IHOP' menus upside down, they spell 'doH!'....?  coincidence??  i think not.




 Since you're not using Netscape 4.0, you don't get to see the little fishies swim all over the screen! (sob, sniffle)
