the picture over there is courtesy of the legend and phenom known as  t0nka.  which, incidentally is a representation of me being well...just really pissed off.  this is her description of the pic-
"a collaborative effort between mr.sockm and myself.  
                         well actually i did the basic pic, then he got all shiznitty about the
                         details.  it does look better after he did that though... oh and he fixed
                         his tattoo."

i figure if anyone is going to the event formerly known as Quake Con this weekend, youll be able to spot me out easier thanks to the art of da t0nkstah.  my hair is not as light as it is in that pic anymore tho.  so stop and say 'hey'.  hope to see you there....
