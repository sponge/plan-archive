Introduction: Lee Perry, I've been with IonStorm for around 2 months now.  I'm fresh from
SQUARE USA in the LA R&D division, and prior to that I worked at Black Ops Entertainment in
Santa Monica. I guess it's about time I do my part to clog the ungodly number of plan file
sites, and since it's my B-day today, what better gift can there be but a shiny new file?
I'll be updating pretty regularly in the future, giving away lots of industry secrets...
oops... wait that's not right!
