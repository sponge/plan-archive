A correspondence with Tom Hall, submitted for your dissapproval:

ME: (to our game addicts list) Is Ghost in the shell out yet?
TOM: The game?  If you're wondering if you missed the film, man, you are BEhind
  the times
ME: No, I meant the game.  I was wondering cause a few web sites were posting
  codes, but I was pretty sure it wasn't out yet... odd.
TOM: The Breakfast Cereal?  (OK, this is where it all just went awry)
ME: No, that was O's in the shell, wait, or was it choco-ghost-in-the-shellula with
   real mar-Shirow-mallows?
TOM: Whoops, I meant the Breakfast Serial-- the TV show shown at 7 a.m. Each show ends
   with some hot robot chick falling through the air slow, saying something dumb about
   "the Net".
ME: What? There's a Saturday morning version?
TOM: Wait, I meant the Breakfast Serial Bus, which takes early morning downtime to
   upload.
ME: AARG! I'M SOOO CONFUSED!! There was no bus in Ghost in the shell was there? And
   I think cyborgs eat Oil-O's for breakfast out of a pan, I might be wrong on that
   one though.
TOM: Oh, No, I mean a Break-Faster reel, which allowed a runaway kite to be curtailed
   Sometimes, the reel could be used with Oil-O's, which is how you can oilpanfish.
   I think I've gone way off into the area of half-puns, so though I thought my ideas
   were vast, I found they were half-vast.
ME:  (After realizing the subject was now "Shows in the gel") I prefer the patented
   Popeil Pocket Rocket Fisher Launcher to the reel of which you speak, it makes jerky
   too and still makes Julian Fries in just nano-seconds!
TOM: How did you know I just ate jerky?  You are a vision in the chamber, you are the
   wizard in the keep, you are the... Ghost in the Shell!  Stick a fork in the f**ker
   it's duuuuuun.  Ah Ron Popeil, Show me again how to spray paint my head
ME:  Slim Jims are just wrong, though they contain lactic acid, something your body
   needs anyway...
TOM:  Ever try "Fat Jims"? They're really wrong.  Then the "Way the hell obese jims"
   go too far.

At this point I must break off, Tom revealed the meaning og the universe to me and I
can't just go around spouting that off can I?  I'm so confused now...

Weekly game update: The Anachronox D&D game has moved to the apartment of Indigo and
Deadhorse (thanks muchly guys).  Much fun was had Monday night by most of the party
(those who could actually attack without dropping their weapons).  I'll be running the
adventure as soon as we finish off the local ruffians, got fun stuff planned!

Anachronox is moving along briskly, workin hard to get everything together by the end
of the month to show the big wigs at Eidos.  Code is beginning to be merged and we're
finally going to start seeing the fruits of all these animations.  I'm really really
excited with all the possibilities of our title based on the flexibility of our game.
I've hardly been able to sleep the past few nights because new ways of implementing
cool shit just keeps flooding my brain!  Man, this is going to be soooo cool!

D-Day... dum dum duuuuum!

Welp, several people on the team are out of whack with various illnesses (illni?) which
makes it a bit more difficult on the Eidos deadline, I can hardly bitch though when I
was out last Monday as well and having had several days in the past few weeks where I got
out of bed, felt like taking the plunger to my nose so I might actually be able to breath
through this Sinus nightmare of Dallas.  Nevertheless there's still quite a few things
to do, including one of the main characters who is exponentially difficult to animate due
to a large amount of hair all over his body, so I'm going to let this go and get the hell
back to animating.

On a side note the Champions game went well last night even if running later than usual.
My little martial artist had quite a fight on his hand taking down an opposing brick with
relatively minor injuries in the melee.  The highlight of my evening was my little asian
kid walking up to the game equivalent of the Hulk with a large sledgehammer and knocking
the weapon (which I'm not even strong enough to lift) from his hands.  Of course after
he retrieved the tool, the majority of my time was spent dodging my ass off so as not to
get thumped by it, but it still felt good to overpower a brick with a str 15 character.
(anyone who plays the heros system can surely empathize)

One of the construction workers for our upstairs office renovations chatted in the lobby
with a few of us about how well everything was going.  Most of the walls are up and being
"textured" as we speak.  I hope they vis the thing well I don't want to get any slowdown 
when cruising to the watercooler. Apparently we might just be getting in the cool new
suite a bit earlier than previously thought. WooHoo!

In the last stretch of the mass deadline so this will be short and sweet:

Found a cool mag (The official US playstation magazine) with an oh-so catchy title, ahem
yeah... anyway, it comes with a cool PSX demo disc on it (which is a first for the PSX)
including a demo of Parappa the Rappa (which is SOOOOO hip it is not to be believed!) and
a demo of another rockin little puzzle game called Intelligence Cube (Which we had as a
japanese version back at Square but I never played it, bummer) which I highly reccomend
as well.  Fighting Force looks pretty cool if you're into slug-fest titles as well.

Played D&D Sunday at Toms again and basically it amounted to us sitting around for some
6 hours counting gems (after the guys discovered my handy appraisal skill) and realising
for some reason we weren't 1st level anymore!  It was altogether a waste of a playing
session, but I did get to roust an old man so it wasn't a total loss of that special brand
of Lee charcater humor.

Last Tuesday my Champions game ran late supposedly because my bro was "making maps for the
adventure".  The joke came later when we realized quite quickly that all the enemies were
strickingly similar to the cast of FFVII and his idea of map research basically came down
to getting into FFVII and not wanting to stop to play the champs game.

Welp, I'm back on the job, later!

Well we're in the midst of animation hell about now. I can think of a few things I enjoy
a bit more than deadlines, like root canals, frontal lobotomies, getting to be cell-mates
with a man named bubba...

Had an amusing game of D&D this Sunday, we wound up with the entire party beaten like a
red headed step-child in the middle of a large lair (we're only first level for the most
part) and were actually given the choice of wether we wanted to just create new characters
or deal with the consiquences of being beaten unconcious and locked in what amounts to a 
Rancor mosters pit.  We chose to continue and woke up completely stripped of all our
goods, except tattered loin clothes (those generous kobolds, wee!).  It was great fun
about the time we had to start binding wounds with the only cloth we had... I won't get
into that though.

It wrapped up with two loin-clothed guys escaping from the lair, hauling my naked gnomish
ass and our heavy duty fighter's as well on their back while the remaining kobolds shot
volleys of crossbow bolts at us from behind... luckily I make a nice shield and absorbed
a great deal of the bolts... I was pleased at a job done well, I'm considering strapping
some leather to my butt and changing my character class to "light shield" :-P

Yeomans log:  oh, wait that's not right...  The artnachronox modelers have had a rockin
week.  With a horde of character models we've managed (in a week and a half) to produce
easily 3 times the characters most games use in their entire title.  Not to mention they
are some of the coolest models and designs I've ever had the pleasure of working with.
And hell, we're only about 15% or so through the design document... er bible.

Next week will begin the first massive animation effort as we begin to breath life into
the ungodly massive hordes of polys that lay before us.  Wee hee!  I think I can safely
say we've pulled off a level of productivity I've never seen at Square.

As a sidenote: I played FFVII until about 1:30 last night, and let me say DAMN! That's a
smokin game! Lookin forward to playing FFVII all weekend, well except D&D at Toms House
of Horror all day Sunday.  Should be a hoot, especially after my Tuesday night Champions
game with my Bro, Pmack over at Rogue, and a cast of regular playing buds fell through
due to unforseeable circumstances.  I'm Jonesin for RPGs BABY!

*************************************************
Been a busy little monkey!  Saw a page of my images from Square in this months GameFan
on page 112.  Apparently I'm destined to be buried with that damn monkey/mechabo image.
I'm not sure where they got the story information though, they claimed Square was running
our Chocobo De Battle game at 80 million polys a second (Hey! A monkey flew out my ass!)
when the most we ever optimistically expected was 5 million a sec.  Not to mention that
was on a 1.25 million dollar Onyx2 SGI with some 2 gigs of RAM, it would be ungodly hard
(not to mention cost prohibitive) to get performance like that in an arcade anytime soon.

On the Anachronox side, well, Tom & Jerry (if you'll forgive the pun) have picked a lead
artist for Anachronox and apparently it would be me.  I hope to get a load of rockin high
res images of the type Square was using for Chocobo De Battle, but for now we've got a
Chicken McShitload of poly models to get done ASAP, so high res will be on hold for a bit.

Final Fantasy VII, early released should be available today if you kiss the right ass, so
all you pre-ordered junkies get on the phone and start pestering for an early copy NOW!

Introduction: Lee Perry, I've been with IonStorm for around 2 months now.  I'm fresh from
SQUARE USA in the LA R&D division, and prior to that I worked at Black Ops Entertainment in
Santa Monica. I guess it's about time I do my part to clog the ungodly number of plan file
sites, and since it's my B-day today, what better gift can there be but a shiny new file?
I'll be updating pretty regularly in the future, giving away lots of industry secrets...
oops... wait that's not right!
