A couple of things, then a plea for help.

First up, congrats to Mucky Foot on a damn cool game. I picked up StarTopia this weekend, and it ROCKS.
A definite good first release.
*UPDATE*
Like an idiot I didn't check my facts did I? It seems that this is the *second* release for Mucky Foot. Apologies all round.
Thanks Jonathan Fingas for the heads up.
*UPDATE END*

Also, congrats go to Remedy and 3DR for finishing up Max Payne. I will wait with interest for this to show
up in stores.

Lastly, I need a bit of help. I've finished up my screen saver, and I want to release it to the world.
The issue is finding a decent (free) installer. I have the Install Shield Express installer that comes with
VC 6.0, but it's been mutilated so it doesn't do all that I need it too. Here's what I specifically need.
An installer that can handle
- modifying or creating .ini files
- the ability to stuff code directly into the windows/system dir
- the ability for the user to determine where they want data files to go
- the ability for the user to determine if they want to install the original source code or not.
and some compression would be nice.

So, anyone out there know of such a beasty? I'm not keen to sink cash into this, since I'm giving the
saver away free, along with the source code too. And it's a big one - lots of openGL 3d stuff going on.
Any sci-fi fan will love it. However, it is dependant on getting an installer together.
Feel free to drop me a line <a href="mailto:jsimpson@ravensoft.com">here.</a>

*UPDATE 2*
A number of people have pointed me at NUllSoft's installer, which appears to be what I need. Thanks one and all.
*UPDATE END*
