So, off in the Raven Jet with Chris Foster to the GDC. This is being written at
31,000 feet. A voice from On High ! :) 
Should be interesting I think. I've been looking forward to seeing all those
that have finger plans... If you see me wandering around, please, say hi. I'm 
weirdo with the really short hair and British accent. Ignore any sarcasm please :)
Since I'm not at Raven this week, I'm not sure of the status of the EP. Look to
Pat Lipo's finger for answers on that one.

For once, I have a request. This is a purely for personal reasons and has nothing
to do with Raven or any professional project done by them. I'm looking for textured
.3ds max models of star ships. Between 5000 and 10000 poly's each. I won't go into
why, just say its a personal learning project and hope that there are some modellers
out there that are reading this that are up to the challenge.
The ships in particular I am looking for :-

The Enterprise - original, A, B, C, D & E would be great.
Voyager.
Any and all Shuttle craft.
An X wing.
A Tie fighter.
A Star destroyer (that should be easy I would have thought)
The Falcon (yeah, right, in 10000 polys ??) 
The Liberator (Blakes 7, remember that ?)
A White Star (Babylon 5)
An Eagle (Space 1999 - now that one IS impossible in 10,000. Or is it ?)

Now, I've been to most of the free mesh websites, and while I've found some cool
models, they are all ridiculously expensive in the poly count, and while Max has a
cool poly reduction routine built in, it can screw your model sideways, when reducing
from 40,000 to 12,000 polys. Its been my experience that you really need to build the
model in the first place with that poly limit in mind. Anyway, I'm looking. Please
send all and any models of this sort of thing to me. You might even see it in a
little free ware program, if I ever get it finished...

Music of the day :- Anything other than the crap they pipe through these terrible
pnuematic headphones on this flight. Man these are bad. And its not as if the 
music selection is worth listening too. And where's the movie ???
Joke of the Day :-
Q Why was the neutered Cat called Tomorrow ?
A Cos Tomorrow never comes.
See ? More evidence of Jakes Sophisticated humour.
