Hey - I was just wondering if any of you Windows ME fanatics out there could give me a hand. I have some very cool USB 
speakers - decidely phallic, but that's apple for you:) - anyway, they are great and sound terrific. However, I just got a
shiny new USB logitech QuickCam - and by the way, thanks a ton Logitech for sending us all this great USB stuff, the 
vibrating mice are WAY cool - and it interfers with my speakers something chronic. I'm guessing there is only so much USB
bandwidth to go around, even though I don't get any "out of bandwidth" messages come up on boot, as I've seen before. Anyway
the effect is that my sounds get a ton of interference in them when the cam is operating. I'm using the default microsoft USB
sound drivers, (which don't appear to work properly anyway, the different volume sliders don't affect anything, except the main
one), and it's getting very depressing that I can't use the cam to update Jakeworld.
Anyone out there got any idea's?

Thanks for all the responses on the modding tutorials. I'm gonna get started on them as soon as I get done finishing my basement.
Look for them soon.

Oh, and by the way, go see Pay It Forward. It's a great movie. Why can't life be more like that? Except for the last
10 minutes of course.
