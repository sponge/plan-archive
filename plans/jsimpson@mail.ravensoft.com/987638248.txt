Well, now it's out in the open, we are doing SOF2. I've been working on building Ghoul2, which is our next generation
animation system. It's not actually based on Ghoul1 since that was mesh based, and Ghoul2 is all truely hirearchical
skeletal based. It still gives all the same sort of good stuff Ghoul1 one did, but it's got a host of new features
besides. Look for an interview on VoodooExtreme sometime soon that will give more details.

One other thing. The Press release mentioned our new ROAM terrain system. I'd like to clear up that it's not actually
the Real-time Optimally Adapting Meshes approach, but our own design and implementation. We should have done some more
research on the name before we adopted it. Expect that to change shortly, since we don't want to confuse anyone.

A last thing. Since I finished up the physical JakeWorld (IE my basement) I decided it was time to give JakeWorld the
website a makeover. Check out the link below - it has moved location, and it probably will change domain sometime soon.
I've added a new article that was published on Evil Avatar (and hardly linked by anyone. Thanks.), another interview I
did, I added Jessica Alba to the girls, there are new screensavers, new evils, and I finally got around to doing a .plan history.
