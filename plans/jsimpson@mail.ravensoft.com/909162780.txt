The Heretic II demo is out. Well sort of. The latest word is that we are *NOT* gold on the demo
as it stands right now. There are some issues that we will be addressing in a new release of the
demo, hopefully fixing them.

1) There is an intermitten crash when pushing buttons and switching weapons.
2) The skins swapping when changing weapons, this is annoying the hell out of us.
3) Hopefully we'll fix the load/save options and include them this time. - be aware though, that
almost certainly you won't be able to use you saves from the demo in the real game.
4) The shrine effects tend to go away after prolonged network play - something else we want to
address
5) The time limit that was left in by mistake. This was there for the E3 demo and we just plain
forgot to remove it. Mucho apologies on that one.
6) Other stuff. I don't have the comprehensive list infront of me right now.

Now, this patch won't be that big, since the levels themselves, and all the textures and sounds
everyone already has, it'll just be the .DLL's and the .EXE.

Remember, bug reports to heretic2bugs@mail.ravensoft.com.

Cheers, and happy slashing.
