Since I'm not seeing many .plans updated recently, I thought I'd update mine. Not that I have anything work related to say.
We've all been sworn to such secrecy that I think we are working on games for the NSA. Or the CIA. Whatever.

Wait, I do have something to ask. I was thinking of extending the C tutorials I wrote to add a another tutorial on writing code
for the Quake III engine. I'd be aiming it at Modders, with some stuff thrown in there about how some of the .exe works too. There
would be some "ahhh, that explains alot" answers in there (hopefully). I'm aiming it at those with no prior knowledge of Quake code
but that do have some idea of 3D, so when I mention a vector they don't go screaming from the room. I have Id behind it, but my
question to you guys out there is "Would this be useful?". I don't really want to spend the time doing this if no one is going to get
anything out of it.

I'm really doing it because I ran out of home projects to do, and since we here at Raven are pretty familir with the Q3 engine, I 
thought this would be a natural extension of the C tutorials. Drop me a line if you would be interested in this.

Nothing much else to say. Normal programming will resume in a moment.
