Looking Glass Gone? What is going on with the world? Bill Gates is going to win the Humanitarian of the year
award next.

Seriously, I personally am extremely sad to see this high quality house close it's doors. Thief was something new
in the FPS genre, and it's a shame that sales weren't as good as they obviously needed to be. I don't think there's
a software house out there that hasn't been in a close situation like that themselves. Raven is no stranger to barely
making ends meet before we became a part of Activision.

While we are on that subject, we would like to extend an offer to those that worked at Looking Glass to send their
resumes to us at Raven, specifically Level Designers and Programmers. We are always on the look out for high quality
people, and if these people haven't shown them selves to be producers of quality then I don't know who has. Send your
stuff either to me, or Mike Crowns at Raven. That's either jsimpson@ravensoft.com or mcrowns@ravensoft.com.
In fact, if you are a programmer anywhere or a Level designer, talk to us. 

On another subject, Mission Impossible 2 sucked out loud. Maybe I'm just not a fan of John Woo movies, but this was
two hours of my life I won't get back. My wife is a huge Tom Cruise fan, enough to have loose morals I suspect, but
even she walked out saying "Well, that was a load of crap". Too many slow motion smoldering glances and ridiculous
acrobatics that were quite un-necessary to the plot. And not even that entertaining either. There are only so many 
occasions that you can really run around with two guns and still actually hit anyone with a gun shot.
