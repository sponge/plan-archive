It's amazing how some really small things can totally turn your perception of the world around.
Last night I was reading the online edition of the Daily Telegraph, and I read that the BBC are planning
a 40 million Doctor Who movie. Well, as anyone that has ever seen my office can testify (Competition of the
week - where does the word Testify come from? I guarantee you'll enjoy finding out) I am the worlds biggest
Doctor Who and Dalek fan. I'm planning on buying one of the 2000 dollar Daleks you can get from This Planet
Earth, just as soon as the wife allows me to. I think I'm going to turn it into a drinks cabinet.
Anyway, back to the point. So this movie is coming. Yay. I'm hearing Sean Bean's name being banded around to
play the Doctor. I don't mind, as long as the actor who plays him is British. There is no way we could have a
Doctor with an American accent any more than we could have an American James Bond.
Man, I wish I was an actor. That would be a great role.
On the other hand, big movie = big games licence! I wonder if I could persuade Activision to dump a couple of
the licences we have for this? Who wouldn't enjoy a Quake 3 engined game, running around with a sonic screwdriver
and zapping Daleks?
