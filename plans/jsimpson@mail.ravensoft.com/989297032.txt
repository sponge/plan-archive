A couple of things. In the VE interview I stated that SOF2 was based off the 1.17 build of Quake III.
Of course I was completely wrong. It's based off the first release of Team Arena. I'm just a dummy getting
confused between Elite Force Multiplayer, which was 1.17, and the SOF2 start up times.
Oh well. What's an interview without something wrong on it?

One other thing. I've been trying to trace a couple of old friends back home in England. I've tried all the
normal places on the web, along with some other tracks and come up dry, so I thought I'd turn to you lot out
there.
The first is an old mate who was in the industry years ago by the name of Paul Jacobs. He's had a varied
career, and I lost track of him about 3 years ago, when he was running a pub somewhere. Paul would be about
45 or so now, tall, very thin, and very smart, with a wicked sense of humor and penchant for Jack Daniels.
Anyone got a clue where he might be? If you do, please, drop me a line.
The second is a lady who was known as Sarah Hooper. God knows what she is now. She'd be ooooh, about 34 or so 
now. She's originally from Strood in Kent, has dark hair and the most amazing smile. Very Sophia Loren like;)
One thing that distinguishes her from everyone else is her love of the Opera, both participating and going to.
She was also in the Kent Youth Choir many many years ago - which is where I met her. Yes, I was in a choir.
Weird but true.
So, if anyone has any leads, do drop me a line at jsimpson@ravensoft.com, I would be forever in your debt.
Thanks.
