July already? What happened to Febuary?

Now that the news about SOF Gold is out of the bag I want to take this opportunity to mention to those out there
that have been sending us bugs on the original SOF release that we have fixed most of these, and you'll see the 
results in GOLD. Some people where a bit upset that the bug fixes didn't make it into 1.05 - here's what happened.
We got word about SOF GOLD happening just when Rick Johnson went on vacation. He didn't have time to split the code, 
and rather than wait a week, we just got on with adding in the new deathmatch modes and bot code. Lots of the bug
fixes we implemented came after this. Given the quantity of code we changed Rick didn't have much chance of just taking
the bug fixes and trying to implementing them in the original 1.04 code base - especially since some of the fixes were
affected by the new stuff that's coming in. A nasty situation here, and one that we couldn't do much about.
1.05 went out without some of the newer fixes in it that we would have like to have seen. 1.05 did fix alot of stuff,
but those bug reports that came in late and from the internet weren't reflected in it.
Gold, however, has everything. And the kitchen sink as well. Well, it feels like it anyway:) As Brian R., our glorious
leader mentioned, there are two new deathmatch modes - both teamplay related. There is a new way of handling team 
selection, bots, new AI and other new stuff. Never let it be said we rest on our laurels.

And best of all, it's FREE:) - well, the update to SOF retail is anyway.
For those that have been holding off buying SOF, here is your reason to rush out and grab it.
