Thanks for the help on the USB problem I had. It turned out that the MS drivers tend to 'slop' a bit when it comes to the USB
bus being flooded. Oh well. The solution was to slap a new USB card into my PC, put the speakers on the board USB and the cam on
the card USB and all is fine and dandy.

I'm going to have a quick rant on the subject of the HandSpring Visor PDA. I bought one of these about 3 months back after doing
some research and I came to the conclusion this was the best item for me. 3 months appears to be the time it takes before the
'indispensable' critical mass is achieved. Now it has my life in it, and of course now is when it starts going on the blink. When
ever I try and use it, the screen flickers. If I shake it at all, the screen flickers. It's incredibly annoying. So I took it back
to Best Buy where I got it - "Do you have your receipt?" "No" "We don't want to know then, talk directly to HandSpring". Great. So
I do, and guess what? Unless you buy your machine directly from Handspring over the web, they don't want to know either. So what am
I to do? I tried contacting people about a repair, but everyone either laughs, or tells me it would cost more to repair it than to
just replace it.

I guess I can't blame Best Buy for their policy - perhaps I should have kept the receipt - but HandSprings behavior is seems deplorable
in this case. I really really wanted to like the Visor - I even bought the 8 meg version - but now it appears I'm left with a defective
machine that is only 3 months old. *sigh*, I guess it's time to look at the Palm 5..

Work wise we are doing lots of stuff. Details to follow at 10.
