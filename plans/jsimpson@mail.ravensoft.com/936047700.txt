A quick update and a request.

Firstly, ATI ROCKS! Wow.. we got some goodies from them today, and I have to say it, some of their new
all-in-wonder cards are pretty sweet. If you ever need to do video capture AND play games, these are the
cards for you!
Secondly - Creative also ROCKS! More goodies from them too... Those new Digital Speakers are awesome. SOF
sounds great on them. Well, they will once we get the properly setup anyway :) Now we just have to persuade
them at Creative to send out those NOMAD mp3 players they were promising at Creativity :)) heheheheh.. can 
you say "Greedy Bastard Techno Lust" ??

Now, onto the request. We've been experiemnting with phoneme analysis for accurate lipsynching on Voyager.
We've played with the MicroSoft Lingustics package, and very cool it is too. Not sure how it is going to work
on other languages but we'll worry about that when the time comes. The question of the moment though is - does
anyone out there have a file format for the .LWV files that this marvellous tool spits out ? I've done some
web searching and come up dry. Anyone out there got these ?
My understanding is that Grim Fandango used this system - anyone from LucasArts out there willing to lend a
little light to this darkness ?

A message to George Broussard. (See ? I spelled it right this time :)) You, my friend, are a way cool individual.
Raven is now a part of the 3D Realms campaign to kill of Jar Jar Binks, and we have the T-Shirts to prove it!

Tip of the day :-
An empty aluminium cigar tube filled with angry wasps makes an inexpensive vibrator.
