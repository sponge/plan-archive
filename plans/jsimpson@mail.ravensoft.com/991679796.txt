I just wanted to congratulate Mucky Foot on going gold with Startopia. I downloaded and played the demo this
weekend, and I can certainly recommend it. A sort of Bablyon 5 meets Silent Running kinda thing. It's certainly
full of those little touches that scream "quality". I especially like the profiles of the aliens, and the little GB
patch on the guy on the initial loading screen. Very cool:)

I have nothing else important to say.
