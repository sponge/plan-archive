Well, I have to update my rant of yesterday regarding my purchase of a Handspring Visor and my experiences at Best Buy
I talked to Best Buy and they did their damndest to help me, but to no avail. Since I used cash to purchase the visor they
have no traceable way of tracking the purchase. And they know their own rules, so Jake is out of luck. Oh well. However, I
also ranted on HandSpring about not allowing me to return my unit to them. Well, it's time to eat some words. After a very 
helpful email from one Todd Brillion of <a href = "http://www.siegerspost.com">The Developers Voice</a> I spoke to Handspring
directly. Well, their people on the phones certainly know what's going on, more than the website does. I'm pleased to report
that not only will they replace my Visor, but they will even pay the shipping. I am impressed to say the least.

It's nice to be able to report something good happening out there in this big world. It's the little things in life that make
the most differences, well, my mother used to say that a lot while looking at my Dad... don't know why.:)

Man, I wish I could talk about what we are doing here at Raven. Until Activision announces what our slate is we (well, I) have
to put off interviews and the like, and it limits what I can talk about here. However, we are pretty excited here over what all
the teams are working on.
