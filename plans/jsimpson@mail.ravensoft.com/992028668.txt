I just updated JakeWorld with a new editorial. I'm trying to get the jakeworld.net domain name I bought
working, but helpfully Network Solutions.com won't let me. Apparently you have to set some option at 
registration time in order to get forwarding to work, and of course, I wasn't aware of this. Do they have
the ability to change this after it's been registered? They do not.
Well done Network Solutions for taking my money yet not allowing me to do what I need. I am most impressed.

I also added a guestbook to Jakeworld as well, and that doesn't work either, requiring permissions to be set
on the server which can't be done until the URL works correctly. Satan farts in my face once again.

In other news, any idea of using Windows XP went right out the window after reading <a href = "http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/19573.html">This</a>

I dunno, is MS just going all out to exclude anyone and everyone from setting things the way they like it,
instead of the way MS would prefer them to? Why is it that MS thinks they know better than I do when it comes
to setting up my PC? At least let me turn all this crap off! And that whole MP3 exclusion thing is just so
transparent it's untrue. I use an MP3 jukebox at home, and there is no way I'm going to stop using it, so MS
just lost one sale right there.
You really know how to make yourself popular there MicroSoft.

Is it just me or those new BlockBuster and 7Up commericals hysterical? Finally humor used in advertising in
the correct manner. Reminds me of the Heineken ads from back home...

As Pat mentioned, we just hit a milestone in our PSx2 game. Maybe it might get announced one of these days:)...
I've got to say, while we've barely started to scratch the surface of the what the PSX2 is capable of, I do 
understand why people think it's hard to develop for. When optimising there are a ton of little fiddly things
you can do, all of which won't make a huge amount of difference by themselves, but when you put them together
can radically affect your frame rate.
However I am fully confident that the technology being produced by our Tech team here of Lead Tech Gil Gribb, 
Marcus Whitlock and Dave Blumenthal will rival anything on the market at release time. Way to go guys.
