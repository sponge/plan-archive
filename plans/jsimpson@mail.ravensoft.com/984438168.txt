A couple of things.
Firstly its been brought to my attention that some people think I was ripping on Tex Atomics Big Battle Bots in the article on gamespot about 
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/features/0,12059,2693475-1,00.html"> Are Graphics Important?"</a>. I just want to point out that the question I posed regarding
what people might think of the colorful nature of TABBB isn't meant as a rip in anyway. I'm genuinely curious about
what the world will make of this game, both for it's visual nature and it's marketing and sales model, which is internet only.
Just wanted to clear that up.

Secondly, I'm on the look out for a graphic novel. I used to own this back in England, but somewhere in the move from the UK to the States, about
10 years ago, it vanished. The novel is called Absolom Dak, Dalek Killer. It's taken from the old Dr. Who monthly comic books from back home.
I've tried Ebay and Yahoo, and got some tame book finders on it, but so far they have come up dry. Anyone out there got one they want to sell?
Any advice is appreciated.
