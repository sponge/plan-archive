I find myself in a stupid situation. Recently software house Dataplus announced they were going to provide an
OpenGL middleware layer for the playstation 2. Now I need to contact these people, but I can't find any reference 
to them on the web, or on any of the news pages out there. Does anyone have a contact there that they could forward
to me? 
Thanks.

On another note I'd like to take this opportunity to say a big Thank You to Brian and Steve Raffel. For those that
aren't aware, the 24th of June is the 10th anniversary of Raven Software. Without Brian and Steve deciding to start
this software house up, I wouldn't have a job. So a big thanks goes to them, as well as a congrats to everyone that
makes this place such a fun place to work.

So what else is new? I appear to have my fingers in many pies at the moment - almost all of which I can't talk about.
It's pretty frustrating on this end, since I tend to use my .plan file to talk about what I'm doing and why, and since 
I can't mention anything, it tends to make for short updates.

For those that are interested I've echoed my C tutorials that I'm doing on my own JakeWorld website. VoodooExtreme gets
them first, but they will appear there soon afterwards.
Also, the last part of the three articles I was doing for Loonygames is also up on my website. The first two, The Anatomy
of a video game and Networking 101 were published, and apparently Looniboi has the third ready to go, but since the site
hasn't been updated in a while I went ahead and stuck the third article up on my site. It's called "Game Philosphy - Make
'em play". It's basically a ramble on thoughts developers should bear in mind when developing titles.
