Are there any well disposed millionaires out there that feel the need to be generous to a poor Game developer?
Cos I found my dream purchase on ebay - <a href = "http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=1129209046"> THIS </a> and there is just no way I can justify
the money. My wife simply said "No" and kept repeating it at 5 minute intervals when I asked again. *sigh*.
I know that This Planet Earth makes them too but a) they are more expensive and b) they don't move around.

On other subjects I finally got around to looking at the Halo movie from GameStock. Wow. This is most impressive.
The FPS aspect of the game didn't look like it was anything astoundingly new, but the vehicles and sheer scope of the 
world is stunning. All that mixing of third person and first person requires some clever camera work, and it looks like
they are pulling it off.
It's very cool and I do look forward to playing this one.

It will only be a few days and I can finally talk about what I've been doing for the past five months. Boy, can't wait
for that!:)
