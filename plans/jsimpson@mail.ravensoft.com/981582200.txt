Does anyone out there know where I might pick up a BUNG GameBoy cart programmer, and a 64meg cart? They used to
offer them on MaderiaGames.com, which is where my good friend Rick Johnson picked up one up before Christmas.
However when I ordered one, they decided they weren't carrying them anymore, and negelected to email me and let me
know, so I've been waiting for it to show up ever since. Way to go MaderiaGames. Needless to say, avoid them if
you can.
Anyway, BUNG it appears has gone out of business, and their new business doesn't look like they carry this most
magical of artifacts.
So I'm resorting to my .plan file and looking through Ebay every now and then.
Anyone else got a lead on one?
Drop me a line at jsimpson@ravensoft.com
Cheers

Addendum:-
Ensemble Rocks. You guys there, Mike McCart and the rest of you know why. 
I am very afraid that all my spare time for the forseeable future just vanished. I Thank you. My wife however, 
is in the midst of employing John Mullins to take you all out:)

One last thing, something personal.
Elliot, RIP. 13 years is long time, but I still remember you, and I still miss you. I wonder what you would have made
of Episode 1?
