I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere, so I thought I'd do so. SOF GOLD has gone gold, and we should be seeing it in stores
sometime soon. Maybe even as soon as this weekend, but no promises there. The patch to upgrade your existing SOF to SOF GOLD
should be around once the product has hit the stores. No exact dates, since there are many factors involved there. Anyway, it's
done, and it's free to those that have already purchased SOF.

What's included?
A real brief list, and this is just what I can pull off the top of my head.

Some AI fixes,
Some sound system fixes - for both EAX and A3D.
Two new deathmatch modes - Control and Conquer the Bunker
New methods of assigning teams - for CTF, Control and Conquer it's now Red/Blue rather than just team based. That was getting
too cumbersome.
Tons of new skins and teams. Guess who from Raven is in there:)
New levels. Not sure how many.
Some download fixes.
And lots of other stuff.

I'm sure Rick Johnson will have a more comprehensive list of what's new later.
