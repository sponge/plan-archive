Thanks for all that emailed me with tips and Info regarding BUNG and their Nintendo programmable cartridge.
Apparently the Japanese giant squashed them because people were using it to copy games. It hadn't even occured
to me people would use it that way, I just want to see a game I'm developing actually run on a Gameboy rather
than the emulator I use. Oh well.

Rod "Voodoo Child" eventually came to my rescue. Thanks Rod. Not quite a name in lights, but the best a mere 
programmer can do:)

As for other things Japanese, get a load of this story <a href = "http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/50/16747.html"> Sega President shows his colors </a>
Now that's what I call taking responsibility. Think we'll see the chiefs at Eidos do that??
