      It's been years since last we've talked. Sit down. Have a drink. Warm your self by the fires emanating from my friend , The Amazing Edward, The Spontaeously Combustible Weasel.  He's from the south side of Seattle and let me tell you what!   ...What...    

Things here are dandy in the land of Sanity. I spend my nights and those brilliant periods in between creating all sorts of lovely magics and sundry feats of pixel prestidigitation.   To keep me company in my tower of arcane experimentation I have filled every corner with very talkative and erudite scholars of the plant world.  They are all kings among their species and have bestowed upon me many great honours and interesting tales of their chloropyhlic friends.  They have even suggested a variety of uses for the magics I create.  I am ever so thankfull for their oxygen giving presence.  Maybe I shall have a party to thank them...  Maybe I'll have that party right this minute!   WHoooooooooo HAAAAAAAAAAAA    PARRRTTY!


WHew...  Party's over.  Man, what a blast,  That ivy sure does know how to boogie.  I think I'll have a scar from that head butt the lichen gave me, and boy where ever did the cinnamon fern learn to limbo like that? I think I'll go lie down now.
