    Octember/ the eggplant week.    

   Oh, callooh  callay!  Oh Frabjuous day!  I have the most frightening of good news.  This Dryadical Dreamer has gone and done something which many of you would call mad.  I have committed my self to the task of living with someone for as long as living  is what we are doing.  I think the contract and pledge is renegotiable after corporeal discontinuance, but we can probably wait see.  No sense in worrying about the stuff that hasn't yet happened..  This sort of insanity seems to happen most often when the only form of expression that will even somewhat hint towards the immense goodness you feel for someone is the thrilling opera of your life.  They get box seats, popcorn, those cool little opera goggles, while you dedicate the show to them.  Now of course this isn't just a one man show.  They have to help out with the sets and maybe a little assistance with the plot here and there..   Help with costume changes will probably be needed on occasion..  We'll have to get some one to work in concessions and hire and usher or two....  anyway, I'm looking forward to this grand adventure.  These two heads are better than one and sometimes you feel like a nut while at other times you just don't.  I'm gettin' hitched and i'll keep you updated.

May the shcwartz be wit' ya!
