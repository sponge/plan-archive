Getting close to Alpha on B2. Everything is looking quite awesome. Eric and Andrew have been pimping out the weapon effects. I think people will appreciate the fact that they won't see the Pyromania CD explosions for once in a game. Sounds for enemies, weapons and IMA are getting checked in left and right, they are utterly incredible. I still like the hind sound from UO tho. =) j/k

My last plan file was titled ".Plan File"
This one is titled ".Plan File 2" and the next will be ".Plan File 3 : The Beginning to an End"

soooo... S.A.F.D.S.M.U.P.A.B.
