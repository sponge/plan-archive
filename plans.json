I guess I'll just pick up where the last visible update\noff.\n\n  Still not smoking, haven't had one in a long time.  Wife is good, though\nnot feeling too well lately.  The highlight of my GDC was playing \nUnreal Tournament 2003.  Game feels great, cool weapons, great feedback!\nI was thinking about it, and I believe I figured out why it is so much\nmore fun for me to play UT2003 than it was for UT.  I worked on UT.  I\nput over a year of my life into it and watched it evolve and grow from a\nbuggy patch on Unreal to a full game in its own right.  I was burnt out\non it before it ever hit store shelves (final testing having a lot to do\nwith that).  This time I get to play a game that I haven't worked on, that\nplays very similar to a game I helped make and found very fun.  Its like\ngetting a surprise present!\n\n Playing Onimusha 2, and having a blast, even if I don't speak or read\nJapanese AT ALL.  I did the same thing with Devil May Cry, though that was\na bunch easier since all the voice work was in English.  So I can't understand\nthe story.  Technology has gotten far enough that I can read the body language\nand expressions of the characters well enough to get the gist of the discussions,\neven if the plot is escaping me.  For me, the plot is fighting a bunch of monsters,\ngetting cooler weapons, sucking souls, and getting to new and cooler places.  In\nthis respect, the game has succeeded!  Not finished with it yet, but I expect\nto be today or tomorrow (I've got 12+ hours in it so far for those who care).\n\n Looking forward to Dungeon Siege!  I ran into Chris Taylor at GDC and had \njust enough time to congratulate him before being whisked away.  A friend\nof mine works at Gas Powered and assures me the game is fun.  She better be\nright :)\n\n - Alan\n\n\n11/14/01\n--------\n\n Just a brief mention of current events in my life...\n\nSometime this month (I think) will mark the 6 month anniversary of my having\nquit smoking.  Most of the other times I have quit I've known to the day how\nlong it's been... but this time I haven't really cared to keep track.  Good\nsign maybe?  Hope so.\n\nOn October 19th, 2001, I got married (to a human female, no less!).\n\nOn September 28th, I bought my first home.\n\nSeptember 19th marked the 3 year anniversary of my moving to Raleigh to\nwork with Epic Games.  I had been hired slightly before then, but that's the\ndate that I moved into my apartment.\n\nThere's the big news in my life, both these events have radically affected\nmy perception of the world (not to mention I was sitting with the\nrealtor in what is now my living room on the morning of the 11th, while the\ninspection of the house was going on, watching events unfold on someone\nelse's television on someone else's couch).\n\nMethinks 2002 is going to be quite interesting.\n\n10/31/01\n--------\n\nHappy Birthday to me, I turn 27 today.\n\nYes, once again its Halloween, my favorite holiday and birthday.\nI wish everyone a safe and totally enjoyable holiday!\n\n - Alan"}, {"by": "alan@epicgames.com", "time": 973550880, "contents": "Login: mobius         \t\t\tName: Alan Willard\nPlan:\n\nLegals would have gone here if I had spent many years\nin college to be a lawyer.

My birthday is tomorrow (yes, my birthday really is Halloween) and\nI've decided that for the very first time, I'm not doing anything, no party, no\ntravelling to see relatives, no cake.  May sound boring, but remember, since I'm\nturning 26, that means I've had 25 birthday parties already, some of them\ninvolving a 16 hour round trip drive back to Birmingham to spend it with my\nparents.  This is much less stressful :)\n\n  In other news, we finally got our real office furniture, which might not sound\nvery exciting to anyone else, but since we've spent the last 2+ years working on\nfolding tables in white rooms (most of us, at least), this is a HUGE change!  \nShane, Cliff and I spent a few days taking our stuff down and painting, so now we\nhave a very nicely appointed office to walk in to every day.

Things are coming together pretty nicely\nand quickly... I don't know when we're going to be finished with it, \nbut the development team is whipping stuff up pretty fast.\n\nGo to www.ritualistic.com for more information, and look for a\nbeta soon!\n\n\n01-22-99\n--------\nTo listen to the cheesy Sin Deathmatch Song type these \ncommands in the console when you are in a level:\n\nsoundtrack rammdm\nmusic normal\n\nSong was written by Zak Belica\nPerformed by The Ritual Crew\nMixed by Zak Belica\n\n11-08-98\n--------\nCrash bug in Sin - Area57 - Mutant Mode\n\nDon't save your game in this level.  Try to complete it \nwithout dying.  This will allow you to transform back \nto human form and continue the game.  If you are having\ntrouble finishing this level, use the health cheat \n( Type \"health 200\" at the console ) to give yourself \na boost.\n\nThere is a bug with savegames and mutant mode, and the\ngame will crash when you receive the antidote to be \ntransformed back to a human.\n\n11-06-98\n--------\n\nPart II\n--------\nResolution changing problem with the menus has been isolated.  960x720\nwas left out of the menu, so all the modes are off by 1 after 800x600.\n\nIf you're so lucky as to be able to run at 1024x768, crank the setting\nover to 1152x864.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n***SIN LOADING TIMES***\n\nIf you want to increase your loading speed for quick saves\ntype these commands at the console before you start a game:\n\ndeveloper 1\nset flushmap 0\n\nThis speeds up \"quick\" loads i.e. when you already have the\nmap loaded.  Dying in the game isn't as painful now :-)\n\nBy setting developer to 1, it will not draw the status bar, so you\nwon't get to see in between level information. This will save you \nabout 20 or so seconds of loading time on just about any map. You \nwill probably also see some warnings printed out since developer\nprovides verbose information about what's going on in the game.\n\n\"flushmap\" was used to explicitly free maps after they are already loaded \nfor development purposes.\n\nThese fixes will be incorporated into the first patch and these commands\nshould help in the meantime.  The status bar has been optimized as to \nnot take up as much time, and flushmap will explicitly be set to 0.\n\n\n10-30-98\n--------\nJust walked into the office this morning to hear that Sin went\n( GM ) Gold Master sometime last night.  I think that the word has been\nsent out to all the news sites.  \n\nWe've all been busting our asses to get this thing finished, and the\nlast few days have been pure hell,  but I think that it will\nall be worth it.  The epsiodes really came together in these last \nfew weeks, and I have to thank all the Sin level designers and\nartists for putting up with all the code thrashing and \nfunctionality changes they had to go through in the last \nmoments. \n\nWe'll probably be writing up a post-mortem on the development of\nthe game, so look for that sometime soon.  \n\nStart looking for Sin in stores sometime next week!\n\n8-20-98\n-------\nMark and I took a break fron Sin coding tonight and played \nMotocross Madness.  Wow.  This game is a LOT of fun!  \nWe spent about an hour trying to jump over the finish \nline's top girder.  It can be done...\n\n8-12-98\n-------\nHappy 2nd birthday to Ritual Entertainment!\n\nI can't wait for the birthday party tonight. \n\n8-6-98\n------\nFirst, I just wanted to say thanks to all the people that sent in \nconstructive and positive comments about Sin.  This is my first\n\"official\" game, so it feels pretty good that the Sin demo gave\npeople a lot of enjoyment.  We're working hard to fix the bugs\nand a few more little things to make the final game even more \nimmersive.\n\nSin Bug Fun:\n------------\nAn interesting bug popped up in one of the deathmatch games I was in\nthe other day.  It happens when a player shoots someone with a rocket,\nthe person who gets hit dies (\"Player died\" gets printed to the console)\nand he loses a frag, and the person who killed em gets nothing.\n\nIt was interesting to see that the rocket blast changed the victim's \nvelocity with a downward momentum, thus pushing him into the ground and\ntriggering the falling damage routine.  So, if you hit someone directly\nwith a rocket doing 97 points of damage the falling damage works out\nto about 7 points which credits the \"ground\" with the frag instead of\nthe shooter :-)  I'm fixing it now...\n\nThanks to the guys that pointed it out to me while I was deathmatching\non their server.\n\nAnybody figured out how to make their own HUD yet???\n\n7-9-98\n------\nJust wanted to add my 2 cents about the Sin scripting video which\nCharlie forgot to mention ;-)\n\nThe computer terminal that is being used to control Danny is also\nfully integrated with the script system so you can design\ncustom menu systems to control your stuff (if it wasn't obvious from the video).\n\n5-12-98\n-------\nIt's been 3 months since my last .plan update, so I guess it's about time \nfor a new one.  \n\nSin Info\n--------\nI've been busy working on interface / 2D things for Sin.  We are now \nfinalizing the way the interface is going to work.  I've taken the layout\ncommands from Quake2 and added about 50 new features.  This will let anyone\ncreate custom interfaces for the game menus and the HUD.\n\nThe layout commands are kind of like a primitive form of HTML, so if you can\nmake a webpage, you probably can create a Sin menu or HUD.  One of the cool\nthings is that everytime I add a new command for the HUD, it can also\nbe used on the in-game consoles.  This lets you put things like the \nplayer's health or name on a 3D screen in the game.\n\nI also had to add some networking stuff to get the multiplayer aspect of \nin-game consoles to work and that took a little bit of time. Most of the time\nwas spent learning how the Quake2 networking system works and fitting in the\nnew baselines/states for consoles.  I didn't think that something as simple as\na console in the game would be so tricky, but I ran into many problems\nwhile designing them.  A lesson to be learned about multiplayer game aspects\nI guess.\n\nOther Stuff\n-----------\nI didn't get to go to CGDC this year, but Gary McTaggart took a bunch of pics\nfor me to re-live the experience.  It just wasn't the same :-(  \n\nUntil next time...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"by": "aldie@ritual.com", "time": 936300000, "contents": "\n*** Ritual Entertainment's Finger Server\n\nUser name: aldie\nPlan modified: Thu Sep 02 16:14:20 1999\n\nScott Alden - Programmer - Ritual Entertainment\nEmail: aldie@ritual.com\n-----------------------\n09-02-99\n--------\nNon-Ritual Entertainment Related\n\nwww.3dgamegeek.com is alive again.

It's pretty cool, \ncheck it out if you get a chance.  The trackball\ntook some getting used to though.  There are Redemption\nbots in the single player game (www.planetquake.com/redemption), \nand there was a second machine there to play 1 on 1 deathmatch.\n\n04-22-99\n--------\nNon-Ritual Info\n---------------\nMe, Jack Mathews, and Rod Hughes ( all formerly of 3Dfx ) have set up a new\n3D gaming news page (www.3dgamegeek.com).  Right now all we do is news, \nbut we have some plans for future geeky stuff.\n\nWe've set up a cool system where you can filter out different categories\nof news articles.  So if you don't want to see any articles of a \nparticular genre/category, one click will hide them away.   There's also\nfilters where you can get lists of articles of a particular category too.\n\nCheck it out if you have a minute and let us know what you think of it.\nYou can email one of us.\n\naldie@3dgamegeek.com \njack@3dgamegeek.com \nrodh@3dgamegeek.com\n\nIf you have news that you want to send in, email it to\nnews@3dgamegeek.com\n\n04-02-99\n--------\nSin 1.04 is out at www.ritualistic.com\n\nThis update contains CTF built in.  Thanks to all\nthose involved who helped make SinCTF a reality.  \n\nGive it a try while you're waiting for that other game.\nThere's a server up at sinctf.ritual.com.\n\nHave Fun!\n\n03-25-99\n--------\nSinCTF Update\n\nThanks to everyone who's been playing and giving feedback to \nthe SinCTF team!  We really appreciate it.\n\nWe're still trying to find one more bug before releasing, and\nwe can't seem to track it down!  Once we figure this one \nout, we should be ready to go with a full release.\n\nWe think that the bug is related to spectators (i.e. those\nwho have not joined a team).  If the server has crashed\nwhile you were a spectator please let us know the situation\nif you could associate it with anything.  Please send \ndetails to sinctf@ritual.com.\n\n\n03-19-99 (part 3)\n-----------------\nNew commands added:\n\ndropflag - Drops the flag, but will quickly return to enemy \nbase if not picked up.\n\ndropweap - Drops your current weapon.\n\n\n03-19-99 (part 2)\n-----------------\nSinCTF Beta 2 is out!\n\nWe're still working on the game code, so this is an update to the \nclient.\n\nHere's the link:\n\nftp://ftp.ritual.com/Sin/CTF/sinctfb2.exe\n\nWe set up two servers that you can connect to:\n\ndebugctf.ritual.com and sinctf.ritual.com\n\nThe debugctf is running under a debugger, so it may be a little \nchoppy.  Please send any bugs to sinctf@ritual.com.  If you\nare easily frustrated by beta software, then don't download\nthis yet.\n\nThanks and have fun!  \n\n03-19-99\n--------\nSinCTF servers at Ritual will be down for a while tonight\nwhile we get SinCTF Beta 2 upgraded and out there.\n\n03-18-99\n--------\nA Few CTF things:\n\n- The servers may go up and down unexpectedly.  This is because they\ncrashed ( oh no! ) or we are making code changes and fixing stuff.\n\n- Here's some useful commands to bind if you didn't see the readme yet:\n\n'droptech' - so you can pick up the best tech rune when you see it, or \ndrop the nasty deathquad.\n\n'messagemode2' - so you can type messages to your team.  'say_team' also works\nfor binding keys to useful messages like \"Base is clear\", etc...\n\n'weaponuse' - this is basically an alternate fire command used for \nfiring a grenade from the chaingun, firing a thrallball from the \nrocket launcher, and zooming the sniper rifle.\n\n\n03-17-99\n--------\nPlease run sinctf.exe when you are running CTF.  Sin.exe\nworks, but you miss out on some stuff.\n\n\n03-16-99\n--------\nSinCTF Beta 1 is out!\n\nThis is a public beta to just help us get the kinks worked out.\nWe've been playtesting in the office for while now and it seems\nto be going pretty good.  We are only releasing the client for\nnow, but the gamedll will be forthcoming so you can setup \nyour own server.\n\nHere's the link:\n\nftp://ftp.ritual.com/Sin/CTF/sinctfb1.exe\n\nWe set up two servers that you can connect to:\n\ndebugctf.ritual.com and sinctf.ritual.com\n\nThe debugctf is running under a debugger, so it may be a little \nchoppy.  Please send any bugs to sinctf@ritual.com.

It is\nreally fun to play and they took advantage of a lot of stuff that we\ndidn't get a chance to use in Sin...\n\nOther Sin news - If you hadn't seen it on www.ritualistic.com yet,\na bunch of us here are Ritual and the Cops and Robbers team are \nco-working on SinCTF.  Things are coming together pretty nicely\nand quickly... I don't know when we're going to be finished with it, \nbut the development team is whipping stuff up pretty fast.\n\nGo to www.ritualistic.com for more information, and look for a\nbeta soon!\n\n\n01-22-99\n--------\nTo listen to the cheesy Sin Deathmatch Song type these \ncommands in the console when you are in a level:\n\nsoundtrack rammdm\nmusic normal\n\nSong was written by Zak Belica\nPerformed by The Ritual Crew\nMixed by Zak Belica\n\n11-08-98\n--------\nCrash bug in Sin - Area57 - Mutant Mode\n\nDon't save your game in this level.  Try to complete it \nwithout dying.  This will allow you to transform back \nto human form and continue the game.  If you are having\ntrouble finishing this level, use the health cheat \n( Type \"health 200\" at the console ) to give yourself \na boost.\n\nThere is a bug with savegames and mutant mode, and the\ngame will crash when you receive the antidote to be \ntransformed back to a human.\n\n11-06-98\n--------\n\nPart II\n--------\nResolution changing problem with the menus has been isolated.  960x720\nwas left out of the menu, so all the modes are off by 1 after 800x600.\n\nIf you're so lucky as to be able to run at 1024x768, crank the setting\nover to 1152x864.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n***SIN LOADING TIMES***\n\nIf you want to increase your loading speed for quick saves\ntype these commands at the console before you start a game:\n\ndeveloper 1\nset flushmap 0\n\nThis speeds up \"quick\" loads i.e. when you already have the\nmap loaded.  Dying in the game isn't as painful now :-)\n\nBy setting developer to 1, it will not draw the status bar, so you\nwon't get to see in between level information. This will save you \nabout 20 or so seconds of loading time on just about any map. You \nwill probably also see some warnings printed out since developer\nprovides verbose information about what's going on in the game.\n\n\"flushmap\" was used to explicitly free maps after they are already loaded \nfor development purposes.\n\nThese fixes will be incorporated into the first patch and these commands\nshould help in the meantime.  The status bar has been optimized as to \nnot take up as much time, and flushmap will explicitly be set to 0.\n\n\n10-30-98\n--------\nJust walked into the office this morning to hear that Sin went\n( GM ) Gold Master sometime last night.  I think that the word has been\nsent out to all the news sites.  \n\nWe've all been busting our asses to get this thing finished, and the\nlast few days have been pure hell,  but I think that it will\nall be worth it.  The epsiodes really came together in these last \nfew weeks, and I have to thank all the Sin level designers and\nartists for putting up with all the code thrashing and \nfunctionality changes they had to go through in the last \nmoments. \n\nWe'll probably be writing up a post-mortem on the development of\nthe game, so look for that sometime soon.  \n\nStart looking for Sin in stores sometime next week!\n\n8-20-98\n-------\nMark and I took a break fron Sin coding tonight and played \nMotocross Madness.  Wow.  This game is a LOT of fun!  \nWe spent about an hour trying to jump over the finish \nline's top girder.  It can be done...\n\n8-12-98\n-------\nHappy 2nd birthday to Ritual Entertainment!\n\nI can't wait for the birthday party tonight. \n\n8-6-98\n------\nFirst, I just wanted to say thanks to all the people that sent in \nconstructive and positive comments about Sin.  This is my first\n\"official\" game, so it feels pretty good that the Sin demo gave\npeople a lot of enjoyment.  We're working hard to fix the bugs\nand a few more little things to make the final game even more \nimmersive.\n\nSin Bug Fun:\n------------\nAn interesting bug popped up in one of the deathmatch games I was in\nthe other day.  It happens when a player shoots someone with a rocket,\nthe person who gets hit dies (\"Player died\" gets printed to the console)\nand he loses a frag, and the person who killed em gets nothing.\n\nIt was interesting to see that the rocket blast changed the victim's \nvelocity with a downward momentum, thus pushing him into the ground and\ntriggering the falling damage routine.  So, if you hit someone directly\nwith a rocket doing 97 points of damage the falling damage works out\nto about 7 points which credits the \"ground\" with the frag instead of\nthe shooter :-)  I'm fixing it now...\n\nThanks to the guys that pointed it out to me while I was deathmatching\non their server.\n\nAnybody figured out how to make their own HUD yet???\n\n7-9-98\n------\nJust wanted to add my 2 cents about the Sin scripting video which\nCharlie forgot to mention ;-)\n\nThe computer terminal that is being used to control Danny is also\nfully integrated with the script system so you can design\ncustom menu systems to control your stuff (if it wasn't obvious from the video).\n\n5-12-98\n-------\nIt's been 3 months since my last .plan update, so I guess it's about time \nfor a new one.  \n\nSin Info\n--------\nI've been busy working on interface / 2D things for Sin.  We are now \nfinalizing the way the interface is going to work.  I've taken the layout\ncommands from Quake2 and added about 50 new features.  This will let anyone\ncreate custom interfaces for the game menus and the HUD.\n\nThe layout commands are kind of like a primitive form of HTML, so if you can\nmake a webpage, you probably can create a Sin menu or HUD.  One of the cool\nthings is that everytime I add a new command for the HUD, it can also\nbe used on the in-game consoles.  This lets you put things like the \nplayer's health or name on a 3D screen in the game.\n\nI also had to add some networking stuff to get the multiplayer aspect of \nin-game consoles to work and that took a little bit of time. Most of the time\nwas spent learning how the Quake2 networking system works and fitting in the\nnew baselines/states for consoles.  I didn't think that something as simple as\na console in the game would be so tricky, but I ran into many problems\nwhile designing them.  A lesson to be learned about multiplayer game aspects\nI guess.\n\nOther Stuff\n-----------\nI didn't get to go to CGDC this year, but Gary McTaggart took a bunch of pics\nfor me to re-live the experience.  It just wasn't the same :-(  \n\nUntil next time...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"by": "aleiby@legendent.com", "time": 1034804040, "contents": "aleiby@legendent.com\nhttp://www.cs.rit.edu/~arl8258\n\nCurrent Project: Unreal 2\n\n// 2002.10.11\n\n** CAMPING F4G0T **\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: James Parkman \nTo: DarkOnesBitches \nSent: Wednesday, October 09, 2002 10:49 PM\nSubject: *SNIPER*\n\n\nThe sniper apparently just shot someone in Manassas...

It's supposed to be a brief story about violence.\n\nAssignment#2\n\nThe lights went out and it was pitch black.  At least two people screamed and several more held their breath, including myself.  Instinctively my handed grabbed a cold metal pipe for security. They would enter the boxcar any second now.  The anticipation was hell.  The air was frozen with tension, just waiting for the slightest motion to shatter it.  I counted my shallow breaths, \nwaiting....waiting.  I wasn't ready for the shock as the boxcar shook on it's tracks and the loud scream of ripping metal filled my ears.  I couldn't move, this was too much for me to handle. \nScreams sounded up and down the length of the compartment.  Then a new sound rose above it \nand I moved.  The primal shriek had me on the feet and into a frantic stumble.  I couldn't even make out shapes in this darkness.  My hands outstretched to guide me, I bounced off a corner and then tripped over a body.  God!  The thing was right behind me!  I heard more of them to my left, howling and snarling with excitement.  Oh God help me!  It caught my leg and I was flung against a nearby wall.  The metal ribs scrapping my flesh as I fell to the floor.  I lay still, my head resting on the cool floor.  The noise passed me and found new delight down the hall.  I \nthink that's the man with the blue hat that I hear now.  I reached down and gently rubbed my leg.  My fingers came back wet.  The whole car was ablaze with insane voices.  My eardrums beckoned for relief.  Someone next to me was crying loudly. \n What do I do now?  Those bastards would make sure we all died tonight.  I have no \nidea what drives them, but they're not going to leave anyone breathing.  A hand grabbed my \narm and I jumped out my skin with a yell.  I was on my feet before I heard her voice.  She \ntugged on my arm, pleading hysterically for help.  Then she was ripped away from me with a vicious pull.  Her nails leaving bloody trials on my arm.  My lungs pounded in a flurry.  Holy shit! I was drenched in a wave of warm, thick liquid as I heard her gurgling cries.  I lost it.  I began to weep and my mind spun in dense circles.  My arms flailed about and drug across the wall.  I felt \na metal rod mounted next to me.  Both my hands latched on.  I was one tense muscle.  I \nordered my whole body to pull.  The pipe let go suddenly and I spun to the floor again.  My trembling hands choked up on the grooved metal and I came up swinging.  In my mind, I could see the wide arcs I was making with each stroke.  Screams of horror surrounded me, tugging my aim in all directions.  I didn't care what I came in contact with.  The pipe struck flesh.  I felt it give a little.  Again!  This time bone.  Faster I swung!  Total fear and panic had taken over me. \nI yelled with all my strength and ran blindly to my left.  I tripped over more bodies and kept running.  Slippery blood flowed down onto my hands and arms.  I tightened my grip and laid into the first loud noise I came to.

I've mentioned this a bit in t=\nhe\npast, but a lot more work has gone into it since then.   When I made maps\nbefore I'd get really annoyed at how hard it was to texture map stuff.  I\nshudder to think about it now, but suffice it to say it was a tedious and\npainstaking process and was the part I looked forward to the least.  That\nsucks for a lot of reasons, texturing is one of the most important parts =\nof\nmaking these maps.  The Geometry can be as cool as it comes, but without\ngood texturing it's not going to matter.  After crying about it and\ncommiserating about it with Ron we were saved.  Martin, one of our kick-a=\nss\ncode monkeys, has been working on the map editor, and he recently\nimplemented a new method of texturing that is slick, easy, and still allo=\nws\nfor the detailed work that our old, tedious, lame system did.  Applying\ntextures is still a long process, but the time it takes seems to have at\nleast been halved now.  That's may more improvement then we'd hoped for s=\no\nwe're totally stoked.  Another cool thing that got added recently involve=\nd\nviewing the map in \"solid\" mode.  If you ever edited quake levels or if\nyou've done some 3D modeling, you probably know what I mean.  I'm not a 3=\nD\nmodeler, but I've created my share of quake maps in the past.  One thing\nthat always annoyed me about solid mode was that you could barely\ndistinguish angles.  In most quake and other fps level editors the solid\nmode has no shading.  Again Martin came to the rescue by adding an option=\n to\nturn on a shading mode that allows you to clearly see each plane and poly=\n of\na piece of world geometry.  I never really thought about how much differe=\nnt\nmakes \"solid\" mode.  It's so much slicker and usable now.  Suffice it to =\nsay\nI feel like a kid who just got exactly what I wanted for my birthday. ;)\n\n  We've been fortunate with our programmers, if you ask me.  They are a\nseriously dedicated group of talented ass-kicking individuals, and I feel\nlucky to be able to work with them.\n\n  On the artwork side of things, we've added a bunch of new animations to\nthe characters that make them feel even more life-like.   Derek Frost, ou=\nr\nArt Director, has been working on enhancing the custom portrait system an=\nd\nman it is looking amazing right now.  I love this point in the developmen=\nt\nof a game because everything clicks together and the game visibly evolves=\n on\na daily basis.  Of course, I'll be changing my tune the next time I have =\nto\nlive in my office for days on end, but hey, that's the way the job works.=\n ;)\n\nI guess that's it for the moment, but let me end this with a question, an=\nd\nit's a weird one=85  How exactly do _you_ think multiplayer will work in =\nthis\ngame?  Obviously I know exactly how it works, but I'm curious as to what =\nyou\nexpect.

It's to people who work in this industry.\n\nWhat really dissappoints me is when I run across articles that attempt to\ndeceive, shift blame, and point fingers in the industry. \n\nI had the chance to write an interview with Lithium at Ritualistic last month\nwhere I recall mentioning how fun it was to work with Romero, how he was\na blast to hang around, etc... at any point in the interview I had the chance\nto bash Ion or John or whomever, but I tend to look at the positive aspects\nin things. What really gets me is when I come across articles in which that\nperson in return rips the credit away from those he worked with, and denies\nwhatever friendship that was once held. This is the quote To which I am \nreferring:\n\n\"MGON: After over half of the Daikatana team left, how has production come along? \nJohn: Really well. I'm very glad they left; we needed to get rid of them. \nNow, we have some very professional guys working for us. \n\nMGON: What caused them to leave? \nJohn: Oh, just a lot of stuff. We had some fired employees get together \nand revolt with them, and stuff like that. It was just a mess. \n\nMGON: How much of the content that the original team produced is \ngoing to make it into the final release? \nJohn: What you're looking at right now has no content from the original team whatsoever. \nWe completely started over. I don't think we would have been able to accomplish \nnearly as much as we have without the new team. It's going to be really kick-ass.\"\n\nI won't argue about John's comment of \"professionalism\", people do what they\nfeel they need to. For me I was sitting around playing around with textures for 8 levels\nover a period of 15 months. I needed more, and rather than sitting around\nfor what would have been now 6+ more months, I chose to work with Ritual where\nmy workload is now seemingly more than I can handle, etc...  there is no scandal,\nthere is no \"story\", its plain and simple. We all seek to improve upon ourselves\nand I did what I felt was necessary. I don't think I was unprofessional about\nleaving, I simply needed to move on.\n\nThe \"Bloodshot\" guys left for their own reasons as well... and professional or not, it would\nbe pretty damned hard to turn down someone offering you your own company on a \nsilver platter. These guys need at least one person fighting in their corner...that \nwas bad timing Dallas Observer...I firmly believe the Bloodshot guys didn't have anything \nto do with that.\n\nBut John, blatantly stating that the game has no content from the original team whatsoever?\nI do admit that I see some new content, but I would take a very educated guess that\nover 80-90 percent of the assets I saw were done by the original team. I recognized\nthe future DM level, as being a slight modification of Dabugs level, with almost all\nof Andy Chang's textures. Gibbler on the roof was completely new, and most\nof those textures were there when I left...used haphazard and random though...\nHiro still looked very Ken-esque though his colors may have been changed. \n(sigh)... that my \"stand-up for someone\" deed for the month.\n\n...anyways, most people in this industry are actually very nice people... many who\nlove to make games, even John Romero. I just wish we could talk about our games\nwithout trying to hurt others in the process... I wish Ion all the luck with Daikatana, \nand I hope Bloodshot makes a kickass wacky Kiss game...and I want them to want to play\nHeavy Metal ;) \n\nIt's times like these when drugs should be legalized... One big bag of weed could ease the \ntension between companies with sordid pasts. So toke up, because at e3 we are\nall going to get together and have a big group hug.\n\nOh yeah...and for those of you who think this is some wierd anti-Ion thing grow-up. Ion\ncould use a few people rallying in their corner. They've got a lot of good guys there as well\nso why don't you guys (you know who you are) just ease off a little. They've had a pretty\nbad \"uncalled for\" beating. Orson Wells fooled thousands with his Mars attack scare...\nit's not as bad as people want to believe. \n\nand John, gl with Daikatana, ... just play nice.\n\nthat includes you hungry press mongrels too... let's all try to be professionals.\n\n*andrew puts on his flame-resistant suit and awaits the onslaught*\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n"}, {"by": "andyh@3drealms.com", "time": 1007511480, "contents": "Account Name:  Andy Hanson\nEmail address: andyh@finger.3drealms.com"}, {"by": "anthony@nihilistic.com", "time": 899235300, "contents": "Nihilistic Software\nwww.nihilistic.com\n\nUser Name.........Anthony\nFull Name.........Anthony Chiang\nDescription.......Artist / Intergrator\nLast NT Logon.....Tuesday, June 30, 1998 at 12:06\n"}, {"by": "anthony@nihilistic.com", "time": 944616180, "contents": "Nihilistic Software\nwww.nihilistic.com\n\nUser Name.........Anthony\nFull Name.........Anthony Chiang\nDescription.......Artist / Integrator\nLast NT Logon.....Tuesday, December 07, 1999 at 10:17\n\n12/07/99\n\nIn appreciation...\n\nToday, Hasbro announced that they are shutting down their MicroProse studio\nin Alameda, California. The Alameda Studio was at one time know as Spectrum\nHoloByte and in the late 80's and early 90's, they were among the most\ninnovative software developers. In late 1986, they produced Falcon for the\nMacintosh which was THE killer game app for the Mac. Engineers at Apple\nrushed to contact Spectrum HoloByte and made changes to the OS to just get\nFalcon to run on the entire Macintosh line.\n\nIn 1988, Spectrum HoloByte was the company that brought Tetris to America.\nThis classic was marketed as the first game from the Soviet Union to be\npublished in the US. A year later, Nintendo would follow Spectrum HoloByte's\nlead and include Tetris with their new handheld game system called the\nGameBoy.\n\nThen in late 1991, Falcon 3 for the PC was released. This was the first\ngame to support multiplayer LAN play. I had the privilage of working on\nFalcon 3 and all the following add-ons. It was the most difficult and the\nmost gratifying project I've been associated with.\n\nAfter a change of ownership in 1992, Spectrum HoloByte was infused with\na large amount of venture capital. They used those assets to purchase\nMicroProse, the company founded by Bill Stealey and Sid Meier. With the\nrapid growth of the company came a loss of focus. The managers who were\nbrought in to run the company were far more interested in maximizing their\nstock options than creating innovative products.\n\nQuality CD-ROM titles like \"Star Trek: The Next Generation - A Final Unity\"\nand \"Top Gun: Fire At Will!\" came out in 1995 and 1996 in spite of the inept\nmanagement. But poor management and company politics started to sap the\ncreative energy.\n\nIn 1998, Hasbro purchased all of MicroProse. While the Hunt Valley studio\nremains operational, the doors in Alameda will be closed on January 17th,\n2000. I would like to thank all the friends I've met at Spectrum HoloByte\nwhom I've worked with and let them know that together, we did some pretty\ncool games in the past.\n\n\n\n(File last updated on Tue 07 Dec 1999 at 19:11)"}, {"by": "ataylor@legendent.com", "time": 983546760, "contents": "Andy Taylor\nTechnical Lead and Chief Idiot: Classified\n\n\nMar 2 2001\n\nA small XBox news flash...\n\nI really like the box and the dev-kit software so far. I have stuff running on the XBox that would have taken months on the PS2. Well done MS I say... they certainly seem to have sorted things out development wise. This all from a man who in the past has not been a strong advocate of Microsoft ;-)\n\nIn terms of stability, I can't fault the machine either, (a change for MS right!?) I've left demos running for 3 days solid without a single crash, stutter or problem.\n\nCheese of the day: East European Aluminium Extrusion Plant.\n\n---\n\nFeb 26 2001\n\nWell, much has happened since my last update. It's been a trying time, hence my silence. We've been taken over by Infogrames since my last update, so big changes all around there. We've also been through three new game design proposals since RuneMaster, each one of them have been turned down.\n\nFinally, I have a project however. I can't give out any details officially as yet, but it's an XBox title. I've been working with the XBox now for a few weeks now and it's a cool machine; plenty of power and easy to program thanks to its DX 8 implementation. Over the coming months I'll try to update more with our XBox progress, (as I deftly tip-toe though our NDA agreement ;-)\n\nBy the way it was my birthday on Friday, so please send me lots of cake. I'm now 6 1/2 years old now.\n\nCheese of the day: Swiss.\n\n---\n\nApr 10 2000\n\nMucho mucho good stuff happened since I last updated. GDC was pretty much a drag... some interesting stuff, but on\nthe whole pretty much a big advert for middleware and engine producers.\n\nJust got back from the Sony DevCon 2000. Lots of good stuff there, programming tips, middleware producers. There are\na lot of clever people out there doing lots of clever stuff on PS2. Saw some amazing demo's, especially in the realm of\nreal-time landscapes and shadow systems.\n\nCheese of the day: Haddock.\n\n---\n\nFeb 23 2000\n\nHad a day trip out to Epic the other day to see what they're up to on PS2. They've been working very hard. We saw\nalmost the full version of UT running, (somewhat slowly - but running), and they've done it in just 7 weeks! I can't\nmention many details in fear of being smitten by the big bad Sony, but it's look very good.\n\nWelcome Mike Baldwin!!! RuneMaster is now officially a 3 person team. Mike will be helping out on the engine, before\ngoing onto full game development. He's primarily going to be delving into Maya and writing our export tools. We're\nalso interviewing for our art lead at the moment, so at the last the projects on it's way.\n\nCheese of the day: Cheddar.\n\n---\n\nFeb 10 2000\n\nJust got back from a great, (but exhausting), two-day meeting with the engine team in Salt Lake. We're going to produce\nsuch a kick-ass engine for PS2! The team has some really good ideas for the engine, we should be able to produce some\nvery good looking games.\n\nCheese of the day: Brie.\n\n---\n\nFeb 4 2000\n\nWe have a programming/3D applicant coming in a few minutes. I'm hoping he'll fit the bill and we can finally start \nmoving forward on our game engine. We have big plans in-store for the engine, things that people haven't ever seen,\n(on console or PC).

Kevin sent the tribe a case of the limited \"Blood Splattered\" F.A.K.K.2 Action figure, cause he loves us. =) This is the first of many action figures that will be coming out with the movie. The outstanding detail and Japanese style on this sculpture makes me crazy with anticipation for the complete set. \n\nKaiyodo, the toy house, (http://www.kaiyodo.co.jp/) did a wonderful job! I can't wait to get my hands on the figures based off our game's characters. I must have more toys!\n\nIf you are into action figures and what to see exactly what the heck I'm talking about, go to http://www.heavy-metal.net/ follow the \"Get Cool Stuff\" button to the \"Heavy Metal Stuff\" link. There you can see and buy a ton of F.A.K.K.2 goodies, including the action figure #1.\n\n2. It felt like Christmas, another box came in yesterday, and it was full of The October 1 1999 issue of \"Femme Fatales.\" On the cover was non-other than F.A.K.K.2 (Julie Strain), but it did not stop there. Inside I found 25 pages of photos, painting, never before seen movie stills and one of the coolest articles written from the perspective of the star in the new film, Julie Strain, and the man behind the story Kevin Eastman.\n\nThis woman is the bomb!!! A company could not ask for a better personality to be the inspiration for the lead character in an action game. I want you to go buy this magazine today, here's a taste of what you're going to find:\n\nFirst sentence, which I think describes the F.A.K.K.2 character to a tee, \"An ass-kicker with a heart of gold.\"\n\nNext, \"I'm an entity, a full-busted bitch Barbarella. I'd rather be sexy and look good, than be a great actress, and look like that chick in FARGO.\" =)\n\nOne more, \"Tits for Jesus!! That's my motto.\"\n\nI love this woman!!!\n\n3. The Heavy Metal movie issue should be on the newsstands now. It has a 50 page comic based off of the movie illustrated by the man himself, Simon Bisley. Plus, 20+ pages of never before seen movie art and concept work by Kevin and Biz. Great stuff. It's adult in nature; so don't let your parents catch you with in the bathroom.\n\n4. We are getting ready for ECTS and for a few weeks will be lifting the news blackout. We have not released any screenshots of the game since E3. So for the last couple days, I've been getting together some fresh in-game shots. We've been working hard to make this product fun as well as visually stunning. I hope that you dig them the most. \n\nBackSlider\n\n\nAugust 18, 1999\n\nMy parents are in town and last night I played a VHS copy of the Heavy Metal trailer that was produced for E3. This was the first time that they had seen the game. After view the video, the only response was, \"we still don't understand *exactly* what it is you do?\" \n\nThis morning my mom cornered me, and out of the blue, seriously says, \"I always prayed that you would do Christian work, not the work of the Devil.\" \n\nTrying to stay away from a debate, I answer, \"'Devil's work', what do you mean 'Devil's work?'\"\n\nMom, looking at me the way only a mom can, response, \"I think you know what I'm talking about.\"\n\nSo is the life of a BackSlider...\n\n\nAugust 12, 1999\n\nIt was 3 years ago today that Michael, Mark, Jim, Levelord, and myself quit our jobs at 3D Realms, walked into id's offices (with the biggest grin on our faces) and signed a contract to develop \"Quake Mission Pack 1: Scourge of Armagon.\" A few days later, Tom and Harry joined us and our little company was on its way. \n\nThere are no words that can describe the emotions I felt those first days. Fast-forward three years over a mountain of life, and I still don't have the vocabulary to express the depths of enjoyment received from this experience.\n\nGuys, thank you very much for letting my family and me share this precious journey, may it never end. I'm very proud to have you as my partners and best friends; together we will do great things.\n\n\"I love you man!\"\n\n\nAugust 11, 1999\n\nI LOVE Q3 dm!!!

As far as I see it, playing team means I have half as many targets to shoot at, no thanks.\n\nBackSlider\n\n\nAugust 9, 1999\n\nHeavy Metal 2d job update:\nWe are currently *still* looking for a 2d artist the likes of the pixel-master Adrian Carmack. =)\n \nThere have been a great number of talented artists who have sent art in response to the first time that we posted this position. For the most part, we have been very impressed with their work and have even done a bit of interviewing, but the one thing missing in most portfolios is a health set of high quality game tiles and skins.  \n\nThis is nothing new; game companies have this problem every time they try to find someone to create tiles and skins.\n\nIn the past, the way we have handled this problem is by giving certain interested candidates an \"art-test.\" No reason to freak out, it's super simple! We give you example tiles to look at for quality. Then your objective is to create your own tile set to submit for review. \n\nTo be perfectly honest, I really never look forward to go through this process. However, looking back, I should have prepared the \"art-test\" the first time I announced the job opening. Every 2d artist ever hired at Ritual has completed the \"art-test\" before we even looked at any of his or her other art.\n\nIf you have never created game tiles, this is the perfect exercise to see if you got what it takes. Plus for those artist that are just coming out of school or those trying to make a career changes, 'with no real tile\\skin experience', this the type of specific \"game\" art samples that companies like Ritual are looking for. So, even if you don't get hired at Ritual, after completing the test, you now have a great new portfolio sample to submit the next time you apply at your favorite game company.\n\nGo here http://www.ritual.com/files/arttest.zip and download the zipped file, unzip it, read the doc and check out the art samples. Next, get to creating a sample tile set that even mom would be proud of, then send it to roba@ritual.com.\n\nAfter you take a look at the files and doc, and still have questions just mail. I get back to you ASAP.\n\n\nAugust 6, 1999\n\nHeavy Metal press stuff:\nA few updates ago, I mentioned that there was going to be a huge 'kickass' article about the Dallas gaming community in the Houston Chronicle. Well, Tricia, the author (did I mention she is fine?) emailed me. Anyway, the word is the story runs in the paper today! YEA!\n\nThere will be something for everyone; she talked to just about every Dallas developer including Ritual Entertainment. Plus there will be some cool new art from the different games in development from local companies who participated. Lots of cool stuff! \n\nSo if you are into games and stuff, go to your local newsstand and buy Friday's Houston Chronicle. The article will be in the tech section and\\or if you can't wait go read it online at www.chron.com OR www.mercenarystudios.com (In Missions section - \"Taking Root in Dallas\"). \n\nI would still plan on getting a few copies of the printed paper, because there will be some gameart not available anywhere else. \n\nBTW- The second site, Mercenary Studios, is a new tech\\game news site that Tricia just started. I'm trying my best to get her to upload some *more revealing* pics of herself to the site. Send her some mail tharris@mercenarystudios.com, maybe you can be more persuasive than I have been. Nothing wrong with a little skin with your daily game news. Be creative (not crude) with the \"subject\" field, make it something like \"can we see your butt?\"    =)\n\nAlso press related, ZDTV has a great Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.2 interview \\ preview http://www.zdnet.com/zdtv/gamespottv/videofeatures/story/0,3776,2300862,00.html , with a bunch of the team and Kevin Eastman. Today is the first day that I was able to get the Real player to actually run the damn thing, but it is diffidently worth the wait. In the interview you get your first chance to see and hear the Eastman speak about the Heavy Metal title. For those lucky ones who get ZDTV, they are running this thing all of the time. A must see!!!\n\nOnly thing not so cool, is that the game footage has the old Julie model and animations (show taped at E3). All I can say is that the NEW model and all NEW animations (not seen in video) are so sweet! We literally can't stop looking at her ass. It's a third-person game that may have something to do with it. =)\n\n\nJuly 27, 1999\n\nWe are looking for a \"professional' 2d artist with game development experience to work on Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.2. If you want to work with some of the coolest and most talented guys in the industry on one of the wildest games ever, then get over to http://www.ritual.com/inside_ritual/help_wanted_2d_artist.html for the details.\n\nIt would be ideal to get someone here no later than the first of September. So, if you are in a contract or obligation that you are unwilling to break free of, I understand, we can't wait.\n\nWith the changes of sounding like a real dick - if you are straight out of school and without professional game development experience, chances are you are not going to have the skills we are looking for, so please don't send me your work unless you meet the criteria.\n\nThanks for understanding.\n\nJuly 14, 1999\n\nDarrin pointed this little bit of news out, \"Court TV has signed Martin Sheen to host its one-hour documentary \"Virus of Violence,\" which examines how children can be desensitized by media violence.\"\n\nYours truly, against the better judgment of everyone I know, got sweet-talked into taking part of this documentary. I play the part of the 'defensive' game developer \\ caring father, who defends his industry in the wake of backlash from the resent wave of school shootings.

However, after the Washington Post article, \"Click Bang It's only a Game,\" I'm still very gun-shy (excuse the pun) when it comes to journalist.\n\n\"Virus of Violence\" will premiere in the near future during Court TV's 10p.m. umbrella show called \"Crime Stories.\" I think it's going to air August 14, but these things do change. As the time draws near, I'll let ya know, then we can all watch to see if they give the topic the fair unbiased coverage that it deserves.\n\nhttp://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/re/story.html?s=v/nm/19990714/re/television_sheen_1.html\n\nSpeaking of journalist, Scott Miller (3D Realms) read my update about Softdisk and mailed to reminded me about this super-fly article coming soon in the Houston Chronicle that will cover the birth and rise of the Dallas gaming\ncommunity. \n\nThe writer, Tricia Serju-Harris, came up to BigD and spent time with each of the local developers researching the subject. (One of the best experiences we've ever had working with a professional writer outside of the gaming media.) \n\nSide note, it might not be P.C. to say, but this sister is sooo \"fine!\" Also, she did some serious partying with the Dallas crew. I think she is Jamaican, so you know she can hang. Don't worry Tricia, we'll burn the photos, right after the article comes out. ;)\n\nAnyway, I heard that Scott made this diagram which depicts the family-tree of the Dallas gaming community. I can't wait to see it, and too read the article.\n\nAlso, he reminded me of a few more names that I forgot to add to the Softdisk \\ Shreveport industry connection: Greg Malone (producer of Duke Nukem 3D), Keith Schuler (3D Realms), and Scott Miller, before starting Apogee, had about 10 of his games published through Softdisk. Also, not sure of his name, but the lead designer of \"Redneck Rampage\" is from Shreveport. \n\nThere you have it, more unless information.\n\n\nJuly 13, 1999\n\n(for those who are into trivial history and such)\n\nI was in Shreveport Louisiana this weekend to pick up my boys from the grandparents. For those new to the industry that have never heard of Shreveport, well it's only the \"center of the universe\". =) At least when it comes to PC gaming. \n\nYou see everything has an origin and PC gaming's started, in Shreveport, at this little company named Softdisk Publishing. Softdisk created a subscription disk, which included about five new programs in the mail each month, plus other features such as clip art, puzzles, fonts, sounds, articles, and games. In the early 90's this little company was the only computer software publisher in Shreveport, little did anyone know what was about to happen.\n\nSomething magical was amiss, the planets aligned and in September of 1990 while working at Softdisk four would-be-gods John Carmack, Adrian Carmack, John Romero, and Tom Hall created the first game in the Commander Keen series, Invasion of the Vorticons. \n\nOne month after Commander Keen was released, John Carmack, Adrian Carmack, Tom Hall and John Romero, with the encouragement of Scott Miller (Apogee), left their low paying jobs at Softdisk and officially began id Software.\n\nWe all know the coolass history of id Software, but as for Softdisk, you would have thought that after loosing the arguably the greatest gaming company in the history of gaming they would have been destroyed. Well, they were not, their focus was not about making games, matter a fact the management never saw games as something that important and at the time not many others did either. Face it, what did we have worth a shit on the PC to play before id started making games? \n\nWell I found out this weekend that after the best part of a decade (after loosing id) Softdisk is finally closing their doors for good. I can't let this opportunity pass without thanking the person that hired those guys and placed them in a small room together with one mission in mind - make cool games.\n\nNow that I dusted off the name Softdisk off in this plan for the trivia geeks, it's time to place it back into the micro-fish of PC gaming history once again.\n\n-------------------\nThere are other gaming industry good old boys(gals) of note that got their start at Softdisk or from Shreveport: Kevin Cloud (id Software), Michael Hadwin (Ritual Entertainment), Mike Wilson (Gathering of Developers), Steven Mains (Rogue Entertainment), Jay Wilbur (id Software\\Epic MegaGames), Mike Maynard (Third Law), Rich Vos (Gathering of Developers), William Haskins (Ion Storm), Jen Emert (Ion Storm), Mark Rein (Epic MegaGames), Lane Roth (company?) and of course me (Ritual Entertainment).\n------------------\n\nBTW- Saw Toadies Friday night at the taste, they ROCK! If they come to your town, go see them.\n\n\nJuly 7, 1999\n\nI was feeling a bit guilty about the plan update earlier today not having any \"real\" gaming news...then I picked up a copy of MCV. This rag is cool, covers mostly entertainment business, not really something that the average consumer is going to be reading, but I find it's very informative.\n\nAnyway, on page 18 (June 18, 1999) a picture in the \"feature\" section caught my eye. Everyone in the industry and most fans for that matter have felt some serious heat from the aftermath of the latest high-school shootings. \n\nThe action game makers are still on the hot seat from law makers like Liberman, and individuals like Grossman who honestly feel in their hearts that our products are to blame? \n\nWith all of these lawsuits and the reformers wildly swinging their razor sharp swords of self-righteousness around ready to lop anyone's head off who dares stand up for the most basic of all constitutional rights \"self expression\", who is the marketing genius at Hasbro who thinks this is the right time to introduce an actual electronic handgun with a kids computer game? \n\nGood luck with this line of kid's products, when Grossman sees this you'll need it.\n\nYou got more balls than anyone does in our genre. If the good folks at Xatrix would have tried that \"motherfucking shit\" by including an electronic handgun with the game, I doubt if EB would have even carried Kingpin (great game BTW). \n\nMaybe Xatrix can team up with the folks at Hasbro to come out with KingpinJr PlaySets, fo the little \"motherfucker\" in all of us.\n\nhttp://3dgamegeek.com/viewimage.php3?title=atkins/kidgun\n\nThanks Jack for the link to the pic.\n\nJuly 7, 1999\n\nPimp daddy Hadwin sent a mail that most of this info came from:\n\nThe \"Taste of Dallas\" is this weekend (Jul 9-11) in the WestEnd that's where the Ritual offices are located near. For those of you not familiar with this event, it's the largest free out-door event in Dallas. It involves tasty food from local restaurants, groovin' music from live bands, more Beer than you can shake a stick at, and freaky people watching of all kinds. It's hotter than hell in Texas right now, so that means the babes are going to be wearing next to nothin'. Spread some sauce on that ass give me some cornbread, cause I'm hungry.\n\n(smacking myself across the face) Where was I? Oyea, some of the cool bands playing, fo free, this year are The Toadies, Brave Combo, Trout Fishing in America and others. For those in the know, the Toadies are a kick ass local band that made it big. They'll be playing Friday.\n\nAnyway, if you're in town, make sure to get down to the WestEnd and the Taste. If you see a bunch of dorks wearing Sin paraphernalia, it's most likely the Ritual tribe, stop by and say hi or better yet buy us some beer.\n\n\nJuly 2, 1999\n\nJust got the August issue of Computer Gaming World today. They have a special section named \"CGW's Top 20 Games of E3.\" The gods at CGW were impressed enough to name Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.2 as one of the 'best of the best.'\n\nHere's a taste of what to expect on page 33, \"the heat waves radiating from Ritual Entertainment's motor home at E3 weren't from the sun but rather from the scorching graphics of F.A.K.K.2....\" \"The game has come a long way since we previewed it in our May issue, and we think it'll be one of the hottest for 2000.\"\n\nWoW! That's cool stuff. I'm so proud. :)\n\nAlso, on page 80 they have a special article about 'insider game tips' in titled \"CAUTION: Developers at Play.\" There's like this guy named like the Levelord(tm) and stuff, talking about games and stuff. This leveldude is like everywhere.\n\nThat's it. \n\nHave a great 4th and try not to blow off any fingers with fireworks, you'll needed um for deathmatch.\n\n\n\nJune 29, 1999\n\nWhat's the deal with some cops? \n\nFrom a little situation that involved one of Garland Texas' finest, during a 'routine' traffic stop that happened on our (Darrin and I carpool) way home, from the office.\n\nAs we past 2 cops "}, {"by": "batfink@lith.com", "time": 910199160, "contents": "Login: batfink        \t\t\tName: Toby Gladwell\nDirectory: /home/batfink            \tShell: /bin/bash\nNever logged in.\nNo mail.\nPlan:\n9/16/98\n\nMorning All !! A little update along with a cup of cawfee. Just finishing up some last things on Gruntz, mainly AI tweaks and some last Battlez thingz to make sure we have a tight game. For anyone who's wondering, Battlez is a you-vs-computer style game and differs somewhat from the single player. It has some elements of RTS's but without the usual build-everything-and-wait-and-wait-and-then-attack. Just create some gruntz and go attack someone. If it were just that simple. Hmmm, now I've run out of goo and where the hell is my goober strawz grunt ? Damn, he just got taken out by that gunhatz who gave my swordz a bloody babywalkerz...... :) All in all it's been a lot of fun working on Battlez, although I have to admit that getting beaten by your own AI is rather embarrasing... :P\n\n\nOn other notes, Shogo is done and it looks AWESOME. Big Mechs, Big Guns, Big Sounds, Big Story, this game is BIG !!! Shouts out to the Shogo team for doing an incredible job.\n\nGo Gruntz !! Go Shogo !! Go Blood II !!\n\nL8R\n\n- Fink\n\n\n9/6/98\n\nAll was night and nothing stirred. Except some gruntz. Lots and lots of gruntz. I see gruntz in my dreams now. Running all over the place playing around with...... Well, here we are close to the end of the project and I'm finishing up some last AI taskz and squashing dem bugz. Multiplayer/Battlez has really shone over the last few weeks and I'm sure it will be received well. \n\nThere seems to be a neverending stream of different strategies popping up in multiplayer. I'll bust down Brian with the phat Welderz/Toy combo (kudos to Kev for that one) and then finish up with my wingz move with the special fried rice. There is nothing better than hearing the low moan of 'oh no' over the speakerphone as Bri's gruntz blow themselves to bits.\n\nDoing the AI (and writing a fast pathfinder) has been a rather cool experience. The gruntz themselves have to deal with more than the regular RTS would normally have. Bridges, switches, holez and a variety of semi-puzzles make for an interesting piece of code.\n\nAll of this of course would not have possible without 'wu-wah-woa-woa-wu-wah' which roughly turns out to be a cut from a low fidelity crew remix of a certain funky track out right now. :)\n\n- Fink\n\n\n4/20/98\n\nLetz see. What's been happening lately.. Well, Gruntz is coming along swimmingly with lotz of cool stuff (mental note - remember to go back to using 's' instead of 'z' at end of project..). Weather's good making for some mighty fine riding weather. Out there on the street bustin some phat knee dragging corners (straight through my jeans, skin and bone). I have to remember not to use words like 'dude', 'phat', 'fly' etc... (I'm British). I've been out here too long, it's getting a hold of me.. AGGGGHHHHHH. Anyway, I'm sure there are some readers that like stuff like Red Dwarf, pickled onions, crumpets, fags(yep - fags, try figure that one out and I'm not talking about the American version) and beer that you can't see thru... I must say tho it's nice when I hear someone yell 'bloody hell'. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.. Well, time to get back to work and jam to track 9 on the propellerheads CD DECKSANDDRUMSANDROCKANDROLL. Oh yes, for anyone into techno check out http://www.propellerheads.se and download Rebirth RB-338. It's a dual 303 with a drum machine. Pretty damn cool.\n\nJolly good show chaps...\n\nBatfink\n\n\n3/8/98\n\nIt's been a long time since I posted anything but there is something that I have been thinking about recently (in fact for quite a long time)... I'm wondering what it would take to have all the major 3D hardware manufacturers add a couple of simple things to their current implementations. Everyone's starting to rave and rant about how the next wave of chipsets will have geometry processing on board the chip. Great. I just wish that they would finish rasterization first. What I would love to see (and call me crazy if you like) is.... perspective correct gouraud shading. Most people have probably seen the visual artificats caused by clipping gouraud shaded polygons, it looks awful (but chipset manufacturers obviously think this is okay) not to mention those long polygons that stretch out into the distance. Why or why then does gouraud shading still suck ? How long will it be before we have a chipset that will do perspective shading ? How much effort would be needed to get people to listen ?  Is my argument petty ? well maybe but I think that there is still a considerable way to go before rasterization is taken care of.... let me know what you all think.. (batfink@lith.com)\n\n\n8/27/97\n\n           Batfink sez - lets talk muzak.. I went up to Tower\nRecords last night and bought two of the best CD's that\nI've heard in a long time. They are - 'Vegas' by The Crystal\nMethod (very chem's esque) and 'The Analogue Theater' by C.J. Bolland. Anyone who is remotely interested or into techno HAS to go and get these two CD's. They are quite simply AWESOME. Over the last few months (or is it years) my office has turned into the local niteclub as far as techno is concerned. Over the years I know there have been many converts here at monolith from **other music** to techno. All I need now is one of those funky spinning disco balls and I'll be good to go. Party at party@lith.com.\n\n          The formatting of my plan is probably all out of\nwhack (again). Spen came in and explained it all but it\nseems like I have already forgotten. There's nothing quite\nlike disjointed paragraphs and text that flies all over the \nplace.\n\n          Onto work stuff, there is some very trip stuff going on here right now like Blood II. It's looking real nice. The team\nis busting ass to create some awesome visuals and killer\ngame play. Lots of other cool stuff is going on right now\nwith a few new projects starting up that venture into lands\nunknown.. Who know's what lurks within the belly of the\ncreature known as Monolith ?? (well, I do and a few others !!).\n\n          And so, this wraps up another edition of the Batfink editorial. Adieu to you and you..          \n\n\n8/13/97\n\n         Oh my, It looks like our little quake bet is starting to escalate somewhat. Could it end up something like this - Craig VS Thresh at the MGM Grand ?? Would thresh get so angry as to bite a chunk out of Craig's ear???? who knows....                                                                                                                                                                                     Well, amidst zooming around on my bike and getting  some sun, our *secret* project (mine and schlegel's) is crusing along. Part one of it will be done relatively shortly and released to the unsuspecting world. It's pretty late right now and crunch time is upon us. No sleep. No food. No other-stuff. Much caffeine.. In fact, the last relaxation I had was last sunday at seafair (for you non seattle-ites, seafair is a big event where zillions of boats go out on lake Washington, everyone watches the blue angels then parties like crazy). It was absolutely crazy out there on the lake, I can't actually remember how much beer we all ended up drinking but judging by the state of everyone when we got back, I think we all had fun. The day ended we only a few small accidents occuring which absolutely amazed me. We nearly ran some kid over on the water and  also accidentally wandered out into one of the hydro-plane exit lanes. The cops started shouting pretty loud.. I wonder why??                                                                                                        Played the latest build of the plasma pak tonight, -- AWESOME --, improving on  blood seemed like a tough task but once again our crack-commando squad of cool dudez and dudettes busted out the good stuff..                                                                                                                          Schlegel just wandered in and pointed me to a pretty funny story on www.ogr.com. I guess some dude killed Lord British in Ultima Online (a supposedly impossible task). You should take a look, it's pretty funny ( http://www.ogr.com ).                                                                                                                                                                    So, until we meet again, the is Batfink signing off for the night..\n\nTake care.. :)\n \n\n\n8/5/97\n\nMy wings are like a shield of steel..... For all you folks out there who know what I'm talking about, meet me in half an hour for a few brewski's and some nostalgia.                                  Back to reality - Hello, I'm Toby Gladwell (AKA Batfink), a VP here at Monolith and one of the founders of the company. My first plan update is going to be pretty short, as it's rather late (or early depending on how you look at it). First of, I must complement the web doodz on the ease of use of the plan file system, There I was expecting to have to use a mass of html utilities to try and create something halfway ledgible and instead I get something totally easy to use. Cool.\n         I guess a brief background is in order. I'm from the UK and got into puters at an early age (been through the whole thing - Acorn, C64, Atari ST, Amiga, PC) and took up coding. My forte is in graphics (2D / 3D) which I have always had a passion for. That talent helped us (me and the other founders) get Monolith of the ground (some of you may have seen the RAGE engine demo... That was me - No flames please :). Since then (that was over 2 years ago) alot of hard work, sweat, game playing, broken bones and bottles of tabasco sauce have taken Monolith to where it is today (well maybe not the tabasco). \n         I'm currently engaged in a project that I would love to talk about but cant (due to nda), but I can assure you that the end result will please a heck of alot of people out there! \n        On a more social note, I must admit to having a rather large knowledge of good drinking establishments around the Seattle area (maybe this isn't a bad thing). The only thing lacking out here is a good techno club. I miss the music from the UK alot and grunge still seems to be hanging on by a hair.......\n         Well, time to move on. I will gather lots of coolness for my next plan updates - look forward to a nice debate about Direct3D and OpenGL and what exactly I think about that whole situation and maybe also debates about which is better - the Honda CBR600 F3 or the Yamaha YZF600R... :)\n\n\n\n \n"}, {"by": "bbates@legendent.com", "time": 991245480, "contents": "Bob Bates\nStudio Head\n\n--\n5/30/01\n\nAmidst all the chaos of E3 and the great (and deserved) reaction \nthat Mike and the Unreal 2 team are getting, my game design book \nfinally appeared on store shelves.\n\nIt's called \"Game Design:  The Art and Business of Creating Games\"\nand  it's now also available on Amazon.com and \nBarnes&Noble.com, whose editors gave it a very kind review.\n\nFor more info, including the Table of Contents check out \nwww.bobbates.com\n"}, {"by": "bdube@ravensoft.com", "time": 1022884080, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Bryan Dube\nEmail: bdube@ravensoft.com\nDescription: Programmer\nProject: SoF2 MP\nLast Updated: 05/30/2002 16:02:13 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5/30/2002\n  So, whats happening in the world of Sof2 multiplayer you ask?  Well, hopefully this \n  will answer that question. First we would like to address some of the bigger known \n  issues that Raven is actively trying to resolve.  These are by no means the only issues \n  we are looking at, but instead the larger issues.  When a patch is released a full \n  list of changes made will be released along with it as well as updated mod source.\n\n  * INVALID_CDKEY\n    It seems that some people are having issues playing online due to this message.  We \n    are actively looking into this problem and ask that anyone who receives this \n    problem send us and email at sof2mp@ravensoft.com with their ip address and the time\n    of day that it occurred.  With that info we can try to figure out why your cdkey is \n    being listed as invalid.\n\n  * Linux RMG Issues\n    We are narrowing down on this issue and hope to have it resolved soon.\n\n  * Demo Recording\n    Seems that you cannot play back a recorded demo right now, this is also top on the \n    list of things to resolve.\n\n  * BAN LIMITATIONS\n    The current banning system has a few flaws which is making it hard to admin friendly \n    fire servers.  We are currently working on improving this system.\n\n  * CHEAT PROTECTION\n    Raven will soon be taking measures to help keep sof2 as cheat free as possible, more \n    information on this to come.\n\n\n  Along with bug fixes we will also be adding some new content as well.  This content will \n  include the demolition (someone set us up the bomb) gametype which is a nice alternative \n  to infiltration and allow servers to change it up a bit.  Along with this gametype we\n  will also be including a few new Raven made maps, at least one which will support the new\n  demolition gametype.  This is the first installment of new content for Sof2 multiplayer\n  from Raven and im sure will be a welcome addition.\n\n  As if that werent enough we are also working on integrated voice communications.  This\n  should make the process of using  voice communication in sof2 a much easier process.  More\n  details will be released on this when its becomes available for  use.\n\n  One more thing that will be added is a MODS menu which will list the installed mods and\n  allow for easy transition to them.\n\n  Last I would like to mention the forums and the bug report email address that have been\n  set up.  We are actively reading  the forums, responding to issues, and writing down\n  suggestions for improvements as well as supporing the quickly growing  mod community.  The\n  email address (which i mentioned previously) has been setup as a way to send bug reports\n  for multiplayer to us.\n\n  Forums:\n    http://204.97.248.99/ib/ikonboard.pl\n\n  Email Address:\n    sof2mp@ravensoft.com\n\n\n\n5/03/2002\n   Well, this is my first plan update so why not make it a big one.  Since the Sof2 test was\n   release and we have recieved a few hundred emails with suggestions and comments for \n   improvements.  The following is a list of what has been fixed, changed, and or updated \n   since the test build was made available.

We hire his company, and thus he ends up working under contract\nfor us.  Just thought i'd let everyone know.\n\nI was just sitting in my office, minding my own business, when something\nsuddenly struck me, and i though i'd share that with you also.  It's my humble\nopion that some of the current immagration laws are really backwards and\nscrewed up.\n\n===============================================================================\nMarch 20, 1997\n\nWell, i got many requests for the legal notices i mentioned tuesday.  So, if\nyou wish to do this, we'd appreciate it:\n\n\"QUAKE(r) is a registered trademark of Id Software, Inc.  QUAKE(r), the\nstylized reproduction of the QUAKE(r) trademark, including, without limitation,\nthe Q in QUAKE(r),  and the images depicted in QUAKE(r) are the copyrighted\nproperty of Id Software, Inc.\"\n\nAlso, i was reading what i wrote last night, and noticed that my explaination\nwasn't really as good as it could be.  In a nutshell, the law would not protect\nus if we do not actively attempt to make sure people have permission to use our\ntrademarked/copyrighted materials.  A lawyer can simply say \"see here your\nhonor, they knew people where not giving them legal credit, yet they did noth-\ning\".  By doing that we would be showing a history of 'waiving our rights' to\nour logos and other property, and thus we would loose the battle.\n\nThanks to everyone who wrote and said 'hey, i want to put the legals up'!\n\n===============================================================================\nMarch 18, 1997\n\nWell, as i mentioned previously it's been forever since i updated my .plan.\nJust wanted to take a bit of time to comment on a couple of things:\n\n1.  I received several e-mails and phone calls from reporters regarding all\nthe different changes (primarily personnel leaving), and what effect this has\nhad on id.  Well, frankly, in today's society, people don't stay at one place\nas long as they used to.  Thems is the facts.  So, when people leave, you\njust have to find new ones, and hope that they work.  We have an amazing set of\ntalanted people here at id, and we truly feel that because of this, the next\ngame we release will be our best to date.  Essentially, what i'm trying to say\nis, the team here is as strong as ever, and the atmosphere here is tremendous.\n\n2.  I would like to clarify something about a message that Todd (our CEO) was\nsending to the people in charge of all of the Quake/id related Web Sites.\nEssentially, we are attempting to get everyone who uses our trademarked/copy-\nrighted materials, to put a simple legal notice that states that our assets\nare the property of id, and that they are used under our permission.  Well,\nmy PR firm calls me a few weeks ago and says that word is out that id is\n'bashing' the web people for using our stuff.  This is simply horseshit.  We\nMUST protect our assets and we were just asking nicely if the web masters\nwould put a small legal notice up, that's all, not extorting money from them\nor telling them we were going to sue them or anything like that.  Anyway,\nif we don't actively take a position of concern about our things, then when\nsome company comes along, and truly does outright exploit our stuff (that's a\nnice way of saying steal or attempt to screw us ;), then we don't have a legal\nleg to stand on.  This is the case because the legal system looks at it as if\nwe just stood by while letting everyone use our stuff, not doing anything.\nThe court doesn't particularly care whether it's someone using your property\nfor goodi or not, only that the owner didn't make an effort to protect it.\n\nSo, that's the deal with the legal notice thing, it's just to protect us from\nbeing hosed in the future, not to get shitty with the web sites, we _totally_\napprectiate the attention that so many people give our products.\n\n3.  Christian, Xian, Disruptor, damn glad he's here.  I was at the brink of\ndrowning, and we are psyched to have him on board, he is a great asset, very\ntalented.  Also should mention that we have a new level designer named Paul\nJaquays (pronounced Paul, oh shit, that's the easy name, pronounced\n'jake-ways').  He's another 'older fella', at 40 (i think he said he was 40).\nAnyway, i guess that just means more seasoned gamers on the team, and he's\nbeen around the gaming industry for many years.  We're glad to get both of\nthem!\n\n\n===============================================================================\nFeb 18, 1997\n\n. . . Ok, ok, so i got side tracked.  I'll be back to finish this later . . .\n\n\n===============================================================================\nJan 28, 1997\n\nWell, it's been nearly a year since i edited my .plan file, so i thought\nit was about time to do so.\n\nI started here, as most of you know, as the person in charge of our customer\nsupport.  But, things change, the world is dynamic.\n\nRecently we've had many changes, people leaving, etc.  I received many inquires\nas to my opinion on how all of these 'departures' have affected id as a company.\n"}, {"by": "beau@ritual.com", "time": 923218020, "contents": "\n*** Ritual Entertainment's Finger Server\n\nUser name: beau\nPlan modified: Fri Dec 04 13:48:50 1998\n\nYou have reached Beau Anderson's .plan\nbeau@ritual.com\nArtist - 3d Modeler/Texture/Animator/Skin guy\n\n12/4/98\n\nThe Sin tools are out.

Grab it now and get Bloody! :)\n\nhttp://www.the-chosen.com/patch/\n\n1/28/99\n\nThe Blood 2 patch is almost done!! There are just a few more bugs to kill, then once QA gives the OK, we'll release the patch. We've been working day and night to finish the patch so that everyone can have an awesome multiplayer experience. The patch will contain new maps, optimized MP code, and if everything goes well, it'll have the new Input code too. So, now those people who use joysticks should be able to \"tweak their sticks\" (couldn't resist!) to their hearts content. Mouse wheel support should also be included as well. I've been helping to test the patch when I have free time and I've got to say...it rocks! CTF and TEAMS are a blast! Everything is pure butter in terms of the smoothness of play. Everyone will be shocked at how fun it is to Bloodbath. :)\n\nThe SHOGO (you have played SHOGO, right??) Input patch is coming along too. It's the same code that should be included in the Blood 2 patch. Joystick and mouse wheel support is almost here.\n\np.s. check out our web site (http://www.lith.com) tonight or tomorrow for info on our hot, new \"secret project\"! :)\n\np.p.s. BUY SHOGO! The game rocks!\n\np.p.p.s. Check out the GRUNTZ demo at: http://www.gruntzgoo.com/dl/\n\nBenny Kee\nMonolith Tech Support12/9/98\n\nThe Blood 2 Multiplayer patch is coming along nicely. I've been given the ok to let people know that the patch will be out before X-Mas. Won't be long now. Bloodbathing just goes to another level over what's out now. Nothing can compare...not Quake whatever or Half-Life...nothing. The MadSkillz levels are the funnest. Nothing to hide around or duck behind. Just you and your target and an extra large can of corn flavored Whup Ass (low fat,of course)!\n\nI'm still in shock that we, little Monolith, managed to steal Septerra Core away from all those \"other\" huge publishers! This game is the game that I've been waiting for ever since I saw my first pic all those moons ago. Looks like we're turning into a serious publisher! :)\n\nI wish I could go on about all the other awesome games that we have in store your you next year, but I like my job, so I better shut-up now. Let me just say that we are going to be a SERIOUS player next year!\n\nI'd like to welcome Bob (Idgit) Givnin to the Tech Support team. He and I are burning, trying to answer all your e-mails in a timely fasion. Together, we are responsible for handling support for all of our six games (and climbing!). Anybody out there who wants to, say hey to Bob and give him an \"atta boy\"! Both Bob and I are drummers, so you can imagine the noise that our two rooms create. Bob's blasting LIVE and I'm cranking the new Buddy Rich Memorial CDs! God I love Big Band! :)\n\nI heard that Zelda sold over 1 million copies in two weeks! Baffling...but what would you expect from the all-time greatest video game ever? Zelda is pure perfection, period. I'm also digging Jane's WWII Fighters! The flight model...butter! The graphics...wonderous! But it's the music that I love the best! Who ever decided to have Big Band music in the game needs to be congratulated or given money or something! Brilliant move! Baulder's Gate is going gold this week. I can't believe I'll be playing it by the end of the month! Congrats to everyone at BIOWARE!\n\nI've got to say that there hasn't been so many awesome games released in a long time. The games keep getting better and better!\n\nOh ya...FREZZA Italian Soda ROCKS! It's YUM in a bottle!\n\nLater all,\n\nBenny (Sticks) Kee\n10/14/98\n\nWhew! Just finished answering all the e-mails from the SHOGO demo launch. Bob and I answered 1786 e-mails in 8 days!! Thats 223 e-mails each day!!! Holy Crap! No wonder we're both dog-ass tired! I'd like to see another Tech department with 2 people do that! :)\n\nRage is FLYING off the shelves!! Ya hoo! Go get yourself a copy of this gem and experience the magic that is RAGE! If you see a character called Benny in a MP game, please don't PK me!\n\nShogo launches in 5 days now. You have pre-ordered it, right? You better if you haven't, or you'll be left without when the game is released. To say SHOGO is great, doesn't come close to reality! For me, SHOGO is the most fun, best use of pixles in ANY 3D shooter out. :)\n\nBlood 2 is coming down to the wire now. I'll be busting my ass helping to test the game before we send her on her way. Damn! They want me to play an awesome game AND pay me to do it?? The things I do! ;)\n\nBenny\n\n\n7/17/98\n\nRage of Mages is coming along nicely! I finished all my work on cleaning up the English for the game and the manuel. We also just finished recording the US voices for the game. It was an experience listening to the actors that played the voices for RoM. 4 people did over a dozen different parts. I contributed to the game as well, playing the part of a peasant (what else!) and a male Mage Mercenary. The funniest part was an actor named John who portrayed a drunken merchant. I was rolling on the floor when he recorded his lines! Now all we have to do is finish cutting the US dialog and stick it in the game, redo the music and complete the manuel (which is just about done now), and we're done with the game. I think a LOT of people are going to like RoM. It skillfully combines the RTS and RPG in a way that's fresh and exciting.\n\nGet Medieval is done!! I went through the \"final\" burn looking for goofs and couldn't find any. This game is going to rock!\n\nGruntz is a really fun game. It's like Lemmings meets Syndicate on crack. Once you start playing, you can't stop. This is going to be a surprise to everyone when it comes out.\n\nWhat can I say about Shogo? Gimme this game NOW!!! Everytime I poke my head into one of the level designers offices, I'm completely blown away! Being a musician too, I found that Shogo's dynamic music adds to the game in a way that \"normal\" music cannot. The music fits the game perfectly and invokes feelings of tension, panic, etc.\n\nBlood 2 is sweet! I've never loved gibbing someone so much! I heard from a lot of people who are fans of Blood 1, about how concerned they are because Blood 2 takes place in the future. They're worried that the \"horror\" mood that Blood has won't be in Blood 2 and all I can say is don't worry! If you liked Blood in even the tiniest way, you are going to LOVE Blood 2!!\n\nOh ya, on a side note, Benwa just bought himself a brand new, 1998, Chili Pepper Red, Dodge Durango. Benwa is happy! This SUV is the \"bomb\", the \"shit\" or whatever slang term you care to use. Power everything; a monsterous 5.2L Magnum V8 (gas-a-holic unfortunately); CD/tape/radio; cruise; trip meter; air; the list goes on. Monolith pays well for Technical Support! I love this company!! ;)\n\nB\n\n\n6/19/98\n\nI've finished translating Rage of Mages from really, really bad broken English, to really good understandable English. I ended up changing about 4.70 megs of just text in all. The game is taking on a new feel, now that the English is in. All we need now, is Dan the Man to record the voice for the game, and we got ourselves a RPG! This game is going to blow a lot of people away with it's depth and challenge. The game is HARD! You can't just run your way through the game. You'll need to carefully outfit your characters and plan your moves carefully if you want to finish this game!\n\n\n6/1/98\n\nShogo testing starts real soon (you gotta see this game to believe it!), Blood 2 is looking awesome, and I've finished pre-translations of the Allods dialog. (Rage of Mages is going to be the new title) RoM looks like it would be a simple RPG, but it's fairly deep and very challenging. RPG'ers are going to love it!\n\nOh ya, I finally bought myself a DVD player. If anyone knows of some kick ass martial arts, or sci-fi titles, e-mail me! :)\n\n\n\n\n6/1/98\n\nJust came back from a vacation to Vegas. I had tons of fun! Saw the Hoover Dam (good lord it's big!) a couple of \"Vegas\" shows, and hit the Star Trek Experience. WOW, if you are a Star Trek fan, you GOTTA see this! The first part is a huge timeline describing everything that ever happened in Star Trek. Opposite the Timeline is a meandering display case, filled with Star Trek props. Phasers, Tricorders, Zephram Cochran's First Contact outfit, three Borg drones plus the Borg queen's skull, Spock's transmitter that he built in \"City on the Edge of Forever\", Gorkon's throne and a wall of Klingon weaponry and tons more. After you finish looking at everything, you line up to board a transport to another area and then everything goes black. A huge gust of wind, shimmering lights and suddenly, you're on the Starship Enterprise! You could feel the thrumming of the ship under you. Riker comes on a monitor and tells the ensigns in the Transporter room to take everybody up to the bridge. After walking through the halls of the ship you enter the Bridge. The crew is walking around, doing their tasks, and then you see Riker on the viewscreen who fills you in on how you got here and why you are here. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but the shuttle escape is the most gut turning, effects ridden ride I've ever been on. It was SWEET! :) After the trip, I stopped in Quark's Bar and had myself a cool Romulan Ale! There's nothing like a strong, alien beverage! Ka' Pla!\n\n\n\n4/24/98\n\nHi there! My name is Benny and I run the tech support and quality assurance department here at Monolith. I thought I'd start up a .plan file and see how it goes.\n\nWhat's new...lot's of people trying out the Blood 3DFX alpha patch. There are three main concerns that people are having. \n\nOne, the game is too bright. I've posted a fix for this on our Blood web site already. Hopefully we can \"tone down\" the gamma for the next version of the 3DFX patch.\n\nTwo, the 3D cards are running out of texture memory. I don't know what to tell people about this problem, besides restarting the game again. If anyone out there knows why the 3D cards texture memory is not being flushed to allow for new textures, please, please e-mail me! :)\n\nThree, people are trying to use their RUSH and Voodoo 2 based 3D cards. I guess that when they downloaded the patch, these people missed the big letters that said \"Voodoo RUSH and Voodoo 2 cards will NOT be supported!\" I'm getting e-mails asking why they can't get their card to work, and all I can say is that these cards are not supported and may not work. Some daring people on the Blood forum have been able to get their Voodoo 2 cards to take the patch by fiddling around with the drivers, or settings, or whatever. I still haven't heard from a RUSH owner that's been able to get the patch to work. If you are that owner, drop me an e-mail describing what you did.\n\nRIOT: Mobile Armor is looking freakin' awesome! I can't wait to head up the bug testing on this baby. Whoever said \"size doesn't matter\" hasn't played RIOT yet! Stomping around in a 40 foot transformable Mech is the way to go. The level designers, Nathan, Craig and Todd are cranking out the levels like their lives depended on it. They get this glazed stare in their eyes...it's kind of freaky. I guess that's what happens when you eat, drink, and breath one thing for too long. The game is going to ROCK because of it, so I don't mind if they go insane! :)\n\nBlood 2 is looking sweet as well. Some of the things I've seen will make your skin crawl! Can't say much more than that, other than Jay and his Blood 2 crew are going to blow peoples minds!\n\nGet Medieval is thiiiis close '___' from being finished. I haven't had so much fun playing a game since I can remember. Keep your eye out for this gem. The beginning and ending movies are the funniest I've seen yet in a video game, and I personally own more than 800 games! GM is overflowing with humor and the 4-player action can have you reaching for your canister of oxygen! Very cool game! :)\n\nMore things about me...I'm also a professional musician. Drummer is my trade. Been playing for 22 years now. Jazz and funk are my favorite styles to play. I've had the good fortune to tour Japan and California and I've played with some of the best in the music industry. I've setup my electronic kit here in my office, so anytime I feel the need to beat the hell out of something, I just switch seats and pound away. There's nothing better for stress.\n\nI'll start a movie review section here. Cool or Sucks are the ratings. Go see the cool movies and avoid the ones that suck!\n\nLost in Space                     Cool\nTitanic                           Cool\nGood Will Hunting                 Cool\n\nI just picked up Acclaim's Forsaken today. Sweet graphics, but the single player game is hurting. There are only 15 levels to play! Not nearly enough. A game like Forsaken should have at least 30 levels to play, plus DM maps. Everybody is so wrapped up in this \"Multiplayer\" kick, that the single player games are starting to suffer. It's sad really. Oh well. At least our games aren't going down that path!\n\nThat's about it for now. Until something exciting happens!\n\nBenny Kee\nMonolith Tech Support/Quality Assurance\n\n\n \n\n"}, {"by": "bgokey@humanhead.com", "time": 965782080, "contents": "Welcome to Human Head Studios' Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Ben Gokey\nEmail: bgokey@humanhead.com\nDescription: Programmer\nProject: Rune\nWeb Page: Human Head Studios' Web SiteThis plan file is the opinion of the individual who writes it and does not reflect the opinions of the Human Head Studios.\nLast Updated: 05/19/1999 21:19:16 (GMT Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"}, {"by": "billv@lith.com", "time": 919579980, "contents": "\n*** Monolith Production's Finger Server\n\nUser name: billv\nPlan modified: Sun Feb 21 00:18:04 1999\n\n2/21/99\n\nFinally sat down and played through Half-Life. It didn't take me that long, mostly because I had already watched people here play through the difficult parts, but I have to say it was a very full game. It definitely deserves all the kudos it got, and then some. If you're one of those few people like myself who passed on Half-Life at first, then take my word for it and make it the next game you buy. A delicious blend of Quake and the X-Files.\n\nHigh point: Hearing the assassins move only when I moved. Recently got an SB Live with my speakers set up sorta surround-style, and damn... I haven't been that creeped out since Doom. -Very- nice touch.\n\nLow point: What's with the crouch-jump making you jump higher than a regular jump? I'm not talking about the long jump here. If I walk up to a low crate and try to jump on it, I can't. But, if I crouch in front of it, and then jump, I can make it. Weird. Maybe it's just me. I mean, I guess I could get more air if I crouched and really sprang for it, but in Half-Life the difference between a jump and a crouch-jump is small... just enough to get you on the average crate, apparently.\n\nAnother cool product... MP3Spy! Definitely give this one a go and see if your bandwidth is good enough for it. Ever get tired of having the same music to listen to at work day after day? MP3Spy is your answer. Highly reccomended. (Gosh, hope PlanetCrap doesn't read that...)\n\n2/7/99\n\nDoing research for my first level on \"the other secret project,\" I bought and watched two of my favorite films: La Femme Nikita and Point of No Return. No Return is the American remake of Nikita, which is the French original. In a nutshell, it's the story of a deadly little social outcast named Nikita who commits a murder and is caught. The government gives her a second chance, though, training her as a sleeper -- a special operative who lives a normal life, only being called to action when needed. She falls in love and goes through the agony of hiding her secret life from her fiance.\n\nIt's interesting to see just how much flavor is lost in the translation, although there are elements in No Return that Nikita could use; mainly some more character development. (That could just be the American take on the Nikita character -- less psychotic and more of a victim.) Nikita is a far better film as far as directing and acting goes, imho. Jean Reno keeps the title as best \"Cleaner.\" Overall, the American version feels corny by comparison... much more Hollywood (like the addition of the exploding hotel) in ways which eliminate some of the story's subtleties. All the classic scenes are there, however. Add to that an all-star cast (Bridget Fonda, Gabriel Byrne, Harvey Kietel) and you have a pretty fun remake.\n\nExpect to see some Nikita references in \"the yer-to-be-revealed other secret project.\" ;)1/26/99\n\nHappy New Year...\n\nJust a quick update here. Been working on the add-on pack for Blood2 lately. Before that, I did a few things for the multiplayer patch and also took some time to visit my folks for the holidays. Next week I'll be moving on to one of Monolith's \"super-secret projects\" for a while.\n\nBook reccomendation of the moment... Barlowe's Inferno, Wayne D. Barlowe, Morpheus, 1998\n\nWhat's by my CD player... the latest from Black Tape for a Blue Girl, a tribute album to Dead Can Dance called The Carnival Within, and two from Haujobb... Freeze Frame Reality and Solutions for a Small Planet. All excellent subdued work music.\n\nMore later... hope that HTML works...\n\n"}, {"by": "bjames@idsoftware.com", "time": 896072160, "contents": "Welcome to id Software's Finger Service V1.4!\n\nName: Brandon James\nEmail: bjames@idsoftware.com\nDescription: Designer\nProject: Quake 3\nLast Updated: 05/25/1998 01:50:15 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMay 25th, 1998\n\nI wanted to take the time out and give a big whopping\nthumbs up to ASC Games who, as of late, have been to me\nthe 'Miramax' of the industry.

The smaller update which updates from 1.3 to 1.31 was released this afternoon. After thorough testing on the servers setup by Xian, Fred, Speakeasy and others, we decided everything was stable and ready for release! The sticking, warping and teleportation issues introduced in version 1.3 have been squashed.\n\nIncluded in the patch is mp_pakmaps1.pk3, which contains the map, \"Ice\". The version of \"Ice\" that is included with version 1.31 is not compatible with the version released in 1.3, due to some bug fixes. To make the world a better place, and to get all players on the same version of the game, I'd strongly suggest everyone upgrade to 1.31. \n\nPeople sticking with version 1.3 and trying to play \"Ice\" will not be able to do so on servers that have properly upgraded to version 1.31.\n\nThe auto-update server will be going live soon. We decided to release the full patch to the websites and popular download sites in order to spread out the bandwidth for such a large update. Future auto-updates will take place for smaller downloads, the\nmajority of which will be code only.\n\nSee you on the battlefield,\n\n-B\n\n-------------\nOlder Updates\n-------------\n\nThe testing of the latest WolfMP code on Xian and Fred's servers has been going great! There have been some very, very intense matches on Xian's mp_base server, which I was completely addicted to last night.\n\nIn addition to Xian and Fred's servers, we've released the code (as talked about in yesterday's update) to a handful of other servers. If you'd like to help test it out, connect to one of the updated servers below:\n\nSPEAKEASY.net - Dallas RTCW - 64.81.127.136:27965\nSPEAKEASY.net - Boston RTCW - 66.92.64.136:27965\nSPEAKEASY.net - Denver RTCW - 64.81.111.136:27965\nSPEAKEASY.net - Seattle RTCW - 63.251.171.135:27965\nSPEAKEASY.net - Chicago RTCW - 64.81.159.136:27965\nSPEAKEASY.net - Atlanta RTCW - 216.27.175.136:27965\nSPEAKEASY.net - Los Angeles RTCW - 64.81.45.136:27965\nSPEAKEASY.net - Philadelphia RTCW - 66.92.224.136:27965\nSPEAKEASY.net - San Francisco RTCW  -  64.81.79.136:27965\nSPEAKEASY.net - New York City RTCW - 216.254.95.136:27965\nSPEAKEASY.net - Washington DC RTCW - 66.92.159.136:27965\nShack RTCW [CHI] SPEAKEASY.net - 64.81.159.136:666\nShack RTCW [DFW] SPEAKEASY.net  - 64.81.127.136:666\nShack RTCW [NYC] SPEAKEASY.net - 216.254.95.136:666\n\nYou must have 1.3 installed in order to connect!\n\nThanks for all the great feedback so far and to the admins running the latest code. See you on-line.\n\n-B\n\n--------------\nMarch 18, 2002\n--------------\n\n\"Medic!\"\n\nThe WolfMP 1.3 patch has hit the net fixing numerous bugs and exploits while also introducing support for Punk Buster, auto-updates, MP_ICE (which seems to be a hit!) and the groundwork for loading up user-created Mods. While squashing and ridding the world of these bugs, we introduced a new issue that is affecting gameplay..\n\nMost notably, the problems related to reviving and the teleportation, or warping that some have experienced on certain maps. Luckily, these issues are all a byproduct of a fix for reviving players on and around script_mover's (the giant doors in mp_assault). We've been testing the fix for this internally and others have been testing it as well and everything appears to be back to normal. The fix is a server side issue, which can be tested if you connect to one of the servers listed below.\n\n192.246.40.64:27960 - Xians MP_BEACH server \n192.246.40.45:27960 - Xians MP_DESTRUCTION server\n192.246.40.43:27960 - Xians MP_ICE server\n192.246.40.45:27961 - Xians MP_BASE server \n192.246.40.66:27961 - Fred's MP_BASE server\n192.246.40.108:27960 - Xians MP_TRENCHTOAST server\n\nInformation, stats and forums for Xians servers can be found at:\nhttp://underworld.idsoftware.com/wolf\n\nIf all goes well with this fix, the update will be in your hands after thorough testing. As always, an announcement will be made prior to release.\n\nDetailed bug reports can be sent to: wolfbugs@idsoftware.com and wolfbugs@nervesoftware.com\n\nMost of us involved in the project can be found trolling around Wolfenstein specific sites such as planetwolfenstein.com, wolfensteinx.com and rtcwcentral.com. If there is a concern or bug reported at any of the above, we've seen it.\n\nBig thanks to Fred and Xian at Id for testing this out!\n\n-B"}, {"by": "blake.hutchins@dynamix.com", "time": 938728380, "contents": "Message of the Day:\n\nWelcome to the Dynamix Finger Server!\nbe sure to check out http://www.dynamix.com\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUser Name: blake.hutchins     Plan Last Modified: 09/30/1999 15:57:36 PST\n\n\n\nblake.hutchins.plan\n\n\n9.17.99\n\n\n\nSo, kids, here we are in the depths of developing TRIBES Extreme.\n\n\nThings are busy as sin on the writing end, which has led to a delay in completing the\nmuch demanded WEAPONS & TECHNOLOGY packet. I'm chipping away at D-back's draft a little more each\nday, but it's slow going, I'm afraid. Sorry about the wait. The packet will answer a number of\n\"universe technology\"questions folks have been asking, so I think it'll be worth the wait.\n\n\nOn the other fronts, I'm having a ton of fun with Extreme. In addition to all the cool story-related\nstuff, we're working on a TRIBES comic to be released online. It'll be called OATH: The Bronze Skull,\nand will set up the events that underlie the campaign story shipping with the game. Yours truly is\nthe writer, the ever-talented Robert Caracol is doing the pencils, and Ian Christy (known to the\nStarsiege contingent as \"Plague Dog\") is responsible for the coloring. So far I can say this is an\nabsolutely AWESOME project. I'm having a blast - writing for the comic book format is way different\nthan writing completely text-based stories. The completed pages are just amazing, and they really\nbring a new perspective to the TRIBES setting.\n\n\nAs you may have seen, I'll be appearing at a chat this Friday celebrating the one year anniversary\nof the Sons of Thunder tribe. These cats have a completely boss site with a dramatic design and\nvery impressive cultural detail. It feels authentic, and the SoT are a gracious presence in the community,\nso check it out. I'll bring an original story featuring some of the SoT principals and perhaps offering\nsome hints into the TRIBES Extreme storyline. See you there!\n\n\nOn the Starsiege side, I've been fielding a ton of questions about the timeline. In response, I've sent\nKamosa text files of the timelines for the Human and Cybrid campaigns. Hopefully these will answer\nmost questions.\n\n\nOutside the building stuff: the Hood to Coast relay race was pretty amazing, one of the most incredible experiences\nI've ever had. The Dynamix TechNo Prisoners team showed a lot of grit and resolve. We started on\nFriday, August 27 at 2:30 p.m. and finished somewhat blearily at about 6 p.m. the following evening. My middle leg\n(Don't even THINK it, VanSmack!) fell at about 4:00 a.m., somewhere west of Portland. Running through\nhilly back roads in the dark was surreal, especially when you saw the bobbing pinpricks of runners'\nflashlights trailing off into the distance. Weirdly beautiful, and the distances gave me a new appreciation\nfor how much those tribals run! Maybe we should do motion capture for TRIBES 2 that shows the warriors\npanting and trying to rub out cramps if they run too far without resting. I look forward to running the\nHood to Coast again next year. And for those of you who came in late, the HtC is a 196-mile long relay\nrace that goes from Mount Hood east of Portland to the town of Seaside on the Oregon coast. Teams\nconsist of twelve members, each of whom runs three legs for an average total of sixteen miles per runner.\n\n\nWell, I see it's time to go vacuum the fleas off D-back, so I'll sign off.\nEveryone stay cool and have fun!\n\n\nHEXABOLIC\n\n\n\n7.2.99\n\n\n\nFourth of July coming up out here, and I'm seeing Captain America skins on the in-house servers.\n\n\nCoincidence? I don't think so.\n\n\nThings are busy on this end as TRIBES Extreme is moving along with increasing omentum.\nI'm working the story and text angle on the game, and it should be interesting, offering a grittier\nlook at the TRIBES setting and giving the player a real opportunity to practice the fine art of\ncommand. In other developments, I'm working on expanding the TRIBES Universe. The plan now is\nto release a new background pack every month. The tentative schedule is to put out The FIRETRUCE\nnext week. Then by August, you'll see WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY. Thereafter, a packet for each of the\nFour Great Tribes, THE IMPERIAL LEGATE, IMMORTALS, BIODERMS, ALIEN RACES, THE FRAYED, BIRA MARDUK,\nGRIEVER BANDS, and a WILDERZONE STARMAP. I'm looking forward to putting these together. If we get\nenough input from you folks, we may expand on other parts of the background as well. Aside from these\nsetting expansions, there'll be more stories to set up the storyline for TRIBES 2 -- maybe even some\nweb-based comics, a project about which I'm particularly excited. In all cases, we'll show you more\nabout the epic TRIBES background. I've been talking to some of the Tribes out there, and I plan to\nincorporate some player storylines into the background where possible, so stay in touch!\n\n\nOn the Starsiege side, I've had less time, but I still plan to complete the Writer's Guide and\nthe novella, so stay tuned.\n\n\nKeeping busy training for the Hood to Coast, a 195 mile relay race that takes place at the end of\nAugust. Dynamix is fielding a team called \"TechNo Prisoners.\" Should be a blast, if I can just \ncontinue to avoid injury. If the race goes well, I'll shoot for the Portland Marathon in October.\nAll you tribals out there: keep checking your shoes! When you're running a lot, it doesn't take much\ntime to put 500 miles on those soles!\n\n\nIn other news, personal writing's going pretty well. I'm fortunate enough to be in a writers' group with\na few Nebula winners, including the guy who just won this year's Nebula and Stoker awards, a\nMr. Bruce Holland Rogers. If you haven't read his stuff yet, check it out. Not for the casual reader, but\nvery cool nevertheless. On my end, I'm working on the rewrites for a couple of projects that I hope\nto sell by the end of the year. Sometimes I have to be reminded that there's more to write about than the \nwilderzone. Heh.\n\n\nStay cool, everyone.\n\n\nHEXABOLIC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.18.99\nHello, all:\n\n\nI'm the Writer on Tribes and Starsiege, the guy responsible for overseeing the Universe\nand story angle of things -- with the able assistance of everybody's favorite D-back, natch.\n\n\nWe're expanding the Starsiege Universe in a big way. As an example, I've been working on\nthe Tribes Universe Writer's Guide, which is completed and should be posted on the website\nnow. This doc will provide a lot more detail about the scope of the Universe and\nTribal society, lay out the tribal calendar, and answer some questions about the Empire and\nits relationship with the Tribes. We'll also post Writer's Guidelines to help those of you\nwho want to write fan fiction for the Universe.\n\n\nOther projects include a Writer's Datapak on the BioDerms, the new force entering\nthe Tribes Universe, and a number of stories which will illuminate the intrigue brewing behind\nthe scenes. I envision releasing a series of Datapaks focusing on specific parts of the Universe,\nand I encourage you folks out there to let me know what trips your trigger; I'm more than happy\nto explore the areas you're interested in.

I just want to say a\nbig \"Thanks\" to everyone in the community who has taken the\ntime to offer their feedback/input/suggestions about it.  I\nwas very interested in some of the issues you all addressed and\nam currently doing a little redesign of the map to fix them.\nI would also like to say \"Thanks\" to Matt \"DaBug\" Hooper for\nleaving me some great stuff to work with to make SS7 into what\nit is today.  I hope the new Storm Sector 7 is even more enjoyable\nfor everyone.\n\nThings you can look forward to in the new SS7:\n\n- slight increase in overall size of the map to make it a little\n  harder to control the map in 1 on 1.\n- new areas added to support up to 16 players.  Remember though that\n  the maps will be scalable depending on the max_players, so that if\n  you want to play 1 on 1 the map can be scaled down to its current size.\n- lightning and thunder to accompany the rain effect.\n- thicker, more noticeable fog.  There was a very light fog in SS7,\n  but it was so light (so that it wouldn't hinder DM) that it was more\n  of a haze.  I like the idea of a thicker fog in the new version.  It\n  will make for a different approach to DM, and add some new elements \n  to gameplay.  Fog will be optional so if you don't like playing in the \n  thicker fog, you can simply turn it off.\n- improved lighting/lighting effects and sound.\n- possibly a cool trap we have been discussing to make the level more\n  interactive.\n- and of course, any and all bug fixes that were found.\n\nThanks again to everyone for the great feedback!\n\nThat's all for now kiddies.

Can't wait\nto get the public demo out to everyone so I can bust some \ncommunity skulls! :)  \n\nOn a sadder note, it is with deep regret that I must say that\nI can no longer make myself as available on ICQ as I have\nbeen.  It's just eating too much time, unfortunately, because\nI like to take the time to chat with all of you.  But, until\nfurther notice, I will be refraining from answering ICQ messages\nuntil we reach a point in development where I think I will\nhave the extra time.

Speaking of the demo, there have been some questions\nlately about when it will be out, and whether it will be Mplayer\nonly.  Well, the demo is done with the exception of a few last-minute\nbugs that need some killing.  Hopes are to have them killed and the\ndemo out by this weekend.  But even if it were to slip, never fear,\nit will be VERY soon!  As far as Mplayer goes, this is how it's gonna\nwork.  There will actually be TWO demos.  This first one is for the\nbig Mplayer DK DM tourney (the one where the top 4 people will get\nflown to the ION offices here in Dallas to DM against Romero, and\nprobably a few other of us as well).  As soon as the Mplayer competition\nis over, then a 2nd worldwide public release demo will go out.  The\n2nd demo will have some more of the cool stuff to be found in Daikatana\nthan the Mplayer demo will, so it will be worth the wait.  Hope that \nclears up some of the questions.\n\nOn the work side...\nnow that the demo is done, we are getting back to work\non finishing up the episode 2 (Greece) maps.  Alot of work to be done,\nbut we're all pretty excited to be working on something new after so much\ntime spent working on the episode 1 maps, and the maps for the DM demo.\nPersonally, I'm back to work on E2M1, making lotsa cool outdoor stuff and\nGreek ruins.  It's kinda fun to build some cool looking architecture and then \nget to go back and tear it all down, or maybe I'm just weird. :)\n\nOn a completely off-topic note...\nI enjoy stopping by Evil Avatar's site every once in a while.  His site is \nalways good for a laugh.  Got another hearty chuckle from his comment about me\nspending more time doing .plan updates and interviews than level designing.\nBut just for fun, let's break it down...\nIn 3 months I have done a grand total of *drum roll* 10 .plan updates, OH MY GOD!   \nThat turns out to be a .plan update about every 9 days.  And considering a .plan \nupdate takes about 5 minutes, I have wasted a grand total of 50 minutes of my spare \ntime doing .plan updates.

When\nthe community first got started, you didn't see all the \"news\"\nposts, and editorials, and gossip about who's doing what to whom\nbehind the scenes at Company X.  The community was more interested\nin making and playing cool games.  Nowadays, however, it seems that\nthe gaming community is developing more and more into a political\nand economical warzone, where the only thing anyone cares about is\nhow many \"hits\" their site is getting, or how many advertisers they\ncan lure to their site, or who they can \"tear down\" for whatever\npersonal vendetta they have.  It's disheartening to see what was once\nsuch a pure, fun-loving community degrading into something so \npolitical.  I sincerely hope that the community can soon return to\nthe way it was in its early form, where people's focus was on making\nand playing cool games and having a good time doing it.  \n\nOn that note, I just wanna say \"KUDOS\" to the entire \nPlanetQuake News staff.  Through all the recent anti-ION press, PQ is\nthe only site where I have not seen a single news post, article, or \nlink on the PQ news page about any of it.  It's refreshing to see that \nthere is still a news site that is actually more interested in news \nabout games, rather than jumping on the bandwagon of posting gossip about\na game company.\n\nAs always, if you have any comments or responses to anything\nI have said here, you are more than welcome to voice them to me via email\nat bobby@ionstorm.com.

Speaking of work, I'm busy\nputting the finishing touches on E1M5, should have it wrapped\nup pretty soon.  Just want to say that Steve Rescoe did some\nawesome stuff on E1.  The architecture is nothing short of\nstunning, and the layout of the level is extremely intricate,\nwrapping the level back around and over itself so that you \nrecognize where you have been, and areas that you discover \nlater in the level.  My only complaint would be that he might\nnot have been too concerned about r_speeds in a couple areas.\nNothing a few hint brushes and some very minor architecture\nfixes couldn't knock down.  But overall, I think the E1 levels\nare some of the best levels I have seen yet. \n\nFor those of you who have been asking about the tutorial about\nmaking terrain using the \"triangle method\" that I promised to do,\njust want to let you guys know that I am working on it right now,\nand hope to have it done by this weekend.  As soon as it's done,\nI'll send it on over to Fishman at RUST, so he can post it for \neveryone to see.\n\nI enjoyed the Daiaktana Cabana Chat last night.

Without this engine we wouldn't have been able \nto create such accurate looking Voyager rooms and locations. When we started \nbuilding levels, we made them like we did using Quake I & II technology. We \nhad big expansive levels that looked awesome and showed off what the Quake \nIII engine can do. Then, somewhere near the middle of our development we \nrealized that the file size of most of our levels were huge, around 11 to \n15 Meg a piece where they should be about 6meg. The levels were the normal \ngame-world size of a Quake II level, so what was the problem? The cause of \nthe problem was the high poly (or triangle count) used to create a much \nmore intricate and detailed environment. We realized that although Quake III \ncan handle more polygons in the view at one time, the file size for the level \nhas not increased much from a Quake II level. We had a dilemma; we can bring \nthe file size down by taking out all of the detail that makes the Quake III \nengine superior and keep the physical size, or we cut the size of the level \ndown making it smaller yet highly detailed. Since we are making a world that \ncan be compared to a TV show, we opted to keep the detailed environments of \nthe Star Trek universe and cut the level down in size. It was one or the \nother; we couldn't have our cake and eat it too. For the most part, we were \nable to cut the levels in half and make two separate levels out of them but \nnow all the level designers had twice the levels to work on from when they \nstarted and this could cause some major scheduling problems. Unfortunately, \nto keep up with the schedule, big parts of the levels were deleted and \nredesigned, which resulted in much smaller levels that could be traversed \nquicker and ultimately made for a shorter game to play for some gamers.\n\n\nBrian Pelletier\n- Project Leader: Star Trek Voyager Elite Force\n\n\n************************************************************************\n\n10-27-00\n\nHere is a question I got from a German magazine and I thought it would\nbe interesting to share.\n\n(German mag) Most of the Elite Force consumers say that the game was \na bit to short. What do you think about this? Why is the game so short? \nAre there any concrete reasons?\n\n(Me) In my opinion, there are two possible reasons, and here is the \nfirst one:\nMost of the consumers you're hearing from are hard-core FPS players \nand most of them are playing on Normal difficulty, which wasn't suppose \nto be the desired difficulty setting for them. This setting is actually \nthe easy mode with challenging being the medium difficulty and what \nexperienced players were intended to play. There is a HUGE difference in \ndifficulty between Normal and Challenging. This is our fault in our use \nof terminology, as we originally only had 3 difficulties (Normal, \nChallenging and Hard, easy to figure out that Challenging is medium since \nthere are only 3) and then we added the easy difficulty in the last month of \nthe game development, which was basically an effortless difficulty mode. \nWe left the terminology the same assuming most experienced players would \nplay a game in a mode called challenging, but in hindsight if I saw a \ngame that had a mode called normal, that's what I would play. This again \nis our fault for trying to be cleaver with our naming and also make the \ninexperienced gamer Star Trek fan (who wanted to play the game) feel like \na \"normal\" game player.\nFrom my experience with the game testers we had come into Raven, along with \nour internal testing and feedback we get from other average game players is \nthat it will take well over 15 hours to play the single player storyline \ngame for a casual gamer. The hard core FPS gamer takes a lot shorter to play \nbecause of the nature of how they play shooter games, which is fast, furious \nand running through the levels to get to the next. Average gamers are much \nslower and not as good, and since we are also creating a game for the average \nplayer and Star Trek fan, we didn't want to make it too hard for them. So \nbecause the game is a little easier to play for hardcore players on top of \nthe fact that they are playing on easy difficulty, made for one of the \nreasons why I believe the game was short for those types of gamers.\n\n\nI'll post reason number 2 on Monday which is more of a development and\ntechnical issue and in my opinion the real reason of why it is shorter\nto play than we wanted it to be.\n\nBrian\n\n\n***********************************************************************\n\n10-24-00\n\nAbout Elite Force's teammates.\n\nWe all know everyone has their own opinions and we have heard that \nElite Force's teammates are revolutionary and surpass any teammates \ndone for other games and we also heard that the teammates were nothing \nnew and they had problems and didn't really work that great. I would \nhave to disagree with the later and say that the teammates could have \neasily been a hindrance to the gameplay and now I know why no other \ncompany has ever tried to make a FPS game with up to five teammates \nWorking alongside you at one time. At one point in the final stages of \ndeveloping the teammates, I wasn't sure if they were going to work out, \nthey just had so many problems and every time we would fix something \nanother problem would crop up. Just getting them to follow you was not \nan easy task and something we tweaked with all the way up to the final \ndays. Sure we could get them to follow you but the game took place in \ntight hallways and small rooms so you would be bumping into them, they \nwouldn't get out of your way, they would constantly get stuck on each \nother and they followed the player like a heard of sheep. Also making \nthem always follow the player everywhere caused problems with them \nfeeling like real intelligent characters so sometime we had to have \nthem stand their ground or take up a position while the player went \nexploring. Then we had the consistent problems of the team not even \nfollowing you and you might need one of them to open a door for you to \nlater on and when we did get it to work someone eventually found a new \nway to break a level with a teammate. Plus with elevators and teleporters \nthere were always problems with how a teammate could get left behind. \nIt was getting to a point where we weren't even certain if we could get \nthem to walk through an entire level and we might have to do something \ndrastic. Luckily it never came to that and we were able to get them \nworking in the levels. They may have ran funny to catch up to the player \nor jumped down long elevator shafts to stay in formation, but at least \nthey stayed with the player through the whole level no matter what kinds \nof crazy stuff they player was doing. Then came the problem of trying \nto balance the combat with the teammates. We started getting our enemies \nin the levels and the teammates were so good they killed most of the \nenemies leaving not much for the player to do. So we didn't have them \nshoot as often but then THEY were constantly being attacked instead of \nthe player, and the game combat became shoot the aliens attacking your \nteammates, which was not fun. So we had to balance the combat so the \nplayer still felt threatened by enemies attacking them and teammates \nhelped but not to the point where they did all the work and eventually \nwe got something that felt really fun for the player. It's funny now \nwhen I hear people say that the teammates were stupid because they hardly \nkilled any enemies or that the enemies always attacked the player but \nhardly the teammates; If they only knew how not fun the gameplay would \nhave been had we not balanced it out the way we did.\n\n\nBrian Pelletier\n- Project Leader: Star Trek Voyager Elite Force \n\n\n*************************************************************************\n"}, {"by": "brad@lith.com", "time": 910199220, "contents": "Login: brad           \t\t\tName: Brad Pendleton\nDirectory: /home/brad               \tShell: /bin/bash\nNever logged in.\nNo mail.\nPlan:\n7/13/98\n\nWe're getting real close to the finish now and most of what's left is clean up.  I've been spending a lot of time on some of the physics.  Objects were tending to pass through each other, which was causing some big problems.  After spending way too much time thinking on it, I finally came up with a way to prevent the object tunneling without having to do too much extra processing.\n\nWe're also putting in some solutions for low end systems.  For low memory, Bouwman's putting in some functionality to compress the size of cached sounds.  My initial tests show that there's hardly any quality change.\n\nPersonal:\nSpeaking of spending way too much time, I've been painting the inside of my house.  I can't wait for that project to be finished.  Of course there are plenty of other projects left on the list.  It is very satisfying, though, to be able to fix your own house up.  I'm getting into all the suburbanite mannerisms.  For instance, I'm very proud of my lawn.  I get excited when I get to replace the inner mechanisms of a toilet.  And I can't wait to get on that roof.  All I have to do now is build up a beer gut and fill up my garage with stuff I'll never use.\n\n\n\n5/28/98\n\nOops.  I let my plan file lapse.  Here's what I've been doing:\n\nI've been focusing on getting Lithtech and Shogo faster.  There was a lot data being sent by the engine and the game, but much of it could be removed.  28.8 is a killer.  There were also some expensive functions getting called which left room for speeding up.  There's still more work to be done.  Mike put in object culling using the vis list which greatly reduced network traffic.  I put in a similar optimization for the sounds.\n\nComing up:  I'll be looking into making the file access faster.  Plus testing out a massive multiplayer.\n\nLife:\n\nI took my folks up to Hurricane Ridge this weekend.  It's a place with spectacular views of mountains and glaciers from a 5500' mountain top.  Unfortunately, the cloud layer went from 5000' to 6000' that day.  It was a nice drive anyway.\n\nAlong the way to Hurricane Ridge, we stopped in Bremerton to see the Battleship Missouri.  I was really looking forward to seeing it, but it was tucked between a bunch of other warships.  I was bummed, cuz the Missouri was leaving for Hawaii that same day.  By chance, several hours later, on the way back from Hurricane Ridge, the Missouri passed right in front of the ferry I was on.  It's a cool looking ship.\n\n\n4/20/98\n\nI just thought of a great new saying.  You know that plaque that hangs in your co-worker's office reading, \"A clean desk is a sign of an idle mind\".  I should get one that says, \"An updated plan file is a sign a person with nothing to do\" :)  That of course is a joke.  I'm just looking for an excuse for not updating my plan file in such a long time.  \n\nI'll just tell you what I've been doing.  Mike and I have been pounding out the engine.  Lately, I've been working on Load/Save game.  One thing I hope we can have is save games that don't get broken when you patch the game or the engine.  This would have to be done with some conversion utility.  Much of this conversion would be game specific, so the conversion utility would load the game dll and ask it to convert the data.  As a person that loves single player just as much as multiplayer, I have always wished for this feature.  Hopefully we can get it in. \n\n\n\n9/17/97\n\nAll right!  I finally made it to the bottom of the list.  Everyone has updated more often than me!  Kewl....\n\nSo I have been busy...ok ok...lazy about updating, sorry.\n\nLately, I have been upgrading the sound for DirectEngine.  Just to get by, we were playing any sound requested, regardless of what it did to frame rate.  So, my first order of business was to put in a sound scheduler.\n\nThe scheduler has a limited number of voice slots that can play sounds.  It determines which sounds to put into a voice slot based on the sounds voice type and priority.  The voice types are categories of sounds that are independent of each other, such as player sounds, enemy sounds, ambient sounds, etc.  Some voice slots will only play certain voice types, which will insure that at least one sound of that type gets played.  The other voice slots are given out on a first-come-first-serve basis.  This should be able to adjust itself to improve frame rate on the fly.  With Mike's work on moving from Dscript to C++ DLL's and this sound scheduler, Riot's frame rate may just get too high! :)\n\nThe sounds will be played through a plug-in DLL.  This lets us have different types of 3D sound.  Based on your frame rate, you can select the quality of the 3D sound, from simple panning to full 3D sound.\n\n\n\n8/5/97\n\nI have to share my last hiking trip with everyone.  Seattle has this big dormant volcano nestled right next to it and when the skies are clear, you get to stare at its beauty.  My wife and I decided to get closer, so we got in the truck and started driving.  This was around 1pm, and we hadn't had lunch yet.  If you know me, you know that I need to be fed or else everyone loses.  We decided to eat somewhere in Enumclaw, which was the last town before Mt. Rainier.  Enumclaw is a cute town out of the past.  Of course, when you're hungry, you want convenience, not cute.  Lucky for us, Enumclaw has this great little Italian sandwich shop right on 164.  I don't remember what it was called, but I doubt there are too many.  After filling up, we set off for the big mountain, which was another 30-45 minutes away.  The drive was fantastic, with sheer cliffs on one side of the road and little gushing springs on the other.  We parked at Tipsoo lake and walked around there a little.  There is a great picture spot from the road:  you get the lake and the mountain together.  We didn't know the trails, so we just guessed which trial head to take.  We took the one that starts near the log bridge the goes over the road.  This trail head appears to take you away from the mountain, and hence the fantastic pictures, but it is well worth the gamble, as you will soon find out.  The trail, called Pacific Crest trail, is under the shadows of a mountain that is blocking your view of Rainier.  Even though it was 80M-0 out, there were large patches of snow everywhere.  We didn't know we would be walking through snow, so we didn't bring anything to slide on.  To compromise, we just sat down and slid on our butts.  Great fun, but the ice wedgies can sting.  We past a couple small ponds, too, which also made great pictures.  At the top of the climb the trail splits:  one way goes to Dewey Lake, the other way, we weren't sure.  Dewey Lake is pretty big, but it was getting late, so we took the trail that we hoped would lead us back.  Soon after the trail split, we were given the best photo op yet.  We came around the crest that was blocking our view and were presented with big green meadows in the foreground and Mt. Rainier in the background.  The reason the risk of taking that trail head paid off was because the rest of the way back, we had Mt. Rainier in front of us.  We made it back to the truck, put our muddy boots in the back and drove home.  Great trip.\n\n\n8/1/97\n\nI'm still working on improvements to DirectEditor.  It has really come a long way.  When the level designers aren't wrestling each other, they're playing with DirectEditor.  I love to insert some neat little feature and just put it on the net without telling anyone.  I stand back in the shadows as they uncover my little present.  The next thing for me to tackle is improving the resource management.\n\nAs far as DirectEngine, Mike and I have to make sure the physics is all things to all people.  Some games will require non-realistic physics, like lack of linear momentum, or wacky gravity.\n\n\n\n7/25/97\n\nI just moved up to Seattle 6 months ago.  To sum up my experiences so far:  the people are great, the scenery is beautiful, the rain is...er...wet, and DirectEngine ROCKS!\n\nHaving several games being developed using DirectEngine in-house really helps us keep it a great game engine rather than just a spin-off engine.  Riot, the first game developed with DirectEngine, is really looking sweet.  I can't wait until it's done and the multi-player rioting begins.\n\n\n"}, {"by": "bradc@stomped.com", "time": 878179140, "contents": "Login: bradc          \t\t\tName: Brad Carney\nDirectory:

business!\n\nRaven Software started back in 1990 with our first game Black Crypt on the good ol'Amiga back when four guys\ncould do a game. \n\nWe owe alot of people for helping us stay in business for this long. id software of course is the cornerstone\n to all of our games as well as Activision for acquiring us and being so generous with our budgets and equipment.\n\nThanks! \n\nBrian Raffel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 18th\n\nI have received over 200 emails with suggestions for SOF2 imput.\n\nThanks! \n\nThis will help us out alot in our proposal to Activision.\n\nSeems most would like to have all realistic military weapons and more GHOUL enhancements, which is\nexactly what we are thinking of.\n\nWe are also VERY proud and thankful that SOF is in the #2 slot for sales two weeks in a row!\n\nSOF is on track to be Ravens BEST selling title ever! Thanks to all who have purchased it.\n\nA lot of people wanted me to say hello to John Mullins but if you want to email him directly with comments\nor questions here is his email address he wanted me to give out\n\njohnfmullins@hotmail.com  \n\nPlease dont ask him to kill anyone he doesnt do that sort of thing. (now) =)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 13th\n\nJohn Mullins is at Raven Today!\n\nWe are in the process of proposing SOF2 and wanted Johns input on the mission/weapons ect.\n\nIf you have any solid suggestions for SOF2 send us an email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 9th 2000\n\nHey if there anyone who wants to fight some of us Ravenites in the SOF demo, Meet us tonight on \n\nRAVENSERVER at 5:30 PM CENTRAL TIME\n\nThere will be about 3-4 of us and we hope to win all top spots.\n\nI will be MARTEK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeb 24th 2000\n\nFor those of you interested - If you check out GameSpot's Designer Diary of SOF I posted a small story\non our meeting with John Mullins and what he did to help us on SOF.\n\nAlso, check out WWW.Planetsoldier.com and check out the hooded terriorist. \n\n\n\n\nFeb 16th 2000\n\nWow wouldn't you know - we are knee deep in trying to go gold with SOF and the S_ _ t hits the fan.\n\nThe cover is blow off SOF in the mushroom! Read the article to see what I mean.\n \nhttp://www.themushroom.com/mush0215/soffraud.html\n\nNow John Mullins has seen this and had this to say about it:\n\n\"Lee, eh?  You wouldn't happen to know his home address, would you?  Failing that, his license plate \nnumber?\"\n\nJohn\n\nNow Chia Chin Lee will not come out from under his desk and we still need to tweek some CTF sounds!\n\nPlease submit your sound design resumes to Kevin Schilder c/o Raven Software.\n\n\n\n\nBrian Raffel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 12th, 2000\n\nI just want to let everyone know that when I said the SOF demo should pass by QA on Friday that \nDOES NOT mean the demo will be out then.  Sorry if that was the conclusion that was made but we will post\na solid date very soon when we are SURE that it is done.  Meanwhile if you would like you can download an\nSOF desktop background we just finished if you like.  \n\nThanks!\n\nDownload the Desktop Wallpaper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 10th, 2000\n\nWell, The SOF Demo is looking VERY good and should pass through QA by the end of this week.  We will \nkeep you posted as to when you will be able to down load the demo and from what site.  The Demo will \ninclude one single player level and two multiplayer levels.\n\nI am also proud to announce that Raven Software will be doing a Playstation2 title, \nwhich will be announce in the near future.  We are very excited about venturing into the \nconsole market, particularly on the PX2.  We finally got all of our development systems and they \nare awesome.\n\nBrian.\n\n\n\nNovember 8th, 1999\n\nWow,\n\nWe did a little post about people coming to help test the SOF multiplayer OEM and we were over run!\n\nI feel VERY sorry if you were one of the people we had to turn away, but we could only had enough machines for\n30-40 people.\n\n >>>please email me at braffel@ravensoft.com and I will see that you are put at the top of the list for our \nnext testing session. (be honest!)<<<\n\nwe have learned that we will schedule people and not leave it open to first come first serve.  We just didnt think\nthat many people would show up.\n\n\n\nFor those that did come out THANKS! and email us with any comments of how to improve MP/weapons or any other \nsuggestions you may have.  Remember that what you played was an OEM version and of course only about half of \nthe weapons and items from the final game were there. We also will be testing the other type of game like\nassassin and team deathmatch soon.\n\nThanks!\nBrian Raffel\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 3rd 1999\n\nHey,\n\ncheck out the AVAULT Review of the SoF OEM!  \nIt's very well done and full of great info.\n\nI would like to point out to those concerned about \nthe respawning feature that the OEM is Pre-ALPHA and \nwe are still working out the kinks. Right now we have \nit set up so enemies only respawn in logical, high-traffic \nareas and not in dead ends.  They also spawn in ahead of you \nand not behind you 95% of the time.  In the full version there \nwill be an option to scale this back if it bothers you.\n\n\nBrian Raffel\n\n\n\n\nJune 24th 1999\n\n\n YeeeHAAAAA today is our nine year anniversary of being in business!  My brother Steve and I \noffically formed Raven Software in 1990 and have been lucky enough to beat the odds and stay in\nbusiness.  I would very much like to thank id software since with out them we would more than\nlikely not be here! Also, Activision for allowing us to become part of their great company.\n Well back to working on Soldier of Fortune, Eric Beissman and Scott Rice are waiting for me\n in a meeting.\n\n\nbrian\n\nPS- Sad to say that once again bob love has fallen to my mighty terran tanks.  I look forward to\nhis excuses in his plan file, hmmm, the planets were not aligned correctly or the sun was in my\neyes. =)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 22nd 1999\n\n\nOur new web site is up!\n\nPlease check it out at the same old www.ravensoft.com\n\nI have been told that my new picture looks like Mr. Clean.  I guess I need to get\nan ear ring....again.\n\nPS- I have now beaten Bob Love in our Favorite RTS 5-6 times....someone teach him to play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMarch 8th, 1999\n\n\n\n\tI am pleased to announce that Raven Software will be developing a\nStar Trek: Voyager game for Activision.  The title will encompass the \nattributes of both intense first-person shooter action and team oriented \ncombat, as you play the role of a security officer fighting alongside \nyour fellow security team members. \n\tDrawing from the rich Star Trek universe, we will be focusing \nour efforts into creating the most amazing first-person shooter yet, \nwith new and intriguing gameplay elements.  We are developing new AI \nand Scripting systems so that the NPC's and enemies will intelligently \nreact to their surroundings and situation.\n\tAt this time we are in the early stages of development and more \ninformation will be forthcoming.  \n\nLook for us showing this title at E3 in May!\n\n\n***************************************\n\n\n\n\nDec 15th 1998\n\nIT IS OUT!!!! \n\n\"BLACK CRYPT LIVES\"\n\nThat is right, we finally put out our first game from the amiga on the PC.\n\nIT was a labor of love working on our first title back in 1988.  It all\nstarted when my brother and I got our c64's and Amiga's.(I loved the Amiga).\nWe meet up with Rick \"SuperFly\" Johnson and Ben \"Guitar Player\" Gokey. My \nBrother Steve and I did all of the Graphics, Maps, and Sound effects!(ok,\nRick did one for the Skeleton Lord). The 4 of us worked on the game design\ntogether and put a demo out.  In 3 days we had 6 contract offers! We wisely\nwent with EA as the publisher and the rest was history.  One tidbit, at\nthe time we made this demo I was a high school computer art teacher and \ncross country coach....so to speed things along I bought my team pizza to\nin put all of our dungeon maps from paper form into our dungeon editor on the\nschool amigas!  Now that was a great labor saver!\n\nSo download the game demo at \"http://www2.ravensoft.com/crypt\"\n\nRemember that it is an old style RPG with mouse driven controls and may be \na little clunky...and that we only had a 64 color pal.\n\nLet me know what you think (unless you hate it!)\n\n\nDec 2nd 1998\n\n>>Heretic II  <<\n\nI want to go on record to say that in my opinion Heretic II is the best \ngame to date by Raven Software!  I am very proud of this title (first \nsince joining forces with Activision) because I feel we delivered a game \nwith solid addictive game play in both single and multi player.  I am \nalso pleased that we took the time to insure that Heretic II was a stable\n product that includes ALL of the editing tools and source needed to \nallow buyers to create with it what they wished.\n     It was a tough choice for us to try 3rd person but we really wanted \nto take a risk and venture out into new territory and I think it was \nworth it.  It really helps to see all of the top-notch reviews we are \ngetting for the game.  A lot of 9 out of 10's and above! We also got a \nhuge complement from Scott Miller at 3d realms.Thanks Scott!  Now I \nwonder what John R. thinks of Heretic II?  John?\n\tRaven is really striving to push into new areas while staying \ntrue to our POV standards.  One of our next titles \"Soldier of Fortune\" \n(SOF) is looking awesome!  It is such a blast working with real world \nweapons in real world settings. Fantasy is my true love but there is \nsomething about using a machine gun that can't be beat.  In SOF we have \nused motion capture for ALL the enemies and created a new technology \ncalled \"Ghoul\" which allows us to mix and match different attributes to \nenemies so that they each look very different from each other.  I have \nalways hated the cookie cutter feel of a horde of foes all looking like \nclones coming at you.  It is cool to see 10 different enemies attacking \n you in all different sizes and attire.  More on SOF another day and \ntalk of gore zones.\n\n\tI cannot wait to announce our third project but it should not \nbe too much longer.\n\nCompliments to Ritual on \"Sin\" and Valve on \"Half Life\" Both are Awesome \ngames!!\n\nBrian \"Martek\" Raffel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 26, 1998\n\nHERETIC II demo suggestion.\n\nJust wanted to point out what may be obvious to most players but a lot \nseem to miss this.  Since Corvus always has the Tome of Power with him \n]he has the ability to power up his weapons at ALL times. To do this \nrequires a large amount of defensive (blue) mana.  So, a good tip is to \npick up some blue mana and hit your defense key (usually the enter key) \nand power up your weapons...I strongly suggest using it with the red rain! \n\n"}, {"by": "brandon@epicgames.com", "time": 936043680, "contents": "Login: greenmarine    \t\t\tName: Brandon Reinhart\nDirectory: /home/greenmarine        \tShell: /bin/bash\nLast login Mon Jul 26 18:59 (EDT) on ttyp4 from 216.27.43.207\nMail forwarded to brandon@epicgames.com\nMail last read Fri Aug 20 17:58 1999 (EDT)\nProject:\nUnreal Tournament\nPlan:\nBrandon \"GreenMarine\" Reinhart\nUnreal Team Programmer\nEpic MegaGames, Inc.\n\nMonday, August 30, 1999\n\nAnswer for previous question:\n\nThree threads are normal, it seems.

Well there are a few ways to do it. Although all are different. \n\nThe easy way:\n Click on Start - Programs - MSDOS prompt. \n\nAlthough this is the easy way, none of Apogee/3D Realms games are\nsupported via this method, and a lot of times the game locks up or just will not run.\n\nNext way:\n\n Click on START - Shutdown - Restart in MSDOS mode. \n\nAlthough this is my preferred method of doing dos games, a lot of computer manufactures do not install any dos drivers into your computer so when you do this you do not have Sound, CDROM, or Mouse support. You only have what is installed on your main hard drive.  So for the Older games (Keen 1-3, Cosmo, ect.)  this is a good way of doing it, although for newer (Duke 3D, Shadow, TV)  Dos games this will not work.\n\nThe Best Way:\n\n  Create a short cut that restarts your computer into DOS and loads all the drivers that you need. \n\nThis way is what the rest of my .plan will be on. \n\n  To start out, you need all the dos drivers for your system. This includes the dos drivers for your Sound Card, Mouse and CDROM. There are so many sound cards I can not help you find the drivers for Sound card, although if you have a sound blaster or any card from Creative labs you can go to http://www.soundblaster.com and download them from there.  (For the rest of this file I will be using a Sound Blaster 16 as an example)\n\n For your mouse you can search your hard drive for a dos mouse driver\n (usually mouse.exe) or download one from the net. There is a lot of them out there and I can not tell you which one to choose, although the best way of doing this is for you to go to the web site of your mouse Manufacture and use the one that they recommend.\n\n Your CDROM will be the same way although there is one place that I recommend:\n\nhttp://www.gankish.net/rumblesoft/  (then click on CDROM GOD)\n\nThis is a link to the CDROM GOD. This is a boot disk that will install the dos drivers for your CDROM. This is a GREAT Util and every one should have this disk just incase. When you run it, copy over the drivers into a directory  that you can remember because we will need it later. \n\nNow to make the ICON. Right Click on your Desktop. This is done by pressing the Right mouse button when your mouse is not in any window or over any Icon. Select \"New\" and then Select \"Shortcut\" A window will come up and ask you what the command line is. You will need to type in COMMAND Then the next window will ask what you want to call it. You can call it anything you want. (Mine is called \"DOS GAMES\")\n\nNow you will notice that there is a new Icon on your Desk top. This is the Icon that we just created and this is also the one that we are going to make restart your computer. \n\nRight Click on the New Icon, and select Properties. Since we are going\nto make the computer restart The only thing that we have to worry\nabout is the PROGRAM tab. Click on that and then select Advanced. Click on the one that states: MS-DOS mode. Then Check Specify a new MS-DOS Configuration. You will notice that the 2 boxes for your config.sys and Autoexec.bat are now available.\n\nBelow is my Config.sys and Autoexec.bat that I use for dos games, Please remember that your drivers might be different and / or in a different location.\n\nConfig.sys:\nDOS=HIGH,UMB\nDevice=C:\\WINDOWS\\Himem.Sys\nDevice=c:\\windows\\emm386.exe\nfiles=30\nbuffers=20\ndevicehigh=c:\\cddos\\hit-ide.sys /D:mscd001 \n\n\nThe bottem line is the CDROM drive line. \n\nAutoexec.bat:\nSET PROMPT=$p$g\nSET winbootdir=C:\\WINDOWS\nSET LMOUSE=C:\\MOUSE\nlh C:\\logitech\\mouse\\MOUSE.EXE\nc:\\cddos\\mscdex.exe /D:mscd001 \n\nAs you can see I use Logitech's mouse driver and again the last line is my CDROM Drive line. (I have the drivers for the CD in the c:\\cddos\\> directory) the /D:mscd001 stands for the name that you are giving your CDROM drive. I use the default (mscd001) this does not really matter UNLESS you have it as /D:CDROM DO not name your cdrom this. Change it to something else if this is what you have as it can and will cause problems. \n\nI have left the Sound drivers out because mine will be different than yours, and there are so many ways to load sound drivers, you will need to refer to the install file that came with the DOS drivers that you downloaded in order to have them listed, although this is the screen that you will add them to. Once added click on \"OK\" then Click on \"OK\" again.\n\nNow you are ready to Click on the Icon and Run your Dos Program. It will ask you if you are sure that you want to restart in MSDOS mode, and once you press Ok you will be in dos with your sound cdrom and mouse all active.\n\nWhen you are done playing all you need to do is type in \"EXIT\" at the prompt and you will be taken back to windows. \n\n\nPersonal stuff: None  :) Been a slow couple of weeks\n\nGames that I am playing :\n \n  Single : Mech Warrior 3\n  Multi Player: Microsoft Hearts (Don't Ask) "}, {"by": "bshubat@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 1023745740, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Brian Shubat\nEmail: bshubat@ravensoft.com\nDescription: Animator\nProject: Jedi Knight2\nLast Updated: 06/10/2002 17:04:38 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6-10-02\n\nHmmm, yeah well, call me lame for not getting back to most everyone who has sent me demo material and/or r\u00d9\u0089sum\u00d9\u0089 in consideration for employment as a 3D Animator with Raven Software but I was deathly busy working on JK2 for the last year.

Applicants who know how to use 3D Studio MAX; Maya; Lightwave; Video Strudel; Milktoast; or other such 3D packages need not apply unless they too know how to use Softimage|XSI. Softimage|XSI know how, have you, must. There is no other reason for the requirement than the fact that we are working on a project that is using Softimage|XSI exclusively.

It's\npretty obvious from their numbers that the Rendition is pretty much fill\nlimited whereas the NVidia is host-limited.  This is good news for NVidia since\nthis means that tweaking their drivers will hopefully increase their numbers\nacross the board.\n\nJust for grins I ran the Rendition V2200 at 1024x768....I'm impressed that it\nworks at all, but I don't think people are going to be playing at that\nresolution with that performance anytime soon.\n\nAnd for those of you that are curious, the ATI Rage Pro 8MB MCD got 10.8 fps\nat 640x480 using their MCD on the Pentium II/200.  I'd have a hard time\nrecommending the ATI Rage Pro for Quake2 to anyone, unless you're going to be\nrunning in software.  I suppose it would be adequate if you had one already,\nwere running NT 4.0, and were willing to run at a low resolution.  I'm not\nsure what kind of performance gains they could realize with an ICD, but\noverall, I'd have to recommend just about any of the other boards we've\ntested over the Rage Pro.  HOWEVER, the Rage Pro does seem to have reasonable\nfeatures, so performance seems to be their primary killer more than anything\nelse.\n\nI'd also like to take the time to thank the hardware vendors that have been\nvery helpful by providing frequent driver updates, supporting OpenGL\npublically, and by providing as many loaner boards as possible.  These\ncompanies include 3Dfx, NVidia, STB (specifically Chris Cox, who constantly\nprovides us with tons of testing boards -- dude, you're the Man!), Texas\nInstruments (they provide us most of our Permedia2 boards), Rendition, and\nNEC/PowerVR.\n\nDecember 14, 1997\n------------------\n\nOkay, the questions have already started rolling in.  Some more data and\ncommentary for you:\n\n- \"SLI\" means \"scan-line interleaved\", i.e. two Voodoo (or Voodoo2) chipsets\nrunning in parallel, each of which is processing every other scan line.  You\ncan do this in a single board configuration (such as the Obsidian 100-4440)\nor you can do this with two boards connected by some ribbon cable.  Currently\nno consumer Voodoo boards support SLI out of the box, but supposedly Voodoo2\nboards WILL support SLI out of the box.\n\n- currently there is a throughput problem with the Voodoo2.  Well, it's not\nreally a \"problem\", it's more like a bottleneck at around 67fps, which is very\nhard to classify as a \"problem\".  This means that having a Voodoo2 in an SLI\nconfiguration doesn't make much sense unless you want to run fast high\nresolution modes like 800x600.  Currently there is no significant difference\nin performance between an SLI and non-SLI Voodoo2 configuration when runnning\nat 640x480 or lower.  HOWEVER, if it turns out that they're artificially\nlimited in throughput (poor drivers, early silicon, low-speed parts, whatever)\nthen there is a chance that the SLI will make a difference -- although I have\nno idea why you'd need to run > 60fps.\n\nOne possible explanation for the throughput problems is that Glide 2.x does not\nsupport strips and fans, and we rely on those heavily.  If Glide 3.x supports\nstrips and fans (and their OpenGL supports this) then throughput could nearly\ndouble since it will utilize the Voodoo2's on-board triangle setup engine very\neffectively.\n\n- the 2D card used with the PCX2 was an NVidia RIVA128 PCI.\n\n- I have no idea what the pricing is going to be for Voodoo2, other than it is\ntargeted at consumers, meaning that it probably won't cost thousands of\ndollars.\n\n- I have no idea when Voodoo2 will ship, so this may all be moot if they can't\nthis thing out the door on time.\n\n- the RIVA128 still has lots of room for improvement, and I'm sure that with\nappropriate driver optimizations that they are going to get quite a bit\nfaster.\n\nDecember 13, 1997 (part 2)\n------------------\n\nEvery now and then a beast walks the landscape and devours all within its path,\nknowing no natural enemy.  These are the things of legend: Michael Jordan,\nWalter Payton, the great white shark, early Mike Tyson, and...\n\n3DFX, ca. 1997\n\nI've said this before and I'll say it again -- I left 3Dfx for a reason, and\nit didn't have anything to do with wanting to branch out and expand my\nhorizons.  It had to do with the fact that I thought 3Dfx was confused and had\na severe lack of management and direction.  So when I say good things about\n3Dfx, it's not because I love that company or anything -- sure, I have some\nstock in 3Dfx, but the amount I have is a pittance (I negotiated poorly for\nstock, and I left after only 1/4 of it vested), so I don't have a financial\nreason to like 3Dfx.\n\nIf I say good things about 3Dfx, it's because their hardware rocks like no\nother hardware company can dream of.  I empathize with their situation --\nthey make what is  arguably the single most important piece of consumer PC\nhardware since the SoundBlaster, and all we keep hearing about are all the\n\"Voodoo Killers\" that are gonna show up \"any day now\".  I cannot stress to\nthe world what kind of an amazing achievement the Voodoo was/is -- it easily\nspanked it's nearest competitor by a factor of three, which is practically\nunheard of.  Typically when looking at performance claims between hardware\nit's impressive to see someone listed as \"25% faster\".  But THREE HUNDRED\nPERCENT?!\n\nThat, my friends, is amazing.  And yet at times I STILL think people are\nconstantly looking at the horizon wondering what's going to be the \"Voodoo\nKilla\", instead of appreciating the magnitude of what Scott Sellers, Gary\nTarolli, and Jim Margeson accomplished.\n\nid had to hear the same noise after Quake when all the \"Quake killers\" were\ngonna show up and even the landscape....sure, there were pretty screenshots\nand big performance claims and projected release dates, but when it came down\nto it, the first Quake killer to ship was...Quake 2.\n\nIt must be nice being a competitor of 3Dfx, since it's easy to aim for that\nplume of dust they're leaving in their trail.\n\n\"So, what's the big deal?\" you may ask.  Why the big 3Dfx Cheerleading all of\na sudden?\n\nTo answer that, let's just say \"I ran the numbers\".  But first, let us\nestablish some things:\n\n1.  The test system, as I mentioned the other day, is a pretty big, macked\nout, p1mped up system from hell.  It's an HP Pavilion 8190 Pentium 2/300 with\nAGP, 6GB HDD, some kind of soundcard (disabled for testing), etc. etc.  A\npretty nice system.  Oh, and 96MB of RAM.\n\n2.  Now, please do NOT send me mail whining that this system is not indicative\nof what everyone has.  I KNOW this already.  But if I test on a Pentium/200MMX,\npeople are gonna complain that they don't know what kind of p1mped out new\nsystem to get, or they'll complain that my test system should match our\nminimum requirements.  If I test on a P5/133, people are gonna complain, once\nagain, that they don't know what kind of NEW system to get, or they'll complain\nthat I'm testing CPU performance, not hardware performance.\n\n3.  Yes, certain accelerators are very dependent on CPU performance.  If I had\na P5/133, I would NOT get a PowerVR or a RIVA128 -- these two chipsets are\nreal dependent on CPU performance, more so than their competitors.\n\n4.  A Pentium 2 was pretty much needed because I wanted to test AGP parts along\nwith PCI parts.  Also, some chips like the RIVA128 are going out standard on a\nlot of Pentium 2 machines, so NVidia will have a (valid) argument that if I\ntest a RIVA on a P90 that this is NOT typical of a RIVA in the field.\n\nSo, I know I can't make everyone else happy, but I CAN make myself happy.  I'm\nsure other people will run the benchmarks on lower end systems and print their\nresults, so all is not lost.\n\n5.  These numbers, and chipset opinions, are GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE\nOF GLQUAKE.  This may seem like common sense, but I KNOW some people are going\nto whine that the numbers are lower than GLQUAKE's, so please...don't.  Also,\nthe performance dependencies of Quake2 are significantly different than that of\nGLQuake -- we have lots more triangles going on, and I believe a lot more\ntextures.  This means that boards that work great with GLQuake (e.g. PowerVR\nPCX2) aren't so hot with Quake2, and vice versa (Permedia2 is arguably a better\nboard for Quake2 than Quake because its triangle setup performance makes up for\nits poor fill-rate).\n\nTests were run 640x480 and 512x384, fullscreen, at 16bpp resolution, with\nsound disabled, using \"sync to retrace\" disabled if at all possible.  Tests\nwere run twice, and the best of the two scores was recorded.  I did not get\na chance to test the ATI Rage Pro because I don't have NT installed -- all\nthe more reason to see these guys support an ICD -- and I did not get a\nchance to test the Rendition V2100 boards since they don't seem to work with\nthe V2200 software Rendition provided.  I used DEMOMAP DEMO1.DM2 to run\nthe test.  I also did not exec ANY configs, since this can throw off figures\nif you inadvertently set \"hand 2\" or something.  All tests were performed\nunder Win95 OSR 2.1 with no other applications running.  Occasionally I would\nrun a test at higher resolution \"just because\".\n\nAs a \"control\" number I ran the test in software, fullscreen, using DirectDraw\non the Permedia2.\n\nNo overclocking of any type was done, and I did not run any \"tweaks\".  I'm\ntrying to represent the type of performance Joe User would get if he bought his\nsystem at CompUSA, grabbed some add-in board (if necessary), then went home\nand played.\n\n****************************************************\n* sorted alphabetically

town, the current one just\ngot a lot meaner.  Sure, the Voodoo2 4/4/4 SLI board isn't going to be that\ncommon -- but if you can afford one, you'll have performance at 1024x768 at\nalmost DOUBLE the nearest 3Dfx competitor's performance at 512x384.\n\nHow ya like them apples?\n\nAlright now, this is how this is gonna work.  First, all the news pages are\ngoing to post links, and eventually this plan file will be forwarded to all\nthe appropriate people at all the various hardware companies.  All the people\nthat are going to end up looking bad are going to bitch at me because of\nunfair comparisons, I didn't run on a slower machine, etc.  All the people\nthat are looking good are going to end up bitching at me because I didn't\nmake them look better.  Everyone is going to have nit picky gripes about\nmiscellaneous crap, including, I'm sure:\n\n\"we run faster in a window\"\n\"we run faster fullscreen\"\n\"we're scalable\" (i.e. we need a faster CPU)\n\"they're CPU dependent\" (i.e. they suck on slower CPUs)\n\"we support 24-bit\"\n\"they don't support 24-bit\"\n\"we have [insert feature here]\"\n\"we have better image quality\"\n\"you're using their beta drivers\"\n\"you're not using our beta drivers\"\n\n---------------------------------\n3Dfx Voodoo\n---------------------------------\nimage quality:\t\t\tgood (identical to Voodoo)\nperformance:\t\t\tvery good\nprice/performance:\t\tgood\nWinNT support:\t\t\tyes\nfull OpenGL ICD:\t\tno\n\nnotes:\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again -- look at the scores, and realize\njust how long ago this chipset shipped.  I'm still in awe.\n\nI didn't have a 4/2/2 so that I could run at 800x600.  When I get that I will\ntoss it into the mix.\n\nThe Canopus didn't show any significant performance increase, but this is\nbecause I'm measuring OVERALL performance, and I'm NOT measuring transient\nspikes in performance (i.e. stuttering).  We're looking into ways of measuring\nframerate consistency in addition to measuring average framerate.  The Canopus\nis still definitely a better board than the Monster3D -- that extra 2MB will\ngo a long way towards smoothing framerate, unfortunately that's simply not\ngoing to be quantified up very well under a TIMEDEMO benchmark.\n\nThat Quantum3D had decent performance, but definitely not enough to justify\nthe price.  Note that it didn't see a huge performance boost at 512x384 vs.\n640x480, indicating a throughput bottleneck of some type.\n\n---------------------------------\n3Dfx Voodoo2\n---------------------------------\nimage quality:\t\t\tgood\nperformance:\t\t\tinsane\nprice/performance:\t\tunknown\nWinNT support:\t\t\tyes\nfull OpenGL ICD:\t\tno\n\nnotes:\n\nOH MY GOD.\n\nFine, there were some visual glitches, but this is a pre-production board with\npre-production drivers, I imagine it's going to be a bit faster when it ships.\nI just hope they don't pull a Rendition and take 10 months to ship.  Notice\nthat going to SLI doesn't really buy you that much except higher resolutions --\nthey have so much fill rate that they are limited by throughput almost\ncompletely across the board.  On a the uber-Voodoo2 (4/4/4 SLI) there pretty\nmuch isn't a difference in performance when running from 512x385 to 1024x768.\n\n---------------------------------\n3Dfx Voodoo Rush\n---------------------------------\nimage quality:\t\t\tgood (identical to Voodoo)\nperformance:\t\t\tokay\nprice/performance:\t\tpoor\nWinNT support:\t\t\tno\nfull OpenGL ICD:\t\tno\n\nnotes:\n\nSetting gl_swapinterval did not result in any visible tearing, so either it is\nbeing ignored or they are triple buffering automatically (which would be cool).\n\n---------------------------------\n3DLabs Permedia2\n---------------------------------\nimage quality:\t\t\tpoor (no MIP-mapping, no colored lighting)\nperformance:\t\t\tokay\nprice/performance:\t\taverage\nWinNT support:\t\t\tyes\nfull OpenGL ICD:\t\tyes\n\nnotes:\n\nThis board is perfectly adequate for games and level editing, although it\nwon't excel at either.

I couldn't get 800x600 to work, but\nwhen I do I will put that number in -- I'll probably run a lot of these\ntests at 800x600 just to be complete.\n\n---------------------------------\nRendition V2200\n---------------------------------\nimage quality:\t\t\tgood (no per-pixel MIP mapping)\nperformance:\t\t\tgood\nprice/performance:\t\tgood\nWinNT support:\t\t\tyes\nfull OpenGL ICD:\t\tyes\n\nDammit, Rendition, when are you gonna ship this puppy?!  I am emphatically\nenthusiastic about this chipset, it's got great performance, and it's a fully\nintegrated part that does 3D-in-a-window really well.  It looks great, has\nawesome image quality, a full feature set (except for per-pixel MIP mapping),\nand in general just rocks.\n\nThese numbers are probably a little lower than they should be, since it looked\nlike syncing to vertical retrace was enabled and I don't know how to disable\nsync on the V2200.\n\nBut it ain't shipped yet. *sigh*\n\nDecember 13, 1997\n------------------\n\nDamn! Found a crappy bug with our GL_EXT_SWAPINTERVAL handling.  I have a chunk\nof code that basically does this:\n\nif ( gl_swapinterval->modified )\n{\n   UpdateSwapIntervalInTheDriver();\n   gl_swapinterval->modified = false;\n}\n\nThis works fine, until someone changes the video mode -- this causes the entire\nOpenGL DLL to be unloaded, and when it's reloaded the swapinterval isn't set\nappropriately, so if I ever did this:\n\n]gl_swapinterval 0\n]gl_mode 2\n\nThe value of \"gl_swapinterval\" would not be set after the mode switch.  Irk.\n\nI'm extremely glad I found this bug though, otherwise all my numbers on 3Dfx\nwould have been suspect.  Whew.\n\nAny IHVs that have NOT implemented the swapinterval extension -- I'm BEGGING\nyou to!  Please, it REALLY makes benchmarking a lot easier.\n\nDecember 12, 1997 (part 2)\n------------------\n\nDidn't get much done today, spent most of today messing around with a brand\nnew HP Pavilion 8190 system.  Man, a few years ago computers like this simply\ndidn't exist -- fast, well built, well designed, easy to setup, and cheap.  It\ncomes with a big fat color poster showing how to put it together, and it has\nEVERYTHING included -- Pentium II 300MHz, 32MB RAM, fax/modem, ATI Rage Pro w/\n4MB of RAM (AGP), 6GB IDE HDD, the works.  And it cost $2700 w/o monitor.  Oh,\nit also has a DVD-ROM 2x driver, and it includes a nice set of Polk Audio\nspeakers with a subwoofer.  Dig this -- the keyboard has CD-player controls\non it, and you can hook up the modem so that your computer does voice mail and\nacts as a speakerphone.  Wow.\n\nThe only thing missing was a network card, which was easily rectified by\nslapping an Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 PCI in there.  It took me over an\nhour to figure out that it was the \"B\" model, not the \"A\" or \"C\" model, and\nafter that it was on the network.  The system only has Win95 OSR 2.1 installed,\nand I'm not going to risk angering the Gods of Computer Moodiness by installing\nWindows NT on it -- so no MCD scores (the only losses here will be Intel i740\nscores -- which we're not allowed to print anyway, and ATI Rage Pro MCD scores)\nbut this isn't that big a deal, since MCD is officially dead-ola.\n\nSo I stick in the Rendition V2200, and it finally came up and worked like a\ncharm, and damn does it look GOOD.  Fast, good quality output, no glitches,\nno problems.  People are gonna dig it.  The PCX2, unfortunately, installed\nokay, but PVRGL.DLL wasn't loading. *sigh*\n\nTests are going to be 640x480x16bpp, fullscreen only.  Benchmarking takes up\nWAY too much time, and as much as I'd like to get scores for P5/133, P5/200MMX,\nPPro/200, and P2/300, I only have time to do one system, and that's gonna\nbe the high end.\n\nHere's the justification: I realize that the vast majority of users out there\nhave lower end systems, but right now I'm trying to figure out which GRAPHICS\nACCELERATOR is the best, not which SYSTEM is the best.  We all know that some\naccelerators are simply going to fall apart on low end systems -- the RIVA128\nand PCX2 both come to mind, since they are both heavily CPU limited.  But the\nfact is I want to determine what is the BEST Quake2 accelerator out there, and\nthat means removing the CPU as a measuring parameter.\n\nSo tomorrow I'm going to try and finish out all the scores and write something\nup.  Tonight I got V2200 and RIVA128 numbers, tomorrow I hope to do...well,\neverything else.\n\nDecember 12, 1997\n------------------\n\nCyrix sent word to us that we were apparently NOT keeping the system in\n24-bit precision all the time (they also pointed out a bug where I was\nsetting the FP control word to 807f instead of 087f...whoops).  So anyway\nI investigate this somewhat, and find that for some reason every time we\ncall LoadLibrary that the FP control word gets reset to 027f!  What's up\nwith that?  I'm not ruling out a bug on my end, but there's nothing\nobviously screwed up on our end, so maybe this is some known behaviour of\nLoadLibrary?\n\nWill investigate more.\n\nDecember 11, 1997 (part 3)\n------------------\n\nI will probably write up my lecture at UF and post it, so if you live in\nBurkina Faso (or Alabama, same thing :-) ) you don't have to drive all\nthe way to see what mindless crap I ended up sputtering.\n\nA reminder: it will likely NOT be a technical discussion, it's going to\ncover mostly stuff about having a career in the computer industry.  At\nthe end there will be a QA session where we can talk tech if you want, but\nthe actual \"Brian Standing In Front of a Crowd and Rambling\" portion is NOT\ngoing to discuss coding, optimization, graphics, or anything like that (other\nthan the parts that pertain to being successful).\n\nThink of it as a Tony Robbin's speech given by some half-Asian dude who works\nat id software.\n\nToday's Soundgarden lyrics:\n\n\"Down in the hole,\n Jesus tries to crack a smile,\n beneath another shovel load\"\n\nAnecdotal Rambling: The VAX\n\nLet me tell you about a pseudo-online subculture that existed before the\nWeb was invented.  It was called \"The VAX\", and it resided in CSE 211 at the\nUniversity of Florida.  It was a big ol' mainframe running DEC's multi-user\noperating system, VMS (5.4 if I recall), and you logged into it through one\nof a bunch of VT-220 terminals sitting in a HUGE computer room.  This was\nback when computers were networked using ArcNet, and the other half of the\nlab consisted of IBM PC XT machines with dual 5.25\" floppy drives.\n\nThere was actually more than one VAX -- there were MAPLE, PINE, ELM, and\nCEDAR.  But you only logged onto anything but MAPLE in the direst of\nemergencies since the other systems were so damn slow.  Any student with\na valid ID could get a user account and 300 blocks of disk space (I think\na block was 512 bytes, but I don't remember now).\n\nI messed around with the VAX quite a bit, learning some C programming, and\nI also learned a bit of DCL, a REXX-like scripting language.  But the\ninteresting thing about the VAX was that it had a complete subculture of\npeople with nicknames, process names, message boards, and utilities like\nICQ (\"send\") and IRC (\"phone\").  These people were, invariably, freaks, and\nI was one of them.  The people that inhabited this system included SORROW,\nLIONESS, WINTERMUTE, SCRIB, CENOBITE, TIPMO, ENTERPRISE, JIAN, PETRA, RABBIT,\nINFINITY, TRUFFLE, and a host of others.  You could log in and run a command\nto see who was logged in and on what terminal (\"J-11\" would be someone on the\n11th terminal on Row J) and, if you were hard up, you could see if that person\nwas a chick and if they were hot, and if so, you could start anonymously\nsending them messages to get to know them.  You could set your self into\n\"nobroadcast\" mode, meaning that people would not be able to send you a\nmessage, and you could also set your process name to some message that\nestablished how cool and deep you were.\n\nPathetic, I know, but that's computer culture for you.\n\nUnfortunately, there just wasn't a whole lot to do on the VAX.  You could talk\nwith others, but most of the time these were people that were sitting two rows\naway from you, so what was the point?  I used the VAX to learn programming and\nalso because it was located centrally to all the classes that I was busy\nnot attending. :-) It was also nice to send e-mail from the VAX -- this was\nback in 1990 when e-mail hadn't really become the ubiquitous thing it is today,\nso most of the time you ended up sending e-mail to people two seats away, but\nhey, it was pretty cool anyway.\n\nIt was from a VAX account that I sent my very first e-mail to Michael Abrash\nas an id groupie.  Heh heh.\n\nOther VAXers would use it for its telnet capabilities to get into MUDs and\nMOOs; some would use it to telnet to the big IBM mainframe (NERDC) on campus\nor to the Unix workstations upstairs; yet others used it for FTP and GOPHER.\n\nThe other interesting thing is that most of the VAXers were NOT hardcore\ncomputer freaks -- they were mostly people using it for social reasons, not\nbecause they were programmers.  The REAL hackers were hanging out on the third\nfloor using Sun 3/60 and Sun 3/80 machines and, if you were REAL cool, a\nSun SparcStation (\"lightning\" was the first one UF received, if I remember\ncorrectly).  See, REAL computer users used SunOS (and thought Solaris was the\nspawn of Satan).  The VAX was for rejects that didn't have the clout to get\na Unix account...heh.\n\nI'll tell you, I really miss the good old days, back in college when you had\nfew responsibilities but to pass the occasional class and mostly hang out\nwith friends.  I used to hang out with my friends Oz and Taco until 6AM\nwatching movies we'd seen a million times before.  We'd drink, party, talk\nabout each other behind each other's backs, fall in love with each other's\ngirlfriends, do stupid shit like that, and That Was Cool, because it was\na part of growing up.  When your only responsibility was to survive until the\nnext day and, hopefully, not get thrown out of school.  This was the brackish\ntime between being a kid and being an adult -- being old enough to really\nreally screw up, but young enough to recover.  Old enough to live away from\nthe parents, but young enough that you didn't have big car payments or\nmortgage payments and it was really a trauma if your folks didn't pay for\nyour car insurance.  Back when you were trying to create your own identity,\nbut had the safety of your bedroom back \"home\" in case you created something\nthat sucked.  Back when you were busy proving to each other that you really\nwere independent, not just living away from home.\n\nThen one day you grow up, and \"home\" ISN'T where your parents are, and your\nold bedroom is now your Mom's den that has their new computer.  You find\nout that you have mortgage and car payments, and you actually make Big Life\nDecisions without even thinking about asking your parents approval.  You move\nacross the continent without telling anyone or asking permission, and you\nsuddenly have responsibilities.  You now have a job where if you screw up\nand don't finish your work you actually GET IN TROUBLE, as opposed to just\nfailing and signing up for a new one by filling out the appropriate bubble\nsheet.\n\nThen one day it's no longer a big deal when you can buy booze, because everyone\ncan tell you're over 21, then the next day you realize you're closer to 30 than\nyou are to 20, and that punks in the mall don't even see you because you're\nAn Adult now instead of One of Them.  People call you sir, and when you're smart\nand successful it's expected instead of \"Oh wow, you are gonna go far someday\",\nbecause you're now old enough where if you haven't made it, you may never make\nit.  You soon reach the point where you're no longer full of potential --\nyou're either a loser or you're not.\n\nGrowing up sounds fun when you're younger, but I'd give it all up to be back\nin school, broke and not giving a shit, staring at the universe around me in\namazement and awe.\n\nChrist, alright, didn't mean to get all morose there....\n\n"}, {"by": "bwh@idsoftware.com", "time": 928283520, "contents": ", id Software, Programmer\nbwh@idsoftware.com, (http://www.idsoftware.com)"}, {"by": "bwhite@ionstorm.com", "time": 904232040, "contents": "\n*** Ion Storm's Finger Server\n\nUser name: bwhite\nPlan modified: Fri Aug 21 02:16:16 1998\n\nPolitcal stuff first...then gaming\n\nUS Teaches the World a Lesson Again.

It'll give all the mappers a good\nchance to play test their prospective WOS CTF maps with the real deal,\nand everyone else will be able to play and get bored of the few maps\nthat I've converted as testing grounds.

So, I decided to add \"one last feature\" that\nhad been suggested by someone (don't even remember who now) and\nseemed like a good idea.\n\nYou can now set a \"warm up time\" for a server, both regular DM and CTF.\nYou just set the cvar \"resettime\" to the number of seconds for warm up,\nand the server resets the time, scores, and players (making them\nrespawn) so that people who take longer to reconnect to a server after\na map change don't have to worry about P2 on a T1 equiped players\nalready having captured their flag before they've even spawned. Another\nbonue is that it gives everyone some time to get oriented to the new\nmap and get on the correct team before the game actually starts. And\ndon't worry and the runes and flags, they're reset along with\neverything else. It's like reloading the map without the load time. ;)\n\n<=====================================================================>\nDa Yakity Shmakity of Saturday, jul. 24, 1999\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThought I'd update everyone today since I probably won't be later on\nthis weekend, and because I've finished everything that you would find\nat all interesting to read about. :p\n\nI got an early start on the weekend and have already finished off\nadding the final code addition: Spawn Runes. :) Server's can now\nspecify to have all players spawn with a rune of their choice, making\na kind of super powered CTF, hehe. I thought it was just a silly idea\nat first, but then I thought about times when the only five runes are\nall on the other team and the runless side's getting totally\nslaughtered. We'll see just how well it pans out when everyone gets a\nchance to play with it. Everyone could select a rune benifical to\ntheir role on the team and would kinda introduce a toned down version\nof having different character classes.\n\nSorry about rambling on a bit much about it, but I'm just really\npsyched right now about how unexpectedly well I got the whole system\nworking. :D\n\nAll that's left is to get one last map WOSified (converted to WOSCTF),\nsound effects, a few rune models, and general clean up. After that,\nwe're clear for take off. ;)\n\n<=====================================================================>\nDa Yakity Shmakity of Sunday, jul. 18, 1999\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWork on WOS CTF has been getting annoying... been doing alot of the\ncrappy to do but quite necessary things like making and fixing up\nmenus and level load screens for highg and low res. The odd thing is\nthis, I was in the mood to do this stuff when the weekend started. I've\nsnapped out of it and don't know what had come over, but it doesn't\nmatter 'cause it's all finished now. *whew* |-)\n\nAfter I got the afore mentioned done, I started work in the new\ntech runes. I've got give two thumbs up to Ritual here, because it's\nbeen so ungodly easy to add in the new runes code! Woho! :) Anyway,\nthe new runes that you can look forward to loving and/or hating are\nas follows:\n\nFast Grapple - Makes you're grappling hook shoot out and real in much\nfaster than normal. Also, you don't take falling damage. (found to be\nnecessary after splatting myself against walls I grappled to several\ntimes while using this rune, hehe)\n\nVampire - When you damage someone, you get some of the damage you dealt\nback as health. It was requested several times when I was taking\nsuggestions, and it seems to be a nice counterpart to the empathy rune.\n\nSplash Shield - This rune will protect against splash damage, requiring\nthe use if a bullet weapon to effectively kill the owner of it. It will\nstill let about 1/10 of the damage through, but that's enough to make\nall explosives except the nuke (which still might be survived) pretty\nmush pointless.\n\nAmmo Vortex - This rune is best described as regeneration for you ammo.\nAs long as you have this rune you will continually recieve more ammo\nfor your current weapon. The speed that you recieve ammo at will depend\non what weapon you're using, so the asault rifle would accumulate ammo\nlike crazy, while the nuke would only get one ammo every several seconds.\nIt'll also increase the max amount of ammo you can carry, just as regen\nincreases your max amount of health.\n\n<=====================================================================>\nDa Yakity Shmakity of Sunday, jul. 11, 1999\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSmall update on the status of Sin CTF. I've just finished two\nimportant additions to the code.\n\nFirst, the anti-nuke-zones in which a nuke ball can not explode to\nfull potential, but it would still make a Thrall Ball jealous. These\nare going to be placed in the main flag holding bases of each CTF\nmap to prevent whole-sale nuking of entire flag defense forces.\nIt'll still take out anyone near it when it blows, but it won't be\nable to clear an entire flag room. Sorry nuke lovers, but you know\nthis is necessary for game balance.\n\nSecond, I've added a server cvar called ctf_runeflags which allows\nservers to dissable any and/or all runes in CTF games. In my\ncollection of input on some good ideas for new runes, several stated\nthat they'd love it if I removed a certain rune, mostly the empathy\nrune. I didn't want to totally remove a rune that many actually like,\nwhile ignoring the fact that other still disliked other runes, so I\nadded this in to let everyone decide for themselves. It'll even\nmake members of RHA (Rune Haters Annoymous) happy since they can\neasily just dissable all the rune.\n\nBefore you ask: Yes, I'm working on a Sunday night, I have no life,\nand you all can bite me... so there! Or you can just sit there\nbewildered at how someone like me could like (let alone survive)\nthis job while maintaining any semblance of mental or verbal\ncoherance at all (although some would say that statment has\nquestionable truth value) and just be thankfull that am and like\ndoing this stuff. Good night, and this is Geneneral WarT's brain\nsigning out saying, \"WTF is going on here!?!\"\n\n<=====================================================================>\nDa Yakity Shmakity of Tuesday, jul. 7, 1999\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAlright, I realize that I haven't updated my .plan in a while, and the\nprevious state in which I left it apparently frightened many people as\nto the future of WOS CTF. Ritualistic and Sin Post have mentioned my\nresponces to their inquries into this, but I thought I'd let you all\nknow myself and add in some additional info as well... just because\nI can. ;)\n\nThe first public beta will be released in just a few more weeks. It's\nnot really all that long considering how long you've waited already. ;P\nI've still gotta clean up the code for the new runes, get the anti-nuke\nzones working just right (to prevent reckless nuking of flag rooms), get\nsome arrangements going for test servers, and get someplace setup for\nbugs to be reported to. Whew...\n\nIn other news, Mechwarrior 3, Descent 3, and Worms Armageddon (basically\nWorms 3) are all out, so get them all or suffer the conciquences!\n\nAlso, never get a Squirrel as a house pet, cause it'll make a mess of\nthe whole place.\n==========\nAccount Name:  bigfour18\nEmail address: carl@bigfourfoundries.com\n----------\nCustomerID: 11808\n==========\nAccount Name:  horizon1\nEmail address: carl@horizoneng.com\n----------\nCustomerID: 18224\n==========\nAccount Name:  mktooling4\nEmail address: carl@mktooling.com\n----------\nCustomerID: 9227"}, {"by": "cbruce@ionstorm.com", "time": 991336800, "contents": "\n*** Ion Storm's Finger Server\n\nUser name: cbruce\nPlan modified: Thu May 31 15:23:50 2001\n\nChristopher L.

Those guys work hard to make sure everyone's got lots of nifty neato custom player models for their favorite games and is generally considered one of the best places for people interested in making cool shit for games to go and hang out.\n\nSo stop by and pick up a new ride for your favorite game.\n\nApril 3, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nGot my very own copy of Black and White in yesterday (didn't post it yesterday because I was too busy playing the thing) and it is by far one of the best games I've played in YEARS.  If this sucker doesn't take every single award that comes up, I'll know it's because the winner paid a substantial fee for said award.  Except for PC RPG of the year, which will go to Anachronox unless Neverwinter Nights makes it out this year, in which case, it's anyone's ball game.\n\nThe gestural commands are something I've wanted to see in a game for a long time, and they've implemented it very well.  It's not completely necessary to master them, you can get along just fine without ever having to use them at all...but damn if they aren't a convenient shortcut and an extremely good way to physically involve the player in the game playing experience.  I suspect we'll see more of it soon, and I know of one RPG game in development that uses a gestural command system for drawing the runes of spells.  I hope its not abused and used properly\n\nThe creature avatars are absolutely endearing and highly addictive to play with and train.  I have a happy tiger running about, eating sheep like a mad fool...and he's getting quite portly.  Haven't mastered his toilet training...silly bugger wants to poop on trees instead of in the crop fields like I try to get him to.  And he ate our beach ball.  He's a greedy bastard.\n\nGet this game.  No questions...you must own it.  I now have the unfortunate dilemma of splitting my time between FF9 and B&W\n\nMarch 28, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nJon Galloway's a bastard!  He stole my copy of Black & White!!!\n\nJust kidding...hope he didn't get one of those messed up copies.\n\nMarch 28, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nAbout 30 minutes ago, I call EBX at the North Park Center, inquiring as to whether or not they have copies of Black & White in stock.  Imagine my surprise, when I was told they did indeed have a few copies in.  I asked if they could reserve one for me, as I was on my way down (a mere 10 minute drive from the Ion tower)  \"No can do,\" I was told.  Bummer.  Well I'll hustle down there and hopefully they'll still have a copy left to purchase.\n\nI get there in record time, approach the salesman, and ask, \"Black & White?\"\nTo which he responds, \"Your name?\"\nThis puzzles me, and I ask him, \"Why do you need my name?\"\nHe looks taken back for a second then coolly replies, \"Do you have a copy reserved?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"We just sold out.\"\n\"But I just called, and you said you had some copies.\"\n\"We JUST sold out.\"\n\nI wonder if I could have used my \"illustrious status\" as a professional to get the guy to set one aside for me.  Somehow, I don't think it would have worked...but it might have been worth a shot.\n\nSo, I'm a very sad and disappointed developer, and I was daydreaming about playing a game where I could literally spank my monkey the whole trek to North Park.  Thank god for the internet though...I now have a copy of Black & White on it's way direct from Ebgames.com, which should be in my hot little hands by the end of the week.\n\nThere was a moral to this story, but it's escaped the author's mind.\n\nMarch 27, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nFinally picked up Final Fantasy 9, and it's fantastic.  I was disappointed with some of the more cumbersome aspects of FF8, and I'm extreme Ely pleased to see that they didn't carry them over into 9.  The game play is solid, art direction and style is superb, and the FMV is phenomenal.  If you haven't picked it up yet, go get it now...it's down to $39.99 and well worth that price.\n\nGot into a discussion the other day on the Polycount message boards about the importance of \"drawing\" skills when judging an artist candidate.  If you've something to contribute, hop aboard at http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~polycount/ubb/Forum1/HTML/002618.html and share your opinions, call me an idiot, whatever...\n\nMarch 12, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nOk...this is a good one.  My first \"real\" job was with a company in Russellville, Arkansas.  This particular company was started by a couple of college computer science major type guys who were using 3D Studio R3 to make spinning shiny logos for car commercials.  They quickly moved on to making full car commercials (now they make furniture commercials that look like car commercials).  Most of our work there was bad.  Not because I sucked, or the people I worked with sucked, but mostly because our clients were used car dealers.  The only thing worse than having to deal with used car dealers is having to work FOR used car dealers.\n\nAdd to that mix one ex-used car dealer turned salesman who somehow managed to convince the two guys who started the business that he should be in charge, and hence appointed himself manager/salesman. (*cough...ass...cough*)\n\nThe work was crap, the pay was crap, and needless to say, after 4 years of that I was eager to get a job in the game industry.\n\nMy buddy, unfortunately, is still stranded there...plunking away making car commercials...er, furniture commercials I mean.  (I keep forgetting that manager/salesman managed to piss off all the car dealers not only in the area, but also in the entire states including and surrounding Arkansas and promptly moved on to pissing off all the furniture dealers.)\n\nANYHO...my buddy sends me this (http://www.polycount.com/cottages/wrath/cartoon_concept.txt) today, which is the latest greatest idea for...hell, I dunno what you'd even call this.  But the managerman offered Cliff (That's my stranded buddy's name) a sizable offer of $1500 or possibly $3000 to see this gem of creativity to fruition.  He first showed it to Stephen, another worker there who told him that \"Cliff would laugh at him.\", which he indeed did.  After Cliff wisely passed on the chance to work on this masterpiece, he asked that Cliff pass it along to yours truly in the hopes that I and/or the company I work for might be interested in doing it.  Keep in mind that this project would be due in little over 2 weeks, and would pay about $3k-$5k\n\nThe point is...if someone out there is looking for a 3D modeler/artist type, working with 3D Studio since release 4, get in touch with Cliff Brannon (cliff@planewalker.com) get him to send you some examples of the type of stuff he can do while working in a complete and total creative vacuum of a company and GET HIM THE HELL OUT OF THERE AND WORKING FOR A REAL COMPANY.\n\nIf however, for some reason, you'd love the chance to work on the April High Point Awards Banquet cartoon, contact Cliff and he'll put you in touch with the appropriate people.  Tom Hall recommend sock puppets =)\n\nMarch 09, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nMax 4's new camera based multi-pass motion blur and depth of field totally rock!  You go Discreet! =)\n\nMarch 06, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nGot a pretty huge response from what I put in my plan yesterday...didn't realize I'd be garnering such a big audience.  Most people who wrote me generally agreed with what I said, so if I am a moron, then I've got plenty of brethren. ;)\n\nHad a few interesting counterpoints sent my way, including one from Scott who pointed out that legalization of narcotics was considered during the Reagan administration, but that the cost would have actually been higher than continuing the war.\n\nI believe that in some European countries (Amsterdam?) drugs, or at least some drugs, are legal.  Anyone have specifics about this and how it affects things like crime, addiction, and all of that other nasty stuff associated with illegal substance abuse?\n\nMarch 05, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nWent and saw \"Traffic\" last night, my general feeling about the movie was that they'd tricked me into paying $7 to watch a PBS after school special about drug trade.  I felt the message was that a war on drugs dealers is futile.  We should be fighting a war on the drug users.  They did some nice things with a different visual style for the 3 separate storylines, and none of the performances were weak, but the pace was agonizingly slow.  It was an informal film, but not terribly entertaining.\n\nI'll probably get lambasted for saying this, but I sometimes feel we'd be much better off by legalizing drugs. I'm reasonable enough to admit that there's no possible way to ever keep people from abusing any drug, whether it's legal like alcohol or tobacco, or illegal...people will continue to use.  By putting them under strict government regulatory controls just like over the counter medicine or even food for that matter, we'd eliminate the need for dealers and a lot of crime right off the bat.  You then take the billions of dollars spent on trying to stop drugs from getting in to the country or prosecuting dealers, and put that into treatment, and more importantly prevention.  I admit, it's a radical solution, but maybe that's what we need.\n\nI'm sure there are many reasons why this is a bad idea, and I'd love to hear them...so feel free to email me your thoughts.\n\nOn a lighter (and hopefully more game related) side, I'm in the process of jotting down notes about things that I find important when creating game art...whether it be modeling, mapping, or animating (I don't skin, so go bug someone else about that)  When I feel I've got enough, I'll probably organize them into something that will hopefully give some people a new perspective on some things.  These won't be full blown tutorials, or package specific (Yeah! Go 3DS Max, you rule!), more along the lines of, \"Hmmm...that's something to thing about.\"\n \nFeb 27, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nI'm in search of a plugin, script, or even process for Max 4 that will either export each frame of an animated mesh (Character Studio and Physique) to a sequence of .3DS or .ASC files.  I can do it by hand by making snapshots of the model and exporting each one individually, but it's a bit of a pain.  Ideally, I'd like to be able to push a button and tell it to export every Nth frame.  There were a few things for Max 2.x that I used to use, but none of them have been updated. Anyone have any suggestions?\n\nI've using 3D Exploration (which is a very nice program, similar to PolyTrans, it will read/convert many different 3D and 2D file formats.  http://www.wdsoft.com/explorer/) to convert models from a Max format to .LWO, and it's working beautifully...which is a treat as converting between 3DS and Lightwave is usually a nightmarish process for some reason.  Nice program guys, keep up the good work.\n\nFeb 26, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nHad to trim a few things from my plan as they were inappropriate...goes along with my need for the \"Plan files for Dummies\" book's Chapter 2, \"What NOT to put in your plan\"\n\nWell, I now have a plan file viewable from the web; joy, rapture.\n\nA big thanks to Richard Smith and Adam Coyne for adding it to the finger searches at webdog.org and planetquake.\n\nAnachronox continues to progress at it's staggering pace, and the team is VERY close to being able to fully play through the game.  The content has been there for a while, it's just being all stitched together.  I'm looking forward to being able to play through it myself, I've always been a big fan of the Square RPGs and Anachronox seems to have a very similar flair to it, but with a very Western attitude.\n\nI continue to explore the wonderful world of patch modeling in 3DS Max, I'm really going to push for full patch model support for GameX, as I think it's the absolute ideal solution for game geometry.\n\nFeb 25, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nMakin' a plan file's not as easy as I first thought it might be.  Sure, this typing stuff up part's a snap.  It's just a text file in a folder on one of our network machines...but after that, there seems to be some mysterious process involved in letting people on the web know it's there for them to read through.  And where the hell are the \".plan Files for Dummies\" books?\n\nI've been playing around with patch modeling in Max, and I must say it is exactly how I envision the ideal modeling solution for game art, especially using splines and the surface modifier.  Many years ago when I was first hearing about NURBS, I hoped they would work like spline modeling does now.  Unfortunately, they don't quite work that way.\n\nMy only complaint about the surface modifier is its inability to generate a patch surface using any number of points instead of needing to make a 3 or 4 sided patch.  I understand why it needs to, but still something that I would really like to see happen someday.  That and some better bezier manipulation tools for 3D spline shapes (which aren't terribly bad now, just a bit confusing at times) would make for an incredibly nice way of making models.  I highly recommend 3D artists take a look at patch models.\n\nOn a side note, the mysterious \"Max crashes when loading some scenes\" mystery has been solved.  It seems some strange option had gotten turned on in the preferences of the OpenGL display driver that the Matrox card did not like at all.  Whenever it would try to display a texture in a viewport, Max would crash to the desktop...so loading a scene that had a texture set to visible in viewports would naturally crash Max.  I turned of the silly thing and it works all fine and dandy now.\n\n\nFeb 22, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nI'm sure a lot of people have seen the GForce 3 video, demonstrating its power at work on the Doom3 code.  I've seen some of the more basic stuff before, when I was down for my interview here at Ion.  They've taken it even further since I saw it a mere 2 or 3 weeks ago.  I really believe that this type of graphic engine for games is going to revolutionize the way that developers approach creating them.  We're going to need people who have experience doing movies, set designers, lighting designers...outside of the level designer we have now.  It will be an interesting thing to see the game industry make that bridge between a game and a movie, since it will now be possible to create a visual experience that is for all practical purposes, cinematic work.  I've seen this sort of revolution coming to the industry for a while, but to be honest, it's happening much sooner than I once thought.  The game industry will very soon be going head to head against the Hollywood motion picture, and I honestly believe that we can take them.  We're capable of giving the audience a much more impressive experience, that's already a given...what's been keeping us from really hitting with the mainstream is the visual quality of that experience.  This new tech shows that graphic limitations will soon be a thing of the past.  And once this hurdle is overcome, we'll be able to go far beyond the scope of any movie...we can do things in the computer that are impossible to create in reality.\n\nVery, very exciting stuff!\n\nI'd like to give my congratulations to the most talented group of people in the industry over at id Software.  You guys are an inspiration to us all.  Only one question remains...\n\nWhere can I pre-order Doom3?\n\n\nFeb 12, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nFirst off, Happy B-Day to Ryan Butts (MrRogers) over at Sunstorm Interactive.  Mr. Butts turns a health 22 today I believe.\n\nMrs. Wrath and myself saw \"Hannibal\" this weekend, and I believe we are deeply entrenched in the \"hated it\" group of people.  The movie was extremely disappointing, I'm sorry to say.\n\n\nFeb 5, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nMoved in to the new pad this morning...Mrs. Wrath and myself realized that 99% of our furniture is cheap crap and we're now looking to replace all of it with lovely new furniture that wasn't bought from a store with the word \"mart\" in it's name.\n\nMax 4 has some very nice new features.  The most obvious, to me anyway, is the complete overhaul of the IK system.  Being a character studio fanatic, I have never used Max bones before and very rarely did I make my own IK skeleton using some boxes, heirchal linking, and a lot of fiddling about with Max's former IK.  From the very brief look at the new system, it seems much nicer.  The skin modifier has a very nice morph angle deformer that allows you set morph targets for parts of a mesh based on bone angles.  That gives you ultimate control of the shape of geometry, which is extremely cool.  That deformer on top of you standard bulge angle deformer and joint angle deformer makes for some very powerful and still very simple deformation setup.  Ton of other additions and changes to the package...for more info visit http://www2.discreet.com/products/d_products.html?prod=3dsmax\n\nA big congrats to Alphawolf over at Ritual, some of his Q3 models are included in the Discreet demo stuff on the Max 4 CDs.  Though for some odd reason, the scene with Shek causes Max to crash to desktop whenever I try to open it.\n\nCharacter Studio has gotten a few nice things, namely the selectable IK pivots for the feet and hands.  It makes freeform animations with IK blends for the feet much more flexible as well as allowing animating quadrupeds using a biped extremely easy and precise.  Haven't looked to much at the crowd feature, as I'll probably never use it, but it's closely tied to the new motion flow, which is still not done the way I'd like to see it done, but that's also something I very rarely use.\n\nCharacter Studio has gotten a few nice things, namely the selectable IK pivots for the feet and hands.

I was informed that Elizabeth Hurley and Matthew Perry were outside the chase towers earlier this afternoon.  I had to have walked right past them coming in, I was so busy gawking at all the cables and equipment everyone trying to figure out what was going on that I didn't even see them.\n\n\nFeb 2, 2001\n-------------------------------------\nFinally getting settled in here at Ion, arrived in the very large city of Dallas, Texas last Friday with Mrs. Wrath\n\nVery sad to leave Sunstorm, a lot of very talented folks hiding out there and I hope one day they'll get the chance to really shine.  I am extremely excited to be working at Ion, I think the companies poised to move out of it's somewhat dark history and really take center stage in the industry...something that you can see from Dues Ex and will soon see from Anachronox, which are both very fine games.\n\nCongrats to id Software on their 10 year anniversary.  I too, of course, was a big fan of all the id titles way back to Castle Woflenstein 3D all the way through Q3: Team Arena...played them all, loved them all.  I got a peek at some of the new tech that sick, sick bastard John Carmack is working on for Doom3 and it is going to be simply INCREDIBLE.  Couple that tech with the amazing pool of talent they have in their art department and there is absolutely no way they can lose.\n\nI am officially assuming the title of \"3DS Max Guru\" for Ion Storm, just got my copy of Max4 installed and am currently running through some of the new tutorials and such to find out what's really new, and what they just re-named and moved to a different menu.  One big thing I've noticed is that when importing older vers"}, {"by": "cchimes@mail.sec-net.com", "time": 900362220, "contents": "User:   cchimes\nRead:   0\nUnread: 0\nTime:   Mon, 13 Jul 1998 15:26:53 -0700"}, {"by": "cclee@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 949012860, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Chia Chin Lee\nEmail: cclee@mail.ravensoft.com\nDescription: Sound / Music\nProject: General\nLast Updated: 01/27/2000 18:13:28 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen implemented correctly, 3D audio adds a new dimension to the players' perception of the game world.  The graphics combined with spatialized audio add realism and immerse the gamers.  It is currently one of the most powerful tools for the sound designer.\n\nOver the course of Soldier of Fortune, I've dealt with mixing for both A3D and EAX, as well as the default sound settings in the game.  The future of 3D audio is promising, but like any technology in its infancy, it contains a few quirks.  Many of these problems are due to divergence of features and standards found in different soundcards and drivers.  This divergence can make the sound designer's job difficult in achieving a good mix balance between all the soundcard chipsets.\n\nI would love to talk to other developers to discuss your experience with 3D audio.\n\nThe problem is that I tweak all the audio under the Default sound settings, making sure that the attenuation, volume, EQ, etc, gel together as a whole.  Added on top of the mix is music.  This process can be quite arduous, especially in a non-linear medium such as games.\n\nAfter spending time to make sure the audio is perfect under Default sound, I switch to other 3D audio settings only to find the volume, attenuation, sound quality, etc, out of wack.  Although some of these issues are fixable, there are instances when changes in one area negatively alters other sounds.  In the end, I sometimes feel like I'm trying to make the \"least broken\" mix rather than the \"best sounding\" one.  \n\nBasically, 3D audio throws in a whole new dimension to the overall balance that \"distorts\" the raw sonic material I provide.  The only way to ensure the perfect mix is to design sounds that specifically cater to each unique type of audio implementation.  This is not currently a practical solution, unfortunately.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts concerning this issue, and how you overcame these setbacks...or if you even encountered these problems.  :)\n\nI must also take a moment to thank Keith Charley (and his excellent Eagle tool for EAX) at Creative and Micah at Aureal for all their help in implementing the 3D audio in Soldier of Fortune.  They are working hard to cater to our needs and constantly solving problems for us.

Developed by momma and poppa Spears, Britney is yet another installment in the famous one hit wonder chick club (including such greats as Tiffany and Debbie Gibson) and is designed to be the final word in just how much pop music horny 20-50 year old men will buy in the hopes that the pictures inside of their favorite lolita will be almost nude. Britney, who has been sent away for more breast manufacturing, is expected to be available on December 2, 1999 at a suggested retail price of... well... YOU can't afford her so don't bother.\n\nBritney is poised to take the world by storm with the most advanced 3-D enlargements and viciously satisfying \"gameplay\" to date. This pop icon features the quality and excitement of the music industry's past blockbusters along with more breast action, more heart rate raising intensity, and more argument for lowering the legal age of consent in states such as Texas.\n\n\"Britney goes beyond being an illegal sex object that we use to milk the masses of their money, and is a cultural phenomenon unto herself,\" said Justin Timberlake, Lipsynch master of 'N Sync. \"We at 'N Sync have been beta testing this product for quite some time now... and although we think we might have worn her out a bit (thus why she simply doesn't look as good now as she did in her school girl outfit) she still has plenty to offer the group of people who made her rich, and now they are legally allowed to admit they like her curved surfaces. Furthermore, the multiplayer action with Britney is just something that needs to be seen to believe. With the 5 of us at 'N Sync going at it each and every night, well... what can we say but WOW!\"\n\nBritney's enhanced chest displays realistic 3-D environments for you to bury your face in using advanced features such as curved surface rendering and high detail textures. Britney will amaze fans all over the world with visual features such as a nice booty, long firm legs and specular lighting from the sweat on her stomach after concerts and during photo shoots."}, {"by": "charliew@3drealms.com", "time": 973582680, "contents": "Account Name:  charliew\nEmail address: charliew@finger.3drealms.com\n----------\nOk... so let's say you are going to go watch \"Charlie's Angels\".\n\nA word of advice... if you go with somebody named \"Charlie\"... you are probably going to have to watch them very very closely.

I mean, to read it, how poorly it's written, the inaccuracies throughout it, the horrible excuse for journalism it is... I don't know whether to laugh uncontrollably or cry at the state of mainstream journalism.\n\nThe funny thing is that on sCary's messageboards someone who emailed the editor of this...ahem...newspaper posted the reply he received from the editor.  Basically the response was that the article was from a sister newspaper (in Toronto) and it was their intention to print a summary of it; checking the accuracy of the \"facts\" presented wasn't their job.  (no, unfortunately, I'm not kidding)  Er... hi.  Mr Editor, that WOULD be your job; well, yours and the editor of the paper from where the story originated.  \n\nThe term \"editor\" has never been more undeserved.\n\nSo the article itself uses a single EXTREMELY biased source and no follow-up to find out facts or an opposing view.  Real good reporting here kids.  This makes the Enquirer look like U.S News and World Report.  Probably one of the most disgusting bits of tripe ever to see newsprint.\n\nUpdate at 2:27 PM\n\nHow interesting.  It would seem the Ottawa Sun, in their infinite....er... wisdom pulled the article.

Congratulations, guys, on your appointment to the Thief 2 design team.  There's no doubt in my mind you guys will do great things.  ;-)\n\n- - - - -\n\nCOME WORK FOR US (05/18/99):\n\nWe are interested in hiring another level designer for the Daikatana team.  We want someone with hardcore mapping experience, be it amateur or professional.  If you're interested, please e-mail me and let me know what you've done.\n\n- - - - -\n\nMORE DEEP THOUGHTS, SATURDAY, 05/15/99:\n\n3-D Level Design, Lesson One:  \"Remember to put some things in front of other things.\"\n\nIt\n\nis\n\nso\n\nquiet\n\nhere.\n\nEveryone's away at E3, and it's been eerily quiet.  Haven't had a lot of feedback from \"the field.\"  I spoke briefly with Josh Jay, who spoke briefly to someone else who said, \"Everyone's loving our booth.\"  YES!!!  Time for that six-pack!  ;-)\n\nAnyway, we're showing a lot of cool stuff at E3.  Lots of detail in the maps (improved aesthetic quality and improved gameflow throughout), meticulously scripted NPC's, super-cool models, detailed animations, volumetric fog, and chilling cinematics.  This entire team worked 'round the clock (literally; you should see Andrew Welch's e-mail messages when he's writing at 4:30 in the morning) to make E3 a success, and to push us light years closer to a solid, successful completion of the project.\n\n- - - - -\n\nQUICK, RANDOM NOTES FOR MONDAY, 05/10/99:\n\nEveryone's been working long hours in preparation for E3.  Lots of surprises in store.  And that's all I have to say about that.  ;-)\n\nMost of the mapping team has moved on to tweaking Episodes 3 and 4.  Iikka's re-building e3m7 from scratch, and is creating some of the most stunning architecture I've ever seen in a shooter.  Gothic is Iikka's favorite style, and it shows.  He's burning through this one hard, and doing a great job.\n\nThey're ALL doing a great job.  KC, Larry, Bobby, and you know what... YOU'RE doing a great job!\n\nOh!  Oh!  Cripes, how could I have forgotten to mention this (just goes to show, I need to get back in the swing of updating this thing):  John's been spending the lion's share of his time mapping.  Yeah!  ROCK HARD!  It's been hard for John to find the time because of that wacky \"project leadership\" thing he does so well... but I SWEAR, he's been making time to do some hardcore level design.  This is significant because, now more than ever, the game is taking on that \"Romero feel.\"  The game had a lot of that back in January, when I first stepped on board, but it's undeniable at this point.  As I see more of John's direct influence on the game, I'm getting that cool, creepy feeling I had when I first played shareware Doom.  Or maybe I need a space heater.  You decide.\n\nLook both ways.  New subject coming up fast....\n\nFor those who haven't tried it, you owe it to yourselves to check out Ridge Racer Type 4 for the PSX.  The game looks phenomenal, is super-fast and challenging, and it manages to retain much of the freewheeling arcade feel of the original.  \n\nWhat I find especially provocative about this installment of Ridge Racer is how various cultures are represented in the game by racing team managers.  The [female] manager of the French team is engaged to be married, but will leave her fianc\u00d9\u0089 and marry you if you win the Grand Prix.  The Japanese team manager will RIDE YOUR ASS and dismiss you as a punk until you make it to the 3rd heat, at which point he'll offer you his undying loyalty.  The manager of the Italian team... umm... I forget what he does.  But it's the American team manager who cracks me up:  The guy's an ineffectual pencil-pusher whose team has suffered endless strings of defeats.  He lacks assertiveness when dealing with HIS boss (which means you usually wind up with underpowered cars because your team remains woefully underfunded), worries about how he appears to his subordinates, and will lavish you with praise if you finish a race in 2nd or 3rd place.  (\"Second place!  Wow!  Great job!  I KNEW you could do it!\"  Or something like that.)\n\nSomewhere in there is a lesson about how other cultures view us.  Or at least how the guys at Namco view us.  Or not.  Or maybe I need a space heater.  You decide.\n\n- - - - -\n\nQUICK NOTES FOR TUESDAY, 02/23/99:\n\nSuper-quick update, as time is short, and the caffeine hasn't had its full effect yet.  The Mplayer demo is flat-out gorgeous.  Bobby, Iikka and Larry have done an incredible job on the maps, feeding off of one another's ideas to exponentially improve the environments with every build.  Great job, guys!\n\nKillCreek is taking some extra time to tweak e1m4, while I'm doing general touch-up on the first episode.  The rest of the team has moved on to Episode 2, and they're making quick progress.\n\n- - - - -\n\nQUICK NOTES FOR WEDNESDAY, 02/10/99:\n\nTonight's plan is actually from 02/04.  It just took me a while to put it up because we're... um... trying to make a game or something [?].  So, without further ado, we hope you enjoy this very special edition of \"The Best of Klie.\"\n\n- - - - - \n\nHey, there!  How ya doin', how ya doin', how ya doin'!  A warm-hearted Texas hello from... TEXAS!  The state that brought you [TEXAS JOKE OMITTED DUE TO RAMPANT STATE PRIDE, WHICH, I MIGHT ADD, IS MUCH DESERVED; THANK YOU].\n\nANYWAY, it's 4:57 a.m., and my sleep schedule is getting weirder and weirder.  I find myself repeating certain words over and over.  And over.  But the pain... the sweat... the gut-breaking agony... it will all be worth it the day we ship This Century's Game, DAIKATANA!  Yessir!\n\n\t...that... ...right there... ...was a beautiful moment... ...no, no, wait... ...that's not a tear... ...just... ...something in my eye...\n\nQUICK NOTES FOR THURSDAY, 02/04/99:\n\nEpisode 1 core-architecture clean-up and lighting passes nearly complete.  Soon, most of this AWESOME MAP DESIGN TEAM will move on to episode 2.  I'll stay behind and continue detailing episode 1.  The team will forget about me, and will go on to lead productive lives without me.  I'll cry myself to sleep each night.  Alone.\n\n...sigh... ...I can't continue with this... ...it's just too... ...okay, well, maybe I can:\n\nRich Carlson has been doing some architectural work, and major lighting work, on e1m1.  I'm amazed by the aesthetic sensibilities Rich brings to this map, which can only be described as stunning.\n\nStevie Case wins this month's land-speed record, RE-creating e1m4 FROM SCRATCH!!!  It's NUTS, I tell you!  (Yes, this is a brand, spanking new e1m4; not to be confused with the old e1m4, which was discontinued due to... well, the official reason given was \"a desire to make something better.\"  You know what they say: You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs.)\n\nBobby Pavlock and Larry Herring, in addition to refining e1m3 and e1m5, have been spanning the globe to bring you the finest in deathmatch entertainment.  They keep going on about some... oh, what's the phrase those kids use... some \"tournament.\"  Bobby's like, \"These deathmatch maps are going to KICK ASS,\" and Larry's like, \"These deathmatch maps are going to KICK ASS,\" and \"You get to play against John Romero [who, apparently, is some corporate bigshot around here; whoop-dee-doo].\"  They WILL NOT SHUT UP!\n\nAnd last, but not least, this year's most eligible mapper (the ladies say he looks good in basic black), Iikka Keranen, has working his insane magic on e1m6 and e1m7.  I've never seen a mapper work so quickly and confidently.  And the stuff he produces is both captivating and frightening.  You'll see.  ;-)\n\nUmmmmmmmmmmm..... hmm.  How to wrap this up....  (oh, my, is it really 5:30 in the morning).\n\nUmm....\n\n...hey, look at the time!  Gotta go!

Two weeks ago I said to my co workers \"Buffy is back with the comedy...but can they bring the tragedy?\" This episode was very, very emotional and really got to me.

In its place, The WB will air an encore\nepisode of the series titled \u00c2\u0093Band Candy.\u00c2\u0094\n\nThe following statement was made by Jamie Kellner.\n\n\u00c2\u0093It is out of sympathy and compassion for the families and communities\nthat have been devastated by the recent senseless acts of violence\nperpetrated on high school campuses that we have decided to delay this\nbroadcast.  Our decision is also borne out of a deep sense of\nresponsibility to The WB\u00c2\u0092s loyal young audience.\n\n\u00c2\u0093At issue for us was a short part of the climactic scene of this\npowerful two-part season finale.  During a solar eclipse that occurs\nduring his commencement speech at Sunnydale High\u00c2\u0092s graduation ceremony,\nthe mayor morphs into a 60-foot serpent and attacks the students.  In\nturn, Buffy and her classmates are forced to defend themselves.  Given\nthe current climate, depicting acts of violence at a high school\ngraduation ceremony, even fantasy acts against 60-foot serpents and\nvampires, we believe, is inappropriate to broadcast around the actual\ndates of these time-honored ceremonies.\n\n\u00c2\u0093We apologize to the millions of loyal \u00c2\u0091Buffy\u00c2\u0092 viewers who are eagerly\nanticipating this episode.  We sincerely hope that you understand that\nthe last thing we want to do is pre-empt our season finale.  However, at\nthis time, we feel that it is the best and most responsible decision for\nus to make.\n\n\u00c2\u0093Like most of its loyal fans and the nations critics, we at The WB\nconsider BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER to be one of the highest quality\nprograms on television today.  We plan on being able to broadcast\n\u00c2\u0093Graduation Day, Parts One and Two\u00c2\u0094 later in the summer.  Next season,\nBuffy and her cohorts, having graduated from high school, will be\ninvolved in their greatest adventures ever.\u00c2\u0094\n---\n\nWhat a steaming crock of dogshit. There are only a few good shows on TV,\nand Buffy is the cream of the crop. Television suits are a bunch of\nspineless sissies.\n\n\n\n--------------\nI've seen a lot of Jar Jar hatred on the net lately.\n\nIf you ask me...\n\nJar Jar Binks was the most HUMAN of all the characters, actors, and aliens\nin Episode 1. The rest of the actors were stiff and robotic.\n\nWhich is extremely ironic, seeing as the CG character out-performed the\n\"real\" actors.\n\nGuys, the movie isn't going to be ALIENS. It is a kiddie popcorn Saturday\nMatinee Bubblegum fable. Jar Jar was charming and full of life and the \nmost memorable being in the film.\n\nDarth Maul may have been interesting, had he more than a cameo in \nthe picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------\nOn Monday I purchased several action figures from the new \n\"Star Wars\" line, including Obi Wan Kenobi.\n\nI also purchased \"Dessicator\" from McFarlane toys.\n\nBoth were purchased at a gaming store in the local mall.\n\nwww.cliffyb.com/actionfigures.jpg\n\nHere we see the two action figures side by side.\n\nDessicator-> $12.99\nObi Wan-> $9.99\n\nNow, is it just me or is there a major difference between\nthe quality of these two figures?\n\nThe new star wars action figures suck. The old ones sucked,\nand the new ones continue that fabulous tradition of suckage.\n\nThey're not even as cool as GI Joes that were released 10+\nyears ago. \n\nHey, Lucas, ever hear of KUNG FU GRIP?\n\n[Now, I know there are \"deluxe\" Star Wars figures available, \nbut my point here is that I'm getting 10x more value for a \nmere 3 dollars from McFarlane Toys.]\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\nYesterday we released a screenshot of a bunch of our UT characters.\n\nhttp://www.bluesnews.com/screenshots/ut/utshot1.shtml\n\nMany people, in emails and messageboards, are claiming that the guys in\nthis picture are not meshes, and are just skins.\n\nTHIS IS NOT TRUE. The characters in this picture are ACTUAL IN GAME\nMODELS, texture mapped, and ready to go. Notice the lack of stretching\nor mirroring. Yes, they do look that good.\n\nSuck on it.\n\n\n-----------\nhttp://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/04/25/1438249\n\nExcellent article on the recent incident in Colorado.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------\nRandom Musings\n\nIn Britney Spears' \"One More Time\" video, why does the school bell ring\n*after* three o'clock?\n\nWhy hasn't anyone made a class based mod like Team Fortress where the \nclasses are the Village People?\n\nWhen the hell IS Lunar Complete coming out on PSX?\n\nAt a flea market the other day I was able to find the original Ninja\nGaiden and Excitebike. I was stoked. I can't locate Chrono Trigger\nanywhere, though, anyone have a copy they want to loan me?\n\n\n-------------------\nI beat Silent Hill today.\n\nWhat, exactly the fuck, was that story about? Can someone point me to a\nsummary that explains it, because it really made little sense to me. I\ngot the good+ ending, FYI.\n\nWebsites should be back up shortly, thanks to Mek.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------\n\nKudos to Xatrix Entertainment for having the most enormous cajhones in the\ngaming business.\n\nWhat a brilliant product.\n\nIn other news, this was one hell of a GDC. My head still hurts.\n\n\n\n-------\nWell, I'm off to GDC in the morning with Pancho. Looking forward to seeing everyone there and having a good time. Oh, and I'm hoping to learn a thing or two also. =)\n\nWe'll be showing UT at various hardware vendors' booths, I'll be there often to open up a can of whup-ass on all who dare step. Hee hee!\n\nMake sure you stop by the roundtable I'm hosting as well as the panel I'm participating in!\n\n-Where the Hell is 3D Shooter Gameplay Going?\n3/17, 10:00 - 11:00 am (San Carlos I, Hilton)\n\n-Where the Hell is 3D Shooter Gameplay Going?\n3/18, 3:30 - 4:30 (Plaza Room, Hilton)\n\n-The Future of 3D Level Design: Technique and Philosophy\n3/19, 11:30 - 12:30 (J2, Convention Center)\nPanel hosted by Romero with some very notable level designers\n\np.s.

These people would not have purchased our games to begin with. Their\ninterests lie in hunting or dolls, not aliens and swordplay.\n\n2. These games are \"gateway games\" to other genres, to \"real\" games. They\nreduce the \"intimidation factor\" that computers carry with them. Perhaps\nonce the rednecks get tired of the hunting games they'll be interested in\nsome real software. When the girls who are playing Barbie get older perhaps\nthey'll graduate to big guns and Deathmatch.\n\n3. They're creating even more genres for the industry that help it to\nappeal to a wider consumer base. Notice how the music biz has product that\nappeals to everyone, music from Shania Twain to Ice T to Barenaked Ladies.\nUntil recently we haven't seen a lot of games that have appealed to people\noutside of our little geek circle, and the market is being cracked wide open.\n\n4. Companies are making more money off of these games, if a publisher like\nGT makes a lot of money off of Deer Hunter II then they'll still be around\nto publish your game if you do the solo thing.\n\n5. More market penetration. Games are in sporting goods stores and the\nBarbie section of Toys R Us, keeping the concept of PC entertainment in the\nheads of people everywhere. Getting into stores besides EB and Babbages is\na good thing. I know people who wouldn't be caught dead in a gaming\nspecialty store.\n\nDo not fear this renaissance. Embrace it, my geeky brethren.\n\n-------------\n\nNon game related anecdote:\n\nOkay, so last night on the way to see 8MM (pretty good movie) my Fiancee'\nand I stopped by the local supermarket to get some beer. We go up to the\nregister and I put down the beer and the lady asks for my ID so I show it.\nShe then says \"I can't sell this to you unless I see both of your ID's.\"\n\nMy Fiancee' isn't 21 yet, even if she was she didn't bring her ID with her,\nso I said \"Okay, honey, go wait in the car while I buy this.\" and the clerk\nsays \"No, I saw you two come in here, and I can't sell it to you.\"\n\nSo, when did this happy horse shit start? What happens if a father goes to\nthe market with his 5 year old son? What if it is a hot day and he needs to\ndo some shopping, is he going to leave his kid in a sweltering car where he\ncan be abducted or fry? I don't think so.\n\nI can remember dozens of times before I was 21 that I went to the market\nwith my mother and she purchased wine or liquor. No trouble there.\n\nIt's not like this is going to stop underage drinking. We simply went to\nanother supermarket and she waited in the car. Big deal.\n\nAnd why can't you buy beer after 2am? This impedes the nightlife in Raleigh\nas well... you go out at 11pm to party and you're supposed to be done by\n2am? You're not even buzzed by then!\n\n------------------\nMUST\nSTOP\nPLAYING\nTOURNAMENT\n------------------\n\nBrandon \"Greenmarine\" Reinhart posted this to our messageboard\n(megaboard.epicgames.com) and I think it says a lot about UT:\n\n\t\"I think its really important to reiterate that UT isn't just multiplayer.\nI've be"}, {"by": "cliffy@epicgames.com", "time": 937411620, "contents": "User:   cliff\nRead:   2\nUnread: 1\nTime:   Wed, 15 Sep 1999 11:06:34 -0700\nPlan:\n++++++DISCLAIMER++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAw, fuck this I'm not a lawyer.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n---------------------------------------------------\nHome Page: www.cliffyb.com (seldom updated)\nemail: cliff@epicgames.com (rarely answered)\nCat-Scan Contest: www.cat-scan.com (always illegal)\nTales From The Hellmouth: www.hellmouth.org\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nWE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!!\n\nhee hee\n\nIn other news, check this out:\n\nhttp://members.tripod.com/a-c-s/\n\nLet's spam this poll in favour of the contest!\n\nAlso, in UT demo news... the cool people over at \nGamekey have set up an alert system for the demo.\n\nhttp://www.filekey.com/key.php?filekey=utpredemo1\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nOn Monday I'm speaking at the GDC Raleigh.\n\nIf you're in the area and have 90 bucks to spare, the GDC roadshows are\nworth checking out.\n\nhttp://www.gdconf.com/1999/roadtrips/raleigh.htm\n\nAlso...\n\nhttp://www.cliffyb.com/trophy.jpg\n\nHow damned cool is that?\n\n--------------\nhttp://www.cliffyb.com/decals.jpg\n\nCan you say \"MCNASTY?\"\n\nI think you can.\n\n-----------------------------\nDan Sarkar, artist supreme, created this little \"motivational\" image \nfor all you developers out there.\n\nhttp://www.cliffyb.com/violence.jpg\n\nEnjoy.\n\n=)\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nI'd like to welcome James Green to the Epic team!\n\nJames is a great modeler/animator/artist who has cool hair and a cool\nattitude.\n\nPlus, he hates the sunlight just like the rest of us.

Be a l33t UT p1mp! Help us\nout! I'll let you touch my shiny shirt at e3 next year! =)\n\nFor those of you who are curious- you can adjust the gamespeed to crank\nup the action in UT. You can also adjust the amount of Air Control...\n\nThese features are great to add variety to your game!\n\n\n\n--------\nOkay, here are a few gameplay related notes on the demo that should help \nyou whup ass like I do around here. :)\n\nWeapons\n-------\n-Translocator\n\tThis is on by default in CTF and Domination. If you want, you \ncan turn it on for deathmatch when you start a server or a practice \nsession. You can use it to get to hard to reach spots, telefragging \nopponents, or you can just leave it in a spot you want to return to \nlater. Once you translocate, you can switch back to your previously \nselected weapon by doing the following: When you hit ALT FIRE to \ntranslocate, keep it held down. While it is held, you'll translocate, \nthen hit regular fire again. You'll switch back to your last weapon \nright away.\n\n-Impact Hammer\n\tThe Melee weapon. The regular fire charges up as you hold it. \nSimply keep the button held and walk up to and touch someone (while \nstill holding the button, it takes 2-3 seconds to get to a full \ncharge.) This will cause serious damage. If they're wounded or are \nlacking armour, chances are you'll kill 'em. You can use the regular \nfire to \"impact jump\" to higher areas at the risk of some damage. \nSimply charge the tool, look down, jump and release.\n\tThe alt fire can deflect non-trace (hitscan) projectiles if \nyou time it right. It also damages foes but is more useful for \ndefense rather than offense.\n\n-Enforcer(s)\n\tIt is a handgun. (duh) Regular fire is slower but more accurate, \nalt fire is less accurate but faster. You can get 2 of them for John \nWoo action. They suddenly become VERY useful at that point.\n\n-Shock Rifle\n\tSimilar to the ASMD- the gun is INSTANT HIT, even though the \neffect sears the air after the shot fires through. Regular fire does a \ngood amount of damage and imparts a LOT of momentum on foes. If you are \nplaying DM-MORPHEUS, it is very useful for knocking people off the \nskyscrapers. Alt-fire shoots slower moving plasma balls. You can combo \nthis like in Unreal1 by shooting the alt fire blob with the regular fire.\n\n\n-Minigun\n\tRegular fire- more accurate, slower, alt fire- less accurate, \nfaster. Eats up a lot of ammo. Pretty useful when you have the Damage \nAmp. (\"Udamage.\")\n\n\n-Pulse Gun\n\tRegular fire- fast firing plasma balls. Very strong, but you \nhave to lead your targets. Alt fire- Lighting shaft of plasma. Has a \nlimited range but is very useful, especially with the Udamage. It is \nlike a knife through butter when you have the Udamage and use the \naltfire.\n\n-Rocket Launcher\n\tRegular fire- fires rockets, hold button for up to 6, at which \npoint it auto-releases. Alt fire lobs grenades, you can hold the \nbutton on this mode as well. IMPORTANT- If you are one of those who do \nnot like this feature, you can turn it off now under \nOPTIONS-PREFERENCES-INPUT. However, bear in mind that those who learn \nand get used to the way the gun works will probably smear you. If you \nkeep your crosshair on a foe then it will turn red and a beep will \nsound. Your rocket(s) are now homing, so let em fly. Finally, if you \nstart loading up regular rockets and you hit the alt fire button while \nyou're doing this your rockets will be released in a tight pattern \ninstead of fanning out.\n\nGameplay\n--------\n\n-Dodging defaults to on. You can easily turn it off. I'd suggest \ngetting used to it. It took me a couple of months during Unreal1's \ndevelopment, and now that I'm used to it I don't fall into lava or \ndodge accidentally. I use it well and I'm able to escape attacks quickly.\nBear in mind that dodging in low gravity will give you great momentum,\nit is an easy way to zip around. Also, Dodging forward will make you \nflip forward.\n\n-Feigndeath is bind-able in the regular menus. When you are faking, \nyour name will not show up on other people's HUD's when they have their \ncrosshairs on you. Oh, and remember, feigning death with the shieldbelt \non is just dumb.\n\n-Throw weapon is very useful in team games. You can bind this in the \nmenus as well. When you hit this key you'll throw your current weapon \nout... use it to hook up your buddies with guns. It also has other \ninteresting functions- one time in a firefight Alan was coming after me \nand I threw my gun into his hand (the Flak Cannon, it has a longer \nweapon switch time than many of the other guns) and I was able to blast \nhim while he was confused and switching. It was like an action movie \nwhere one guy throws his gun to the other guy, says \"catch\" and shoots \nhim. :)\n\n-Weapon Prioritization is in the main menus and is very easy to \nnavigate. Just drag your fav gun to the top, and the gun you like the \nleast to the bottom. You can prioritize the translocator and impact \nhammer as well. I'd suggest making use of the SWITCH BEST WEAPON binding \noption, as this will switch to your highest priority weapon in your \npriority list when you press it. Very useful. [This is also another \nway to put the translocator away once you teleport.]\n\nMAPS\n----\n\n-Map cycle lists\nThe default deathmatch map cycle list cycles Phobos and Turbine. \nMorpheus is a wide open low grav map that may not run as well as \nthe other 2 maps online, and if you want to cycle it you'll need to\nmodify the map list when you're starting your server/practice session.\n\nPhobos\n\n-Jump boots are extremely useful in this space station map. \n-The central courtyard is one big clusterfuck, and if you go for the \nhidden shieldbelt down there you'll need those boots to high tail it \nto a higher level. \n-There are another pair of jump boots out near the armour/health \nvials/minigun, and you can use those to jump up on the outside of the \nspace station and surprise foes. \n-Also, remember that you can \"lift jump\" in UT. It works like this- \nwhen riding a lift, and it is almost at the top, hit JUMP and you'll \ncatch a lot of extra air. \n-If someone is controlling the tower in Phobos where the Damage Amp \nis, you can lift jump over them and spray down hot lead as you're \nfalling towards them, they'll never know what hit them.\n-Phobos CAN be played one on one, but you may spend a fair amount \nof time hunting.\n\nTurbine\n\n-The Amp can only be accessed by impact jumping. Yes, the bots will \ngo for it. :) \n-There is a great camper spot up high somewhere near the highest \nminigun/health/armour.\n-The shieldbelt is hidden behind a shootable wall in this map.\n-Make sure you use audio cues in this map. They'll give away your \nfoes' locations all over the place. :)\n-Turbine can be played one on one without feeling too large.\n\nMorpheus\n-The Shock Rifle's regular fire is damned useful on this map. You \ncan knock people off the buildings easily.\n-Beware of combo-move monkeys on this map that hang out in the \nmiddle level.\n-Impact jumping will give you a hell of a vertical edge on your \nfoes. Try impact jumping and unloading rockets like mad on your \nfoes as you're coming down.\n-Pulse gun is very useful on this map. The alt fire will work \nwonders on a floating target.\n-Morpheus can be played one on one without feeling too large.\n\nThat's about it for now.

Jeez.\n\n-----------------------\n\nWARNING!\n\nGEEK NOSTALGIA ALERT!\n\nLike most others my age, I was not only raised on Atari, Sega and Nintendo\u00c2\u0085 I was raised on Giant Robots!\n\nMy brother visited my mom\u00c2\u0092s house recently and dug out our Transformer collection and FedEx\u00c2\u0092d me a pile of them. He used to collect the Decepticons, I\u00c2\u0092d collect the Autobots. They provided us with countless hours of enjoyment. I remember we were initially into the Go-Bots; we had acquired a couple of them and were enjoying them until we saw the commercials for the Transformers at which point we realized how sucky the Go-Bots were and abandoned them.\n\nWe went over to the five and dime in Andover, Mass. and I got \u00c2\u0093Bluestreak\u00c2\u0094 while he got \u00c2\u0093Thundercracker.\u00c2\u0094 At that point a line in the sand was drawn, my brother would forever be a Decepticon and I would always be an Autobot. It\u00c2\u0092s amazing how far you can stretch paper route cash on toys when you\u00c2\u0092re determined enough. We\u00c2\u0092d ask for TF\u00c2\u0092s for our birthdays, Christmas, and any other occasion we could think of.  I remember my mother was uncomfortable with buying Megatron for my brother because he was a gun\u00c2\u0085 a Walther p38, nonetheless. I think about that toy now and if you walked around in public with it you\u00c2\u0092d get your ass shot or arrested!\n\nWe swung by Child World one day when we were driving into Boston and I picked up Optimus Prime. I always loved Prime, he was the coolest toy and his character kicked total ass on the cartoon series.\n\nThat\u00c2\u0092s why the film was so upsetting! When Optimus Prime died I was totally bummed out\u00c2\u0085 they then had to go replace him with that lamer Rodimus Prime and the TV series went to shit. Galvatron just owned everyone in the film and they then had to make him land in that pile of space goo, turning him into a blathering idiot. My brother and I still argue about who won that battle, Megatron or Prime. If Hot Rod hadn\u00c2\u0092t got in the way\u00c2\u0085 dammit! Gotta admit, though, the relationship between Daniel and Hot Rod was great; what kid hadn\u00c2\u0092t dreamt of having a giant ass kicking robot for a friend? I think that\u00c2\u0092s part of why I loved \u00c2\u0093Iron Giant\u00c2\u0094 so much, BTW.\n\nI swear, the TF film still holds up today, the animation was spectacular. I remember my jaw dropping when I was in the theater and I heard Spike say \u00c2\u0093Oh SHIT!\u00c2\u0094 That was the pinnacle of Geek Zen, hearing that kind of language in the movie you\u00c2\u0092d been waiting for.\n\nAh, well, I digress\u00c2\u0085\n\nPrecursor to my Transformer obsession was \u00c2\u0093Force Five.\u00c2\u0094\n\nhttp://www.concentric.net/~marsala9/force5.html\n\nYou can find some great stuff on this site about the series. I recently found a 7\u00c2\u0094 tall, Die Cast Metal \u00c2\u0093Grandizer\u00c2\u0094 on Ebay and I\u00c2\u0092m trying to collect all 3 of the Starvengers. I picked up several of the videos of the series on Amazon, just do a search and you\u00c2\u0092ll find them. GRANDIZER GO! hehe\n\nWe used to love watching that after school, as well as \u00c2\u0093Starblazers.\u00c2\u0094 Starblazers was a another series that 0wned.\n\nOkay, I\u00c2\u0092m going to go back to my geek cave now. =)\n\n------------------------------\nDISCLAIMER: I am simply setting the record straight on what this mod does and why Epic does not support it or encourage its use.\n\n-On ZeroPing-\n\nLag has been a factor in network first person shooters like UT and Q3A, since the original release of QuakeWorld.  When I first saw ZeroPing for UT, I thought that a mere modmaker had finally managed to do what the Sweeneys and Carmacks of this world could not do - get rid of lag once and for all.\n\nB"}, {"by": "cliffy@epicgames.com", "time": 973585920, "contents": "User:   cliff\nRead:   2\nUnread: 1\nTime:   Tue, 7 Nov 2000 02:32:03 -0800\nPlan:\n---------------------------------------------------\nHome Page: www.cliffyb.com (seldom updated)\nemail: cliff@epicgames.com (rarely answered)\nCat-Scan Contest: www.cat-scan.com (always illegal)\nTales From The Hellmouth: www.hellmouth.org\nCliffyB's Ownage: www.planetunreal.com/cliffyb\nCLIFFYB CAM! www.cliffyb.com/cam\n---------------------------------------------\nhttp://www.planetunreal.com/eavy/assault.html\n\nAssault Bonus Pack.\n\nGo.\n\nDownload.\n\nNow.\n\n--------------------------------------\nDaily Cat Scan is live.\n\nwww.cat-scan.com\n\nPh34r m3. =)\n\nMad props to Kazi Wren who is doing most of the work. :)\n\n--------------------------\n\nJust when you thought you were safe.\n\nCat Scan returns.\n\nMonday, October 16th, 2000.\n\nBe there.\n\nwww.cat-scan.com\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2000/US/09/25/football.melee.ap/index.html\n\nOnce again we see an incident of violence erupt at a youth sporting event.\n\nWe must regulate youth sports.

Gotta admit, though, the relationship between Daniel and Hot Rod was great; what kid hadn\u00c2\u0092t dreamt of having a giant ass kicking robot for a friend? I think that\u00c2\u0092s part of why I loved \u00c2\u0093Iron Giant\u00c2\u0094 so much, BTW.\n\nI swear, the TF film still holds up today, the animation was spectacular. I remember my jaw dropping when I was in the theater and I heard Spike say \u00c2\u0093Oh SHIT!\u00c2\u0094 That was the pinnacle of Geek Zen, hearing that kind of language in the movie you\u00c2\u0092d been waiting for.\n\nAh, well, I digress\u00c2\u0085\n\nPrecursor to my Transformer obsession was \u00c2\u0093Force Five.\u00c2\u0094\n\nhttp://www.concentric.net/~marsala9/force5.html\n\nYou can find some great stuff on this site about the series.

I picked up several of the videos of the series on Amazon, just do a search and you\u00c2\u0092ll find them. GRANDIZER GO! hehe\n\nWe used to love watching that after school, as well as \u00c2\u0093Starblazers.\u00c2\u0094 Starblazers was a another series that 0wned.\n\nOkay, I\u00c2\u0092m going to go back to my geek cave now. =)\n\n------------------------------\nDISCLAIMER: I am simply setting the record straight on what this mod does and why Epic does not support it or encourage its use.\n\n-On ZeroPing-\n\nLag has been a factor "}, {"by": "cnorden@ionstorm.com", "time": 926429940, "contents": "\n*** Ion Storm's Finger Server\n\nUser name: cnorden\nPlan modified: Tue May 11 10:38:17 1999\n\nWell, the E3 demo CDs are burned, tested, labeled, and ready to go!

I hope its as fun as it sounds.  It sure does look great.\n\n\n5/6/98\nHope everyone at cgdc gets a chance to check out Riot and see how great it looks.  Cause it sure deserves to get some attention for how awesome it plays and looks.\n\nBlood2 is gonna be in great shape by the time that e3 comes around and should turn a few heads.  The levels that Bill are sending down will blow people away.  There will be no wacked out architecture built by alien races to be seen which is a breathe of fresh air.

The faces of my people are now etched in my memory in the terrible contortions of torment and oppression.  For this offense, I will never find forgiveness in my heart.  I can only hope that I will see the Sidhe faces, as they once were - perfect and beautiful. It has only been a day, or so I have calculated since this infernal world has no day or night cycle (just an eternal twilight of sorts), since I arrived here from the realm that spawned D'sparil.  \n\n\tD'sparil is dead, as are his minions, so Parthoris and my people are free from the curse of his oppression, but I discovered something there that greatly disturbs me.  D'sparil was not alone.  The ether realm that he calls home spawned several Serpent Riders.  While I wasn't able to determine the exact number, more certainly exist.  I can't in good conscience wish them on someone else, but I pray to what ever gods are left that they don't follow in D'sparil's footsteps and invade Parthoris.  I hope that whatever land they do make war on is fortunate enough to have someone that can stand up to them, before all of their lands are enslaved.  If only I had been a true hero and saved Parthoris before it fell into the clutches of his evil sorcery, then perhaps so many would not have died.\n\n\tMy sleep has been restless with dreams of my battle with \nD'sparil.  I can see D'sparil erupting into a pyre of flame as the Phoenix slams into his body.  Every detail of the dream is so real that I can almost taste the soot rolling off his burning corpse. As I stand watching him writhing in the combined agony of my people, basking in the flames of my victory, I can hear the screams of his death.  Buried within these agonizing cries lies all of the hate and anger that drove him to destroy and conquer my people.  It is this voice that I can hear cursing my very existence.  No matter how many nights this dream haunts my sleep, I can never really understand the exact words that he utters, but the essence of the curse washes over me like the frigid water of a frozen lake.  It makes my bones and heart ache in the complete despair of its depravity. \n\n\tThe dream ends then, but the bitter sense of hopelessness remains with me even now as I write these words.  I don't understand what the curse was, but I fear it more than I feared D'sparil himself.  It is a baser, more instinctual childhood fear.\n\n\tWhen I was a child, growing up in Silverspring, I had a habit of wandering under the docks of the city looking for shells and starfish that had washed up out of the ocean.  There was an old Ssithra man that was willing to pay for the really good shells.  He used them to make very intricate tapestries, which he took home and sold to his people.  He required the shells to be in perfect condition, so I began venturing out into the water to find the best shells before they were smashed into the rocks under the piers.  I even constructed a crude cage out of wood and twine bits that I had found lying around amidst the rest of the refuse Silverspring seemed to hide under the docks. I used it to collect the shells while I waded through the water.\n\tThis particular day I had wandered out farther than I usually do.  The water was deeper than I was tall, so I was swimming to the bottom of the bay and scooping up handfuls of dirt and sifting through them for worthy shells.    The water in the bay isn't very salty, like in the deeper ocean so I tended to swim with my eyes open.  Sometimes I would stop and just look at the ocean and the light filtering down through the water.  I always thought to myself that there couldn't be anything more beautiful.  It was like falling into a trance because nothing else mattered to me when I was like that.  \n\tIt was when I was in one of these states of awe that I was aroused, suddenly, into a state of sudden and uncontrollable panic.  I don't know what caused it, but there I was just floating about 5 feet underwater and everything was suddenly enveloped in a deep shadow.  The sun was gone and I couldn't see more than a foot or two in front of me.  I spun around, and for one very panicked moment I was lost.  Any sense of up or down were lost to me; I was convinced that I was going to drown.  The panic and fear I felt was so deep that it robbed me of any hope of escaping the clutches of the shadow that had enveloped me.  The shadow passed as quickly as it had come and I dove for the surface, my lungs ready to burst from my panic.  Later, when I was sitting on a pier well away from the edge of the water and watching the sun's fire being doused by the ocean waters, I felt very small.  I think it was the point in my childhood that I realized how big the world really was.  I think it was the exact moment that I realized that I, one day may die.

That\u00c2\u0092s the consequence of writing in the first flush of righteous indignation. I apologize to Geoff for that. He\u00c2\u0092s been very patient and courteous in his emails. I stand by my opinion, but there was no need for me to be such a prick about it. I loathe that kind of childishness in others, so there\u00c2\u0092s no reason I should tolerate it in my own behavior.\n\nAnyway, my other motive for this update is to explain what I mean by narrative structure. This isn\u00c2\u0092t intended as a defense of my argument, merely as a definition of terms, since several people have expressed confusion about the distinctions I\u00c2\u0092m drawing.\n\nThough it\u00c2\u0092s tempting to write an essay on story structure, I\u00c2\u0092ll try to stay focused. :)\n\nMost story-driven games rely on a linear structure out of necessity, primarily because a story is linear by definition. I wasn\u00c2\u0092t suggesting that the events in Dark Forces change the flow of the game, but they DO affect the flow of the narrative. Pretty much every level in Dark Forces, Outlaws, and Jedi Knight contains some sort of discovery or reversal that advances the storyline. Kyle\u00c2\u0092s first encounter with a dark trooper is a major event in Dark Forces. The boss fights in Outlaws bring Marshall James Anderson closer to the man who killed his wife. In one Jedi Knight mission, Kyle has to find his father\u00c2\u0092s data disk in order to locate the Valley of the Jedi, which eventually leads him to the final confrontation with Jerec. There are plenty of other examples.\n\nIn each of these cases, the protagonist has a short term objective that is a facet of the larger goal that fuels the central conflict. When the hero meets or fails to meet one of these objectives, the story advances. Whether or not failure is even an option in the context of the game is irrelevant. I\u00c2\u0092m not talking about gameplay, but about story.\n\nAt its most basic, a story is a conflict between a protagonist and antagonist with competing goals. Think of these roles as forces rather than individuals. Most stories rely on a human or personified non-human to fill the protagonist\u00c2\u0092s shoes, simply because that\u00c2\u0092s what we relate to as human beings. The antagonist, on the other hand, can take any number of forms. It can be anything from abiding grief over the death of a loved one to an elusive white whale to bloodsucking aliens from the planet Bob. In a really good story, the antagonistic force is multi-faceted, with emotional, situational, and physical components.\n\nObviously, if the antagonistic force isn\u00c2\u0092t menacing enough, the story stagnates because you stop taking the conflict seriously. In fact, the antagonist usually has to seem far more powerful than the protagonist in order to keep your interest. Think of the Empire in Star Wars, for example. Same goes for Sauron\u00c2\u0092s forces in Lord of the Rings, the shark in Jaws, the asteroid in Armageddon, the bandits in The Seven Samurai, Sephiroth in Final Fantasy VII, or Liquid Snake and his cohorts in Metal Gear Solid.\n\nIf the motives of the protagonist and antagonist are never fully developed, the narrative withers, which can be fatal in a movie or a novel, but generally makes no difference at all in a game. Ultimately, all that matters is that the PLAYER has a motive to keep playing.\n\nPersonally, I tend to gravitate toward games with a strong narrative structure, but I don\u00c2\u0092t discriminate as long as I\u00c2\u0092m having fun. Shigeru Miyamoto\u00c2\u0092s games are about deep gameplay rather than elaborate storytelling, but they\u00c2\u0092re still among the richest, most satisfying gaming experiences you can have.\n\nAnyway, this long-winded explanation just scratches the surface of story structure, but hopefully it clarifies my meaning. I expect I\u00c2\u0092ll hear about it if not. :)\n\n\n\n"}, {"by": "crhinehart@humanhead.com", "time": 967723980, "contents": "Welcome to Human Head Studios' Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Chris Rhinehart\nEmail: crhinehart@humanhead.com\nDescription: Programmer\nProject: Rune\nWeb Page: Human Head Studios' Web SiteThis plan file is the opinion of the individual who writes it and does not reflect the opinions of the Human Head Studios.\nLast Updated: 08/31/2000 08:17:59 (GMT Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAugust 31, 2000\n---------------\n\nCurrent top five mp3s to play to annoy your coworkers \nduring crunch mode (in no particular order):\n\n5) Britney Spears \"Oops I Did It Again\"\n4) The TV Theme from \"The Greatest American Hero\"\n3) Anything written by Wesley Willis\n2) Kermit the Frog singing \"Rainbow Connection\"\n1) The Chicago Bears singing \"The Superbowl Shuffle\"\n"}, {"by": "dave.meddish@dynamix.com", "time": 926467320, "contents": "Message of the Day:\n\nWelcome to the Dynamix Finger Server!\nbe sure to check out http://www.dynamix.com\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nUser Name: dave.meddish     Plan Last Modified: 05/11/1999 18:57:13 PST\n\n\n\ndave.meddish.plan\n\n\n\n5.4.99\nHmmm, been a while since I've updated the ol' .plan file.  But that I had something\nto say...\n\n\nSenor Spiffcat and I have been working on the TRIBES Writer's Guide and the backstory\nand details for the new \"BioDerm\" race.  Starsiege players should remember the BioDerms.\nWell, they're back and they're really, really angry.  Something about a dead parrot.\n\n\nThe Writer's Guide should be out soon, probably around E3 or so.  For those of you lucky\nenough to see what we've cooked up for TRIBES II...pretty damn spiffy if I do say so \nmyself.  Muy swank.\n\n\nFor those who have asked about the origin of the \"Diamondback\" moniker: When first playing\nTRIBES, I was either going by my Quake nom du guerre (Count Fragula) or something off the \nWarren Zevon CDs I was listening to (Excitable Boy, Roland The Headless Thompson Gunner).\nFor a demo we were recording, BlakeH suggested that we try and use names that were more\n\"tribal.\"  Hmmm, tribal, I said, stroking my chin.  As fate would have it, I was going over\nbaseball scores at espn.com.  Hmmm, Arizona Diamondbacks, \"Diamondback\" -- works for me.  \nI was going to change it later, but \"dBack\" kinda caught on, and that's been my TRIBES\nnickname ever since.  And that, my friends, is the rest of the story.\n\n3.2.99\nNothing worse than scoring a City League career-high sixteen points (4-6 from behind\nthe arc too--dBack was \"en fuego\"), but losing the game.  Drat.  I'm lucky if I \nscore two points, it's too bad when Dave starts posting the big numbers and the\nteam can't capitalize...\n\n\nFar too silent of late, ol' dBack has decided to liven up your days with a guest \nappearance in the .plan files.  I know, I know, you're lives have been soooo empty\nwith the wit and wisdom of David R. here, so I come to appease the masses.\n\n\nAs of now, the Tribes team is starting to ramp up for Tribes II (or 2--personally,\nI prefer the Roman numerals), deciding what we can cram in for the sequel.  We'll\nno doubt have some things that didn't make it in the first game, and some wondrous\nnew things as well.\n\n\nAt present, I'm finishing up documentation for the tools that we will be releasing\nto the public sometime soon (and, no, I'm not getting more specific than that).  \nThis includes the Mission Editor and ZED, the in-house 3-D art tool that we used to\ncreate static objects.  The docs are in spiffy .html format with lots of cool \npictures and everything!  Very swank if I do say so myself (and I do)...we also\nhave tutelage for putting together your own \"smack packs\" using custom .wav files\nand implementing custom-made skins.  \n\n\nA big, big holler out to Dr. Jeep!!  You and Qui9 are truly *the men*!!  We'll have\nto slip a little something into Tribes II just for you...we shall be quaffing a \ngreat quanity to a certain beverage in the near future thanks to your magnanimousness\n(which may not be a word, but I said it, so it is now).\n\n \nAnd Sifl & Olly is back on the airwaves with brand new episodes!  Huzzah!  Who needs\na life, I have Sifl & Olly.\n\n1.27.99\nBack to the grind...always good to hear and see the reviews rolling in.  Good Lord, it\nlooks like we might have a hit on our hands.  This is much better than my former place\nof work, which shall go nameless, where I think our games sold a combined total of 32\ncopies...\n\n\nSo what is ol' dBack up to?  Making all you mod-makers happy soon.  Being writer-guy, \nI've been put in charge of making documentation for all of our tools that will be \nsoon be released.  That includes the Mission Editor, 3D Art tools, the skin maker...all \nthat jazz.  Not the most exciting stuff in the world, but hey, it pays the bills (and I\ngot plenty of those, believe you me).\n\n\n1.4.99\nTanned, rested and ready (well, at least rested), ol' dBack is back on the case.  \nTried to keep track of things on the message boards, but this was with my parents on \ntheir *shudder* Macintosh.  I love Macs, but a Performa with a 28.8 just don't cut it.  \nMaybe I'll get 'em an iMac for next Christmas.\n\n\nTrust all had a safe and happy holidays.  Partied like it was 1999 on New Year's with \nfriends at a certain establishment that shall go nameless but involved nubile young women \nin various states of undress.  Will not elaborate further (since I don't remember that \nmuch about it anyway).\n\n\nFirst things first: As soon as SymLink gets his sorry butt back from Hawaii or wherever \nhe is, we'll have an OpenGL patch out, as well as fixing our latest little problems.  As \nfor me, I've got design issues to work on, new missions, new races, more writing, etc., \netc...\n\n\nMaybe a Diamond Sword piece.

No, that is not a typo, over 100 brand-spanking-new missions for your fun and enjoyment.  This includes at least 15 (and probably more by the time you read this) Team vs. Our Very Nasty AI missions.

Which is, suffice it to say, a very long time.  We long-suffering OSU grads are just agog with the possibility of going to a bowl game.  My normal insufferability has been amped up about tenfold for all the UO grads here at Dynamix (and, lo, their numbers are legion).  Hail to the Beavers, hail to OSU...\n\n\nAlas, the mission editor calls my name.

We've made the .PNG our preferred texture format, which has simplified\nthings around here drastically.

This program is\nshaping up as a great alternative for image creation.

I couldn't grap the concept of curved surfaces and shaders. They just wouldn't come to me, at least not with the editing tools that were available when I last tried. It's too bad, because I used to love editing levels.\n\nThe other day I found myself with a laptop (from work) that had Windows 2000 installed. On a whim, I loaded WinQuake onto it, and found my old Worldcraft CD and gave it a try. It ran beautifully. I was back in familiar territory, and I remembered many long days and nights of building Quake levels back in '98.\n\nThe laptop got reassigned to a co-worker so I had to delete everything Quake-related from it. But for a few days, I was a younger kid on the forefront of a new gaming technology again.\n\nI miss the late nights spent playing NetQuake CTF with a bunch of regulars on a far-away server over a 28.8 modem connected at 21.6. I miss looking at the clock after a particularly exciting level and noticing that it's 5 a.m., and then remembering that I have an 8 a.m. class today. I miss long hours of IRC conversations with a bunch of abusive punks who were all as excited by being able to create new facets in gameplay as I was: Mike Wardwell, Mike Ruete, Yahn Bernier, Matthias Worch, Mattias Konradssen, Steve Fukuda, Steve Thoms, Wright Bagwell, and the myriad of others that I'm forgetting. I'm sure a few of these guys are still involved.\n\nNothing's simple. The community that seemed cohesive and yet sprawling back then has fragmented more and more as games seem to pour out of the woodworks. Editing any game requires learning a million little things specific to the game. My trials and tribulations trying to close leaks and get the lighting just right seem like nothing.\n\nDo you remember that first cubical room you made?

I think Jason was willing to lose\na couple hundred on the bet - that's not that big a deal. But $25,000\nis another matter entirely. See, I'm almost certain he didn't think \"Yeah,\nthere is no way in hell that Thresh can beat Craig.\" He probably thought,\n\"Hmm... Craig's pretty good. He might actually stand a chance against\nThresh.\" So he made the bet with that in mind. Since then, to hold his\nimage, he's raised the ante - ha, I've got a bigger dick than yours, 'cause\nI can bet more.\n\nIt all seems rather stupid to me. I just hope that whoever wins wins\ngraciously, no insulting, bickering, etc. And I hope that some of that\n$25,000, whoever wins it, comes my way for some new hardware which I\nneed rather desperately if I'm to continue making Quake levels.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges to creating Quake levels is exactly that, the\nhardware requirements. I'm lucky enough to have a computer than can handle\nit - a Gateway p120 with 32 megs RAM - but even that computer is on the low\nend of Quake editing machines. If I want to go into Quake2 editing in the\nfuture, I'm going to need something much more powerful, possibly even of the\npentium II variety. The money I'm making on the X-Men project isn't enough\nto purchase a machine of that caliber, but hopefully by the time Quake2\ncomes out, I will be able to afford what I need.\n\nOr I can just hope that Carmack does *something* with that strange talent he\nhas, and makes everything a lot less memory-intensive and time-consuming. :)\n\nThe next big thing: http://mauls.com/carbine/\n\n- Ryan \"BabelFish\" Freebern\nThe opinions expressed above are mine only, and do not in any way reflect\nthe opinions of my employer, Zero Gravity Entertainment, or the terraFORMA\nteam.

We kind of just blew by it \nand it was done before we hardly knew it was here, but that is the \nway most of Heretic II\u00c2\u0092s development has been.  This project is going \nalong smoother (knock on wood) than any project that I have worked on \nto date.  The team is working very hard to make sure that this game \nwill rock!\n\nA bunch of new skins have been implemented for the monsters.  They \nare looking really great.  There is a bunch of new screenshots \ncropping up from a press build of the game that we gave to a few \nindividuals recently.  Most of the sites that are posting new shots \nare taking them from that build (normally I take most of the shots \nand hand them out).  The point is that anyone that wants to see the \ngame shouldn\u00c2\u0092t have a problem finding screenshots any longer.\n\nSoldier of Fortune is moving along faster than I thought possible.  \nThey have several levels build architecturally already and are even \ndoing some scripting already.  It shouldn\u00c2\u0092t be much more than a month \nbefore an enemy makes a first appearance in the game.  We are playing \naround with some realistic settings in the game, like realistic \nfalling damage.  It is a very different feel than most of other fps, \nand it will take some getting used (if we keep it at all), but I \nthink the added feeling of realism could go a long way.  \n\n8/11/98\n\nThe time has come to update my plan again.  So much is happening that \nI don\u00c2\u0092t know where to begin.  \n\nI recently made a trip to Ireland to show Heretic II to the European \npress, buyers, and distributors.  It was a huge event that Activision \nUK hosted in order to show all of the upcoming products for the next \n6 - 8 months.  It went very well.  Heretic II was received with wide-\nopen arms.  As far as I can estimate, everyone loved the product \nacross the board.  So, if anyone at the show is reading this, thank \nyou for your support and attendance at Activate 98.  You will not be \ndisappointed. \n\nLast week I was at Gen Con, in Milwaukee.  That went extremely well. \nWe showed Heretic II, for the first time since E3, to the general \npublic.  Everyone was very excited about it.  I am convinced that if \nyou are still a doubter about Heretic II, when you play it you will \nbe converted.  A demo will be released in October some time.\n\nI want to thank everyone at Gen Con that I talked to, especially the \nguys at AEG and White Wolf.  They know why they are cool, so I don\u00c2\u0092t \nneed to clarify.\n\nSoF is moving right along.  Several levels have been built already, \nand the new monster AI is nearing completion.  Our animators are \nworking on weapons right now and some secret stuff with the monsters \n(more about this at a later date).  \n\nProject X is very close to announcement.  I know I have said this \nbefore, but this time it is true. I am expecting to lock things in at \nthe end of August or the first part of September.  When this happens \nwe will be making a major announcement about it.\n\n7/20/98\n\nI just wanted to send out my thanks to Comp USA.  I just won their \nmost recent trivia contest. For 2nd prize I won a Quantum 3D Obsidian \nS-12 Voodoo 2 card.  Very cool.  The best part is that they sent it \nFed Ex and I already have it.\n\n7/16/98\n\nOn Saturday, August 8th, Jeff Butler, Mark Nelson, and Kevin Long are \ngoing to be hanging out at the Heretic II/Activision booth at Gen Con.  \nAll three of these guys have done tons of work in the paper and pencil \nRPG world. Jeff and Mark are most noted probably for their work with \nTSR.  Kevin Long worked as both an artist and a writer for Pallidium \nGames.  So if you want to meet them, talk with them, or have them sign \nanything (OK almost anything) just stop by the booth at Gen Con (that \nis in Milwaukee Wisconsin).\n\nIn case you don\u00c2\u0092t know what Gen Con is, it is basically the E3 for the \nRPG universe.  It is a huge convention hosted by TSR every year in \nMilwaukee.  I think attendance was about 60,000 last year throughout \nthe weekend.  \n\nAll three of these guys did work for Heretic.  Jeff and Mark have \nactually done tons of work for the game.  Kevin has been working with \nthe Soldier of Fortune team for the most part, so he didn\u00c2\u0092t have the \nopportunity to do as much work but he has done some.  \n\n\n6/25/98\nUpdate time again.  I know that I haven\u00c2\u0092t updated this in a while but I \nonly do what I can.\n\nHeretic II\nWe went on a media tour for Heretic II just recently.  It was in New \nYork and San Francisco.  I would have made it to both, but I ended up \nin the hospital in NY for a day or so and I missed the SF part.  The \ntour went well, and we are expecting to see some coverage in a lot of \nthe trade magazines in the near future.  There was a nice full-page \nspread in Computer Gaming World\u00c2\u0092s newest issue (August issue I think it \nwas).  They also put Heretic in a caption on the cover.  So if your \ninterested take a look.  Like I said it is a nice article.  The screen \nshots are from the technology demo, but they are still very nice shots.\n\nMuch of the game is falling into place now, as we creep up on our \ndeadlines.  Most of the levels have architecture now and lighting, and \nmany of them have appropriate textures.  The monsters are popping into \nthe game faster than I can keep up sometimes.  I must say that some of \nthese latest monsters look incredible.  We have a creature now that can \njump in and out of the water, and maneuver in either location \nnaturally.   \n\nCorvus himself is looking pretty good.  He now has the proper \nanimations for swimming underwater and for most of his acrobatics.\n\nSorry I haven\u00c2\u0092t updated the Corvus journal in a while.  Things have \nbeen very busy around here.  I really hope to get to it soon and then \ndo a couple of them quickly.\n\nKeep your eyes open for the official Heretic II page to go live soon.  \nIt will have some very cool stuff on it that will not have been \navailable anywhere else before the sites debut.\n\nSoldier of Fortune\nSoldier of Fortune is looking really nice as well.  As you all probably \nalready know, they are doing hardware only and the effects that are \nbeing coded right now are taking full advantage of that.  \n\nWe are nearly finished with the design for SoF.  Just a few little \nthings to go over yet with Eric, Rick, and Scott.  I hope to have that \ndone next week. \n\nProject X\nWhat can I say?  Not much, so I guess I will leave it at that.  I hope that we \nwill be announcing something within the next two months, but we will just have \nto wait and see.\n\n6/1/98\nThe frantic scramble to get ready for E3 is finally over and the show is now \nover as \nwell.  For those of you that managed to make it to the show, thanks for stopping \nby and \nlooking at Heretic.  For those of you that didn\u00c2\u0092t make it to the show, you don\u00c2\u0092t \nknow \nwhat you missed.  Heretic was extremely well received by those that came by.  We \nwere \nshowing three levels of the game (basically the first hub, Silverspring).  \nCorvus has \nhis final skin in the game (for now) and he looks so good that Blue\u00c2\u0092s thought \nthat he \nwas bump mapped.  We had two monsters in the game; they were the plague Sidhe \nand the \ngiant rats.  Both were working pretty well, as was the combat.  I think what \neveryone \ncame back remembering about Heretic was the incredible animations that Corvus \nhad.  \nEveryone should give a round of applause to Brian Shubat, Jeff DeWitt (Corvus\u00c2\u0092s \nanimators), Pat Lipo, and Bob Love (Corvus\u00c2\u0092s programmers).  They did a great job \nin \ngetting him to the state that he is at now.\n\nI will be working on a new journal entry for Corvus this week.  I am hoping that \nI will \nhave it finished by the end of the week because I will be leaving for New York \nand San \nFrancisco for a Heretic II press tour.  If I don\u00c2\u0092t finish it in time, I will \npost it \nwhen I get back.\n\nSoldier of Fortune is making some progress.  E3 slowed down the production a \nlittle, \nsince Eric Biessman went to the show with us, but everything continues to move \nalong \nwell with the project.  \n\nProject 3 at Raven is nearing preparation for announcement.  It will be maybe a \nmonth \nor so before the announcement will be made.\n\nWhat I remember from the show:\n\nA couple of things about the show stand out in my memory.  Some of them are \nrelevant \nand some aren\u00c2\u0092t, but I will tell you all of them.  \n\nI remember having very sore feet, back, and wrists at the end of each day.  \nAnyone that \nhas spent 10 \u00c2\u0096 12 hours standing on a concrete floor that has only a layer of \ncarpet \nover it will tell you how sore your feet will get.  My hands a wrists were sore \nfrom \nplaying the game from a standing position.\n\nI remember seeing lots of models in tight clothes.  The Lara Croft model was \nthere (I \ngot my picture with her, being the geek that I am), as were several Metal Gear \nSolid \nmodels (whom I also struck up a cool pose with) and a Duke Nukem dude (this guy \nwas \nreally ripped, so I had to get a picture with him if for no other reason than \nperspective).  There was also a Sailer Moon dancer, and countless other models \nsponsoring various products.\n\nI met Gillian Anderson for about 2 seconds as she signed a post card.  I had to \nwait 2 \nhours in line for a post card! Can you believe that?  They could have at least \nhad her \nsign publicity photos of her.  \n\nI didn\u00c2\u0092t meet Bret Farve, but Bob Love was gracious enough to stand in line, \nwhile I \nworked, to get a signed picture of him in all of his glorious action.  \n\nGames that stand out in my mind:\n\nThe Half-Life demo looked sweet. They had a ton of cool scripted events going on \nlike a \nguy trying to climb up a rope that turns out to be a monster\u00c2\u0092s tongue.  He was \nswallowed when he reached the top.  This looks like it is going to be a cool \ngame.\n\nDrakon, published by Psygnosis, looks like it is going to be cool.  It is a 3rd \nperson \nfantasy game, but very different from Heretic. It doesn\u00c2\u0092t seem to be action \noriented, \nit seemed to be more geared towards an RPG.  Flying around on a dragon\u00c2\u0092s back \nand using \nit to fight was very cool to watch.  \n\nDuke Nukem Forever was running as a demo reel.  They had some cool stuff going \non like \nfighting from the back of a moving truck.\n\nTrespasser is as good as the screen shots make it seem.  I didn\u00c2\u0092t see any \ngameplay, but \nas a technology demo it looked awesome.\n\nWell if I think of anything else I will mention it later.\n\n5/11/98\nWell, someone has spilled the beans already and now as you all \nprobably know, one of our new projects is Soldier of Fortune.  \nThe game is the official licensed product of the Soldier of \nFortune magazine, so it is going to be awesome.  Watch for more \ninformation about the game, and you had better knock the dust off \nof that assault rifle you smuggled home from Desert Storm, \nbecause you are going to need it.\n\n5/7/98 \u00c2\u0096 B\n\nI just wanted to post to let everyone know that I have posted a \nnewer version of he Corvus Journal.  It is not a new entry, just \na cleaned up version of the other two entries.\n\n5/7/98\n\nHeretic II is moving along nicely towards E3.  The character has \na new skin and it looks pretty darn nice, although we are still \ngoing to be doing more work on it to make it even better looking.  \nThe software rendering is working, for the most part. It is still \na bit slow, but it looks pretty darn nice for running in \nsoftware.  The game is also now running on a V2x00 chip as well.  \nThere is still some work to be done in supporting most of the \nother 3d cards, but it looks really darn nice on the Thriller 3D. \nI have been repeatedly impressed with these cards.  I hope that \nmore games start to support them, whether through Direct X, Open \nGL, or their native drivers.  I have seen a few games that are \nusing Glide only, for their 3D acceleration, while this is great \nfor the frame rate of the game, they are missing a whole lot of \nother chipsets out there that could run their game.  Anyway, \nHeretic II is moving along nicely.\n\nProject Y and XXX are coming along through the design phase.  One \nis nearing official announcement so keep your ears pealed.  I am \nworking on the design doc of this project currently.  When the \ndesign reaches a level of stability, it will probably be \nannounced shortly thereafter.\n\nI\u00c2\u0092ve been playing Might and Magic VI lately. What a great CRPG.  \nIf you like CRPG\u00c2\u0092s you really should give it a try.  I have been \naddicted to it all week.  I\u00c2\u0092ve also been playing Spec Ops during \nmy lunch.  This game isn\u00c2\u0092t for everyone.  It is almost like a \nflight sim, but instead of a plane, it is a simulation of Army \nRangers.  It is a lot of fun, just don\u00c2\u0092t try to run through the \nlevels like a Quake 2 level.  I guarantee you will get \nslaughtered doing this.\n\nI\u00c2\u0092m reading Dune right now.  Yes I know, why haven\u00c2\u0092t I read it \nbefore?  It is a long story, but I\u00c2\u0092m reading it finally.  It is \nan interesting book, but a little slow. I\u00c2\u0092m also reading through \nthe new TSR game Alternity.  I am really impressed so far.  I \nthink I can say it is the best product that TSR has released in \nseveral years.  Maybe the WoC buy out will really do them a lot \nof good.\n\n4/27/98\n\nThe Corvus Journal has been updated!  So enjoy.\n\nProject Y. Well you all know the story, I\u00c2\u0092ll talk when we are good and \nready to talk.\n\nHeretic II.  There is an official Heretic II web ring now!  Very cool.  \nIt is great that so many people are excited about the game. I know \nthere have been a few of you that are still worried about the 3pp, but \njust give it time, you will come to see the error of your ways.  The \nnew character model is in and it looks pretty darn cool.  He has \nseveral animations already and is well on the way to being ready for \nE3.\n\nDid anyone see Merlin on NBC last night?  It was pretty cool.  I am \nlooking forward to seeing the rest of it tonight.  \n\n4/22/98\n\nWell, by know everyone probably already knows about the corporate \nshuffle game that we have been playing that has resulted in the loss of \na couple of people.  Due to these changes I will be working on all of \nthe Raven projects as Project Administrator.  This will keep me busy to \nsay the least, but I hope that I will still be able to continue working \non the Corvus Journals.  My goal is to be as involved with all of the \nprojects as I have been with Heretic II.  This may not be possible, \neven I only have so much time, but I am going to give it a shot.  I am \ngoing to have a meeting with the big wigs around here and go over my \nresponsibilities to all of the teams.  This stuff will have to come \nfirst, before the extra stuff.  Fear not though, if I don\u00c2\u0092t have time \nto keep the Corvus Journals coming often, I may be able to recruit some \nhelp from some of the other Heretic II team members to write sections \nof the journal and then I will just act as Editor and add my own \nsections as often as I can.  \n\nHeretic II is moving along.  We are getting a bunch of animations in \nfor Corvus, and we are hoping that he will have a skin again, in the \nnext couple of days.  We are well on our way to \nhaving a kick ass E3.\n\nI have been reading the message board at HexenWorld and am very happy \nto see that so many people find the story in a game to be a very \nimportant part of the game experience.  This has \nbeen something that I have been concerned about in the past.  It seemed \nfor a while that no one cared about the story anymore.  It was all \nabout the action and then whatever crappy \nstory was tacked on after the fact was fine.  But, I am getting a \ndifferent take on it based \non what you are all talking about.  Story is no substitute for \ngameplay, but the best games \nall have a great story in them.  Yes, you can have a game without a \nstory, but it just isn\u00c2\u0092t \nas good of a game as it could have been.\n\n\n4/16/99\n\nGeese, I can\u00c2\u0092t believe I haven\u00c2\u0092t updated in six days.  What the heck is \nthe matter with me?  I think my only excuse is that I have been writing \na lot lately and well um even I can only write so much.  As much as I \nwould like to be, I will probably never be Stephen King and pump out \nseveral books a year.  Hell, I would be happy if I could just publish \none book, but that may happen sooner than I would expect.  As long as I \nstay focused with my writing projects, who knows.\n\nI have been working on the cinematic scripts for Heretic II. The first \nis finished, I\u00c2\u0092m sure I will be re-writing them several times before we \ngive them to any voice actors.  I am also working on the next \ninstallment of the Corvus journals.  I hope that everyone has read the \nfirst one already.  I\u00c2\u0092m doing an interview with Gamespot later today,so \nyou can probably expect some kind of preview on their site soon. \n\nThe project is making slow, but reasonable progress right now.  We got \nstarted with a big bang, but things are settling in finally, a little \nbit at least.\n\nWell, I\u00c2\u0092ve got to go check on everyone\u00c2\u0092s progress.  Actually it is just \nan excuse to not write something right now.  Are there any writers out \nthere?  You know what it\u00c2\u0092s like when you just can\u00c2\u0092t seem to get \nyourself to write a damn thing, no matter how hard you try.  I think \nthat sometimes I lack inspiration.  Maybe someone can give me something \nthat will inspire me.  Maybe I\u00c2\u0092ll watch Blade Runner tonight, which \nalways inspires me.  If anyone has a better suggestion, please let me \nknow.\n\n4/10/98\n\nA blank page.

This is\ngoing to be one of the larger levels. \nNot That Anyone Cares notes:\nRun, don't walk, to your nearest bookseller\nand get Glenn Kleier's The Last Day, which is easily the best book I've read this year. Thoughtful, prosaic, and\ninsightful, Kleier spins a tale of millenium fever and second comings with the\nauthoritative voice found only in a handful of first-time novelists over the past several\nyears. I was literally up until dawn reading all 484 pages of this exciting and\nprovocative book -- and my only regret was that the story didn't go on for another 500\npages. \nI found The Last Day to be thoroughly\nbelievable, without a single false note. The action is swift and at times almost\nunbearable in its suspense. Couple this with profound insights into human character, and\nyou have not just your typical action-suspense thriller, but a very deep and moving\nexamination of our society at the end of the 20th century. \nWhat I'm Reading: Jack Faust by Michael\nSwanwick.\n6:42 PM 11/24/97\nBack to finishing up King Minos' palace.\nVoin has produced some beautiful statues which Chuck is skinning with exquisite attention\nto detail. I can't wait to put some of them in the levels.\nCongratulations to Steve Rescoe, fellow\nDaikatana designer, for having the number one Quake level ever at MeccaWorld, Shadow\nOver Innsmouth.

I've received about 20 e-mails already\nrecommending books. Many thanks, and sure, keep them coming. Almost all have recommended\nRobert Jordan's Wheel of Time series -- so I'll go ahead and let\nyou all know that I've read (and love) them all up to Fires of Heaven.\nI've got the other three, but haven't gotten around to them yet.\nI started The Labyrinth (level 7).

Wow. I\nthought I was this film's biggest defender. (I did say it was a \"great\nfilm,\" I believe.) Except for some logic problems, I thought the story was extremely\nwell done, and I loved its satiric bite. I give it an A-.\nAnother e-mail asked if I really read or\nfinish the books I say I'm reading. Hmmpf. Yes, I do. I suppose some folks find it\nimprobable that a 300 page novel can be read in three or four days. I usually get through\ntwo or three books a week; not because I'm a genius, but because I like to read. I don't\nwatch television, except for the X-Files and sometimes The\nSimpsons, so my leisure time is spent with books. I'm not dissing anyone who\nwatches a lot of television -- I just prefer books. I like Science Fiction and Fantasy,\nMainstream, Horror, and non-fiction on astronomy, cosmology, quantum mechanics, and\npaleontology. I'm usually in the middle of a couple of books at a time, but this is a bad\nhabit I seem unable to break.\u00c2\u00a0 I've had many enjoyable discussions with folks who've\nwritten and said \"Hey,\u00c2\u00a0 I read that book... blah blah\" or \"Hmm. Never\nheard of that, though I like the author. Any good?\" So I'll continue to list what I'm\nreading when I think about it. I wish I got more e-mail about books, since I'm always\nlooking for a cool new author.\nThanks for your e-mails. Now back to actual\nwork.\n1:40 PM 11/10/97\nMany thanks for the birthday wishes from my\nfriends in the gaming community. I've gotten sentimental in my dotage, and these things\nmean a lot (two words, by the way) to me. <sniff>\nWhat I'm reading: The Prestige\nby Christopher Priest\n5:00 PM 11/07/97\nStarship Troopers is a\ngreat film. Besides having the best special effects I've ever seen, the perspective is a\nbrilliant turnabout on Heinlein's vision of a society whose members must serve two years\nactive service in order to become citizens (only citizens can vote). Verhoeven shows that\nsociety as a fascist state, which is exactly what we would have had if Heinlein's vision\nhad come to fruition. Anyway, nevermind the deep stuff. I agree with others that the\nacting was only fair, charactization thin, and motivation poorly explained. So what? It's\na bug movie. It's not better than Aliens or as intelligent as Contact:\nbut it's the best action/sci-fi film of the year.\nGame wise, King Minos's Palace is turning\nout wonderfully, thanks to Chuck's textures. I've had some nice comments on the screen\nshots of Athens and the Acropolis (even though the shots are old), though one complaint\nI've heard (and share myself) is that the levels are awfully white. It has been my\nintention for a long time to get some color into the place. We're used to seeing the Greek\ntemples in their denuded, ruin states: mostly white marble and stone. Naturally, over the\ncourse of a couple thousand years, any paint remnants are long gone, except for scraps\nhere and there. But it is well known that the Greeks accented their temples with bright\ncolors, particularly the pediment and entablature. So for the Acropolis, I've been working\nwith photographs and maps to get the buildings and topography down pretty much to scale.\nOf course, I have to take some liberties here and there, since I'm obliged to keep the\nface count and Quake's draworder in mind. There's also the matter of gameplay\nto consider. Sure, you might think any goof with a map editor and some architecture books\ncan sit down and recreate the Acropolis perfectly. My goal is to recreate Ancient Greece convincingly\n-- while at the same time balancing practicality (the Quake engine's limitations), game\nflow, strategy, and fun.\nWhy all the bother with historical\naccuracy? Well, as Eric Idle has said, \"It's just as easy to get these things\nright.\" Besides that, it's fun! \nHappy birthday to me, too. Today I'm ...\nwell ... I bought Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band the day it\ncame out with money from my paper route. That's vague enough.\nWhat I'm reading: Timequake\nby Kurt Vonnegut.\n12:30 AM 10/17/97\nFinished The Parthenon, started King Minos'\npalace. Only two more levels to go after this.\nWhat I'm reading: How the Mind\nWorks by Steven Pinker.\n8:34 PM 10/11/97\nSince Shawn added some really swell\nlighting effects that we requested a couple months back, I've been finding incredibly\nsubtle ways to light levels and achieve a realistic mix of shadow and ambience. I thought\nI was really hot shit with this until Sverre showed me a little trick he's been using in\nhis San Francisco levels. The effect has made all the difference in Medusa's lair, which\nwas giving me mood fits. Either the shadows were too dark, loosing a lot of the little\ndetail bits -- or it was too light, which wasn't creepy enough. Now it's exactly what I\nwanted.\n5:28 PM 10/07/97\nOur new texture dude, Chuck Crist, is\namazing. He's a real pixel-artist, and has consistently stunned me with new stuff every\nday. Forget everything you've seen before in the Greek levels. Oh, the architecture will\nhave few changes, but Chuck's work is every level designer's dream. A really good set of\ntextures can inspire level design in ways too myriad to explain. Some of you know what I'm\ntalking about.\nps: There's no shame in therapy.\nWhat I'm reading: Underworld by Don\nDeLillo.\n2:15 PM 9/23/97\nStarted the fifth level, The Parthenon.\nThis is going to be one of the really cool and tough levels, featuring two bosses. This is\nthe first level where I can take some extreme liberties with the architecture, since it\ntakes place totally underground, and will feature Medusa's lair. Been looking forward to\nthis one.\nWhat I'm reading: Excession by Iain\nM. Banks.\n12:04 PM 9/18/97\nBack from ECTS, which went extremely well\nfor Daikatana. The press and gaming community were very receptive. Of course, the British\npress have been very generous to Daikatana all along. Hey, I even got interviewed by The\nIndependent, one of London's biggest newspapers.\nBeing in London during Princess Diana's\nfuneral was something other than else. I've written a photo-feature on my observations of\nBritain's farewell to Diana for Ion Storm's Daily Informant, if anyone cares to\nread it:\nhttp://www.ionstorm.com/eos/Di/diana.html\n\nAs for actual gaming stuff, I'm still\nworking on the Acropolis. The Parthenon is going to be tough to create realistically,\nsince it's so huge. Sverre keeps reminding me not to fall into the trap of keeping things\nTOO realistic.\nWhat I'm Reading: Saint Leibowitz and\nthe Wild Horse Woman by Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n9:31 PM 9/3/97\nI've been so busy getting ready for ECTS\nthat I forgot to give my 311 Clan mate Kornelia a big congratulations for winning the AFT!\nA big, belated \"Way to go, Kornelia!\" \nxxx\n2:17 PM 9/2/97\nThe Levelord does me great honor, but he is\ntoo modest. I'm sure that any level he does will knock them dead at ECTS. I'm certainly\nlooking forward to the show in London, but it looks as though we'll spend a somber\nSaturday due to Princess Diana's funeral entourage. Very tragic. A truly wonderful Lady. \n6:01 PM 8/30/97\nGetting Athens ready for ECTS. Reading: How\nto Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie.\n6:41 PM 8/27/97\nFrom The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy,\n2nd Edition Revised and Updated, p. 415: coolie -- an unskilled laborer or porter\nin eastern Asia.

Even \nso, I think the game code was the most complex of all this \nstuff.  Probably about 80% of the animation blending work \nwas done by BLong.\n\nOne cool feature that slipped in is a light preview mode in\nDEdit.  You basically can load the lighting and go through\nyour level in DEdit to preview the lighting.\n\nAnother thing that got in is a way to manually edit the \nlightmaps in DEdit.  You can directly tweak and edit the \npixels in the lightmaps in realtime in DEdit, then save the \nlighting data back out.

This was necessary because the \ngame code needed to do a lot of math for light animations \nbut couldn't use any of the engine's normal interfaces \n(because it was being called by the preprocessor).  \n\nI LOVE the way the engine's interfaces are evolving.. we \nused to have 2 enormous interfaces called ClientDE and \nServerDE (Lithtech used to be called DirectEngine, that's \nwhy they end in DE).  These interfaces shared a lot of the \nsame functions and got ugly.  Nowadays, they're getting \nslimmer and slimmer.\n\n-- everything below is not relevant to Lithtech2 --\n\nI'm on a mission now to only eat proteins for two weeks.  \nThere's a low-carbohydrate diet that is taking Lith by \nstorm, and since I tried it, I've felt 100x better.

Not that anything resembling \nthat happened to me last Wednesday.\n\nWell, I flew to L.A. a few months ago to see Tom Waits and \nnow it turns out he's coming to Seattle for two nights in \nOctober!  I was up at 8:30 the morning they went on sale \nbanging on my browser's Refresh button like I was playing \nTrack and Field, and I scored 10 tickets in the orchestra \nsection.\n\n\n8/24/99\n\nTime for a quick update:\n\nThe first iteration of the terrain functionality is in now.\nWes has been busting out cool terrain levels for a while \nand everything is proceeding smoothly.  I know I will have\nto revisit terrain a couple times in the next couple months\nto get it better and better, but the hardest part is over.\n\nAs part of the terrain work, the engine's top-level search\nstructure is a quadtree instead of a BSP tree now.  \n(Changing to an octree is very easy, but we don't \nneed it for NOLF).  This comes in handy, is faster for \ncertain operations, and handles non-indoor games better \nthan a BSP as well, so I'm glad this got in.\n\nWhile working on model LOD, I found a way to rework the \nskeletal animation loop to be MUCH faster.  I can't believe\nI missed this before.. it was so obvious, but it's a relief\nto have the LT2 models rendering at the speed one would\nexpect.\n\nI'm very pleased with the way the model LOD came out.  It's\nmuch simpler than the Shogo method (which was similar to\nIntel MRM) and is a lot more efficient.  In the game, we\nwill be using a set LOD offset for each GAME detail level\n(ultra-high, high, medium, low), and the animators can \ntweak out what each version will look like.  The\ntransitions between LODs are smoothed out so you can only\ntell it's doing LOD if you really look hard.\n\nThe model rendering will get another pass in the not too \ndistant future, and I'm expecting even more performance\ngains.  Sometimes this kind of thing bites me in the ass\nthough.. envision this scenario, \"I am specifying 1/3 of\nthe vertices as before, but it renders slower!\"  Or how\nabout, \"I removed 20% of the transforms, but it renders\nslower!\"  There are those who say there's a reason for\neverything, and there are those who use 3D APIs...\n\nPrimary things left to address for LT2 (I'm leaving these\nextremely general because I'm sure I'll end up doing the\nexact opposite of whatever I say here :)\n- Lighting enhancements\n- Networking\n- Mods\n- More model optimizations\n- More terrain optimizations\n- General renderer optimizations.. I have some ideas \nthat I'm very excited about\n\nI saw Ministry last weekend and it was an awesome show,\nway better than their last one.  At the last one, Al just\nsat there in a chair and barely moved, at this one, they\nall went nuts.  They even played Supernaut!  I almost got\nmyself perished in the pit but it was fun as hell.\n\nEmails are coming in about once a minute... I really wish\nOutlook had a way you could tell it to only check for email\nevery X minutes, or only let high-priority email through.\nThe little email icon that comes up in my taskbar when I\nget an email feels like an eye staring at me, daring me \nto ignore it..\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t6/23/99\n\nTime for an update about E3.  I've been amazed at all the \ninterest in Lithtech that E3 generated.  Here's an article \nI can't argue with:\n\nhttp://www.voodooextreme.com/articles/E3_99/\n\nI can't really pick one thing I saw as the most \nimpressive... it all sort of blended together.  The things \nthat stick out in my mind are Drakan, Anachronox, and 3rd \nLaw's Psycho Circus game.  3rd Law just released this video:\n\nhttp://www.bluesnews.com/files/kiss/kiss_e3-99_indeo51.shtml\n\nI couldn't believe the hordes of monsters in their game.. \nyou have to see it to believe it.  If I had a Men of the \nYear award, the 3rd Law team would get it.\n\nThe most memorable events I have of the E3 trip are:\n\n1. I busted half a move.  In my vocabulary, busting a move \nis getting a phone number from a girl you don't know.  \nBusting half a move is complimenting them but not having \nthe balls to get the number.\n\n2. We played pool in a bar next to Jamie Fox.\n\n3. Jason, Chris and I had just finished up a nice meal and \nwere stepping out of the restaurant on the Santa Monica \nPromenade when we saw some lights flicker about half a\nblock down.  We all looked, then there was a HUGE (3 story \nhigh) explosion in which a manhole cover was blown out of \nsight.  The first thing I remember is feeling a heat wave.\nThe next thing was seeing the crowd go into panic mode.  We \nstood around for a little, then got up closer to see that a \nhole about 10 feet in diameter had been blown in the\nroad.  Apparently a gas pipe had exploded.  The square \npiece of metal that holds the round manhole cover in place \nwas jammed in the road sideways so it looked like a diamond \nsitting on one of its edges.\n\nAfter E3, Joel and I were at Universal Studios \nat 'Creativity', at which there were a bunch of informative \ntalks.  It's good that the people that populate the video \ncard companies are cool since we have to spend so much time \nwith them :)\n\nLithtech2 is proceeding along nicely.  Among other things, \nS3 texture compression is in now which reduces our texture \nfile sizes and will make a big difference on cards that \nsupport it.  I was amazed at the quality of S3's texture \ncompression library, I can't even tell the difference \nbetween uncompressed and compressed textures (but then \nmaybe that's because I don't want to see it :)  Just in \ncase, each texture can be stored as compressed or \nuncompressed.\n\nJonathan and I went to a Tom Waits show in L.A. last week,\nit was totally awesome!  After 2 1/2 hours and 3 encores I \ncould've sat there for another 10 hours.  We saw Chuck \nWeiss and Benicio Del Toro hanging out in the lobby too.  \nOur seats were pretty far back (and security was tight!) so \nwe didn't have a very good view, but I got the first hour \nor so on tape!\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t4/19/99\n\nLithtech2 development is proceeding far faster than I \nexpected.  At this point, it's like night and day compared \nto where it was a few months ago.  Cool features are \ngetting added every day.  What's cool is that the R&D will \ncontinue for at least the next few months.\n\nIt's interesting to see the Lithtech API evolve over time.  \nWe've experimented with so many styles and ways of \nstructuring things that the API has looked very different \nat different times.  As it moves on, I can see it steering \na course between speed, complexity, usability, and \nconsistency.\n\nOur Lithtech2 E3 demo is looking AWESOME.  It's very \noutdoors-ish.  It's already looking much better than I had \nenvisioned.  While not \"2 years before its chosen time\", \nthis demo will pump fear.\n\nI'm psyched to see 3rd Law's (Bloodshot's) game at E3.  \nFrom what I've seen so far, it's looking great.  It has \nbeen great working with these guys, it's obvious they have \na lot of experience and know their shit.  Their game will \nkick ass so keep an eye on it.\n\nA few of the new developments...\n\nSkeletal animation is working great so far.  Each model can \nnow have multiple textures assigned to it as well.  M.A. is \npimping out models with shared animation sets.\n\nSupport for 32-bit textures and screen surfaces has been in \nfor a while.  I'm very happy with the way it's structured.. \nall the color conversion code was strewn out before but now \nit is cenralized, clean, and simple.  It's definitely \nbetter to be using 32-bit textures and a 16-bit screen than \n16-bit textures and a 32-bit screen.\n\nThe TNT2 owns me.  It's very interesting to be working in \nthis paradigm where the card isn't the bottleneck anymore.  \nThe bottleneck is much more on the processor and data \nstructure side.  The biggest overall change in Lithtech2 \nwill be to support the kind of rich environment that we can \nnow render in the networking, tools, and physics.\n\nWe have a SoftImage terrain exporter now.  This is a huge \nleap over the previous way we made terrains.  It's much \nfaster and easier to texture and manipulate the terrains in \nSoft.  \n\nThere are some new tricks the preprocessor does to optimize \nthe terrains.  It can sometimes strip out 65% of the polies \non the terrain with no noticeable difference.\n\nDetail textures really enhance the look of our terrain.  It \nreally makes the texture on the terrain look larger and \nmore detailed.  The goods...\n\nThe model lighting is much more accurate now.  Models can \nbe lit accurately from lights placed in the environment, so \nyou can get nice subtle bits of light all over them.\n\nWe're playing around with different blending modes that \nwork well for things like the sun and clouds passing \noverhead.  I'll describe this better later.\n\nWe've got some cool time of day effects going in.  The \nentire world gets lit directionally as the sun passes \nover.  Model lighting and shadows tilt around as the sun \nmoves.  The entire terrain gets lit as well.\n\nThere's a new type of object called a Canvas that allows \nthe game to render polies directly.  \n\nThis allows for some cool effects like lightning, fire, \nglass shattering, etc..\n\nPultzar hasn't been messing around at all.  DEdit is \ngetting friendlier and friendlier all the time.  The node \nnames in the node view can be set to show the class name or \nobject name.  You can mirror brushes.  There are sphere and dome primitives.  There are browse dialogs for filenames, \netc..\n\nBouwman's been working on improving the visible surface \ndetermination for Sanity.  There have been major speed \nimprovements on that game already and he's not even done \nyet.\n\nCountdown to Mule Variations: 8 days\n\n\n\n\n \n3/13/99\n\nJust finishing up the implementation of skeletal animation \nfor Lithtech 2. This will REALLY help our games have more \nmodels with better animation. There are several key \nadvantages of skeletal animation we'll be using extensively\nin our LT2 game:\n \nShared animation sets - Models with the same skeleton can \nshare animation sets.  This will save the animators TONS of \ntime in exporting and tweaking animations.  This also \nallows us to change the geometry of the character very \neasily without changing the animation. \n \nMemory savings - Skeletal animation itself cuts the memory \nrequirements of model animation down by a factor of 2-3.  \nUsing shared animation sets should halve it again.  \nBasically, animation memory will NOT be a problem!\n\nRotatable nodes at runtime - This will allow us to move \ncharacter heads, eyes, limbs, and mouths independent of the \nanimation they're playing.  One thing we might expe"}, {"by": "dussault@lith.com", "time": 939077640, "contents": "\n*** Monolith Production's Finger Server\n\nUser name: dussault\nPlan modified: Mon Oct 04 17:46:52 1999\n\n\t\t\t\t10/4/99\n\nThe coolest thing that got in lately is lightmap \nanimations.  Basically, we can now get shadowed effects for \na bunch of things in the environment:\n\n- When doors open, light floods out.\n- Flickering lights in the environment cast shadows.\n- Keyframed objects and lights cast shadows on things.\n- As the sun rotates over the world, the shadows on \neverything move.\n\nI'll be working on Certain Cool Enhancements to this next \nweek!\n\nI must say again how impressed I am by Third Law.  They \nnever cease to amaze me.  In addition to building their \ngame, they've added a ton of awesome features to their \nversion of the engine.  I can't believe how fast these guys \nwork!  \n\nDX7 is in now.

Not that anything resembling \nthat happened to me last Wednesday.\n\nWell, I flew to L.A. a few months ago to see Tom Waits and \nnow it turns out he's coming to Seattle for two nights in \nOctober!  I was up at 8:30 the morning they went on sale \nbanging on my browser's Refresh button like I was playing \nTrack and Field, and I scored 10 tickets in the orchestra \nsection.\n\n\n8/24/99\n\nTime for a quick update:\n\nThe first iteration of the terrain functionality is in now.\nWes has been busting out cool terrain levels for a while \nand everything is proceeding smoothly.  I know I will have\nto revisit terrain a couple times in the next couple months\nto get it better and better, but the hardest part is over.\n\nAs part of the terrain work, the engine's top-level search\nstructure is a quadtree instead of a BSP tree now.  \n(Changing to an octree is very easy, but we don't \nneed it for NOLF).  This comes in handy, is faster for \ncertain operations, and handles non-indoor games better \nthan a BSP as well, so I'm glad this got in.\n\nWhile working on model LOD, I found a way to rework the \nskeletal animation loop to be MUCH faster.  I can't believe\nI missed this before.. it was so obvious, but it's a relief\nto have the LT2 models rendering at the speed one would\nexpect.\n\nI'm very pleased with the way the model LOD came out.  It's\nmuch simpler than the Shogo method (which was similar to\nIntel MRM) and is a lot more efficient.  In the game, we\nwill be using a set LOD offset for each GAME detail level\n(ultra-high, high, medium, low), and the animators can \ntweak out what each version will look like.  The\ntransitions between LODs are smoothed out so you can only\ntell it's doing LOD if you really look hard.\n\nThe model rendering will get another pass in the not too \ndistant future, and I'm expecting even more performance\ngains.  Sometimes this kind of thing bites me in the ass\nthough.. envision this scenario, \"I am specifying 1/3 of\nthe vertices as before, but it renders slower!\"  Or how\nabout, \"I removed 20% of the transforms, but it renders\nslower!\"  There are those who say there's a reason for\neverything, and there are those who use 3D APIs...\n\nPrimary things left to address for LT2 (I'm leaving these\nextremely general because I'm sure I'll end up doing the\nexact opposite of whatever I say here :)\n- Lighting enhancements\n- Networking\n- Mods\n- More model optimizations\n- More terrain optimizations\n- General renderer optimizations.. I have some ideas \nthat I'm very excited about\n\nI saw Ministry last weekend and it was an awesome show,\nway better than their last one.  At the last one, Al just\nsat there in a chair and barely moved, at this one, they\nall went nuts.  They even played Supernaut!  I almost got\nmyself perished in the pit but it was fun as hell.\n\nEmails are coming in about once a minute... I really wish\nOutlook had a way you could tell it to only check for email\nevery X minutes, or only let high-priority email through.\nThe little email icon that comes up in my taskbar when I\nget an email feels like an eye staring at me, daring me \nto ignore it..\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t6/23/99\n\nTime for an update about E3.  I've been amazed at all the \ninterest in Lithtech that E3 generated.  Here's an article \nI can't argue with:\n\nhttp://www.voodooextreme.com/articles/E3_99/\n\nI can't really pick one thing I saw as the most \nimpressive... it all sort of blended together.  The things \nthat stick out in my mind are Drakan, Anachronox, and 3rd \nLaw's Psycho Circus game.  3rd Law just released this video:\n\nhttp://www.bluesnews.com/files/kiss/kiss_e3-99_indeo51.shtml\n\nI couldn't believe the hordes of monsters in their game.. \nyou have to see it to believe it.  If I had a Men of the \nYear award, the 3rd Law team would get it.\n\nThe most memorable events I have of the E3 trip are:\n\n1. I busted half a move.  In my vocabulary, busting a move \nis getting a phone number from a girl you don't know.  \nBusting half a move is complimenting them but not having \nthe balls to get the number.\n\n2. We played pool in a bar next to Jamie Fox.\n\n3. Jason, Chris and I had just finished up a nice meal and \nwere stepping out of the restaurant on the Santa Monica \nPromenade when we saw some lights flicker about half a\nblock down.  We all looked, then there was a HUGE (3 story \nhigh) explosion in which a manhole cover was blown out of \nsight.  The first thing I remember is feeling a heat wave.\nThe next thing was seeing the crowd go into panic mode.  We \nstood around for a little, then got up closer to see that a \nhole about 10 feet in diameter had been blown in the\nroad.  Apparently a gas pipe had exploded.  The square \npiece of metal that holds the round manhole cover in place \nwas jammed in the road sideways so it looked like a diamond \nsitting on one of its edges.\n\nAfter E3, Joel and I were at Universal Studios \nat 'Creativity', at which there were a bunch of informative \ntalks.  It's good that the people that populate the video \ncard companies are cool since we have to spend so much time \nwith them :)\n\nLithtech2 is proceeding along nicely.  Among other things, \nS3 texture compression is in now which reduces our texture \nfile sizes and will make a big difference on cards that \nsupport it.  I was amazed at the quality of S3's texture \ncompression library, I can't even tell the difference \nbetween uncompressed and compressed textures (but then \nmaybe that's because I don't want to see it :)  Just in \ncase, each texture can be stored as compressed or \nuncompressed.\n\nJonathan and I went to a Tom Waits show in L.A. last week,\nit was totally awesome!  After 2 1/2 hours and 3 encores I \ncould've sat there for another 10 hours.  We saw Chuck \nWeiss and Benicio Del Toro hanging out in the lobby too.  \nOur seats were pretty far back (and security was tight!) so \nwe didn't have a very good view, but I got the first hour \nor so on tape!\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t4/19/99\n\nLithtech2 development is proceeding far faster than I \nexpected.  At this point, it's like night and day compared \nto where it was a few months ago.  Cool features are \ngetting added every day.  What's cool is that the R&D will \ncontinue for at least the next few months.\n\nIt's interesting to see the Lithtech API evolve over time.  \nWe've experimented with so many styles and ways of \nstructuring things that the API has looked very different \nat different times.  As it moves on, I can see it steering \na course between speed, complexity, usability, and \nconsistency.\n\nOur Lithtech2 E3 demo is looking AWESOME.  It's very \noutdoors-ish.  It's already looking much better than I had \nenvisioned.  While not \"2 years before its chosen time\", \nthis demo will pump fear.\n\nI'm psyched to see 3rd Law's (Bloodshot's) game at E3.  \nFrom what I've seen so far, it's looking great.  It has \nbeen great working with these guys, it's obvious they have \na lot of experience and know their shit.  Their game will \nkick ass so keep an eye on it.\n\nA few of the new developments...\n\nSkeletal animation is working great so far.  Each model can \nnow have multiple textures assigned to it as well.  M.A. is \npimping out models with shared animation sets.\n\nSupport for 32-bit textures and screen surfaces has been in \nfor a while.  I'm very happy with the way it's structured.. \nall the color conversion code was strewn out before but now \nit is cenralized, clean, and simple.  It's definitely \nbetter to be using 32-bit textures and a 16-bit screen than \n16-bit textures and a 32-bit screen.\n\nThe TNT2 owns me.  It's very interesting to be working in \nthis paradigm where the card isn't the bottleneck anymore.  \nThe bottleneck is much more on the processor and data \nstructure side.  The biggest overall change in Lithtech2 \nwill be to support the kind of rich environment that we can \nnow render in the networking, tools, and physics.\n\nWe have a SoftImage terrain exporter now.  This is a huge \nleap over the previous way we made terrains.  It's much \nfaster and easier to texture and manipulate the terrains in \nSoft.  \n\nThere are some new tricks the preprocessor does to optimize \nthe terrains.  It can sometimes strip out 65% of the polies \non the terrain with no noticeable difference.\n\nDetail textures really enhance the look of our terrain.  It \nreally makes the texture on the terrain look larger and \nmore detailed.  The goods...\n\nThe model lighting is much more accurate now.  Models can \nbe lit accurately from lights placed in the environment, so \nyou can get nice subtle bits of light all over them.\n\nWe're playing around with different blending modes that \nwork well for things like the sun and clouds passing \noverhead.  I'll describe this better later.\n\nWe've got some cool time of day effects going in.  The \nentire world gets lit directionally as the sun passes \nover.  Model lighting and shadows tilt around as the sun \nmoves.  The entire terrain gets lit as well.\n\nThere's a new type of object called a Canvas that allows \nthe game to render polies directly.  \n\nThis allows for some cool effects like lightning, fire, \nglass shattering, etc..\n\nPultzar hasn't been messing around at all.  DEdit is \ngetting friendlier and friendlier all the time.  The node \nnames in the node view can be set to show the class name or \nobject name.  You can mirror brushes.  There are sphere and dome primitives.  There are browse dialogs for filenames, \netc..\n\nBouwman's been working on improving the visible surface \ndetermination for Sanity.  There have been major speed \nimprovements on that game already and he's not even done \nyet.\n\nCountdown to Mule Variations: 8 days\n\n\n\n\n \n3/13/99\n\nJust finishing up the implementation of skeletal animation \nfor Lithtech 2. This will REALLY help our games have more \nmodels with better animation. There are several key \nadvantages of skeletal animation we'll be using extensively\nin our LT2 game:\n \nShared animation sets - Models with the same skeleton can \nshare animation sets.  This will save the animators TONS of \ntime in exporting and tweaking animations.  This also \nallows us to change the geometry of the character very \neasily without changing the animation. \n \nMemory savings - Skeletal animation itself cuts the memory \nrequirements of model animation down by a factor of 2-3.  \nUsing shared animation sets should halve it again.  \nBasically, animation memory will NOT be a problem!\n\nRotatable nodes at runtime - This will allow us to move \ncharacter heads, eyes, limbs, and mouths independent of the \nanimation they're playing.  One thing we might experiment \nwith is a 'ragdoll' mode a model can be put into where \ntheir bones use realistic physics without any specific \nanimation being played for infinite variety in the \ncharacter deaths and recoils.\n \nThe attachment system is being reworked to allow MUCH more \nflexibility. Attachments points on models used to be \ngeometry nodes in the model.  This took up lots of memory \nfor the extra animation data.  Now, the 'sockets' will \nsimply be a position and rotation offset from a bone in the \nmodel.  This means we can have MANY more attachment points \nfor free and they can be repositioned inside ModelEdit very \neasily.\n\nOther than that, LT2 is proceeding very nicely.  There are \nnew optimizations in the preprocessor that help reduce the \nfinal poly count a LOT.\n\nPultzar is on DEdit now - the new DEdit is kicking butt.\n\nWe now have model exporters for these modeling packages: \nSoftImage, 3DSMAX, Lightwave, and Maya.   \n\nThe next few months are going to be heavy graphics R&D.  \nI'll describe the specifics of the features we're doing \nlater (doing want to speak too soon :).\n\n\n \n"}, {"by": "ebiessman@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 1023984480, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Eric Biessman\nEmail: ebiessman@ravensoft.com\nDescription: Prime Minister\nProject: Quake 4\nLast Updated: 06/13/2002 12:47:45 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6-13-02\t\n\nJust a reminder...\n\nDESIGNER SEARCH\n\nRaven Software is looking for talented individuals to work on \nAAA-quality next generation console and PC titles.

 every creature, vehicle, power-up, and character is designed.  so that's cool...now i get to model tweak and texture a bunch of them (along with kevin).  all of the chosen are completely modeled and textured, and they all look pretty rad if i do say so myself.  the engine is starting to run fast and can only get better as the engineers do more optimizations.  scott schlegel's hair is now orange.  i'm working on a bunch of art for a big article in an upcoming magazine...hopefully we'll have the cover and  a whole bunch of stuff on the inside.  when i get more info i let everbody know what mag it will be and when it will be out.  there is going to be some sweet renderings of in game objects and characters (that is, if the layout guy at the mag puts them into the article).  \n     based on the what you folks had to say on the blood forum about the picture of ophelia, i tweaked her design a bit.  no i didn't give her 38DD's or long hair.  i did however change her clothes some so they would be more recognizable.  no more space suit (actually, a motorcycle racing suit)...now she has a leather racing jacket, chaps, and boots.  i think she looks pretty good...and i'll be interested to hear what you all think when we can release a picture of her.\n     on a personal note, two days ago a got the DSarms FN FAL .308 rifle i had ordered a few month ago.  i took it to the range and shot it...that baby was smooth as warm butter.  from the factory it was dropping rounds right into the black...it is a hell of alot more accurate than i am in any case.  \n\n\nlater,\n\nrico\n\n\n\n\n9/5/97\n\nit's been awhile since i did my last update...to all those people who read my file (i've got to imagine there are at least two of you out there), i'm sorry...really.  anyway, here's the scoop...i've been working designing a bunch of different things for the game (obviously), every thing from the level one characters and boss(who is going to be very cool if i do say so myself) to the majority of the firearms the player will be able to use.  as i siad in my first plan, i would like to be able to show all of this stuff off to you gaming nuts to see what ya'll think.  i was originally gonna do my own page, but now the pros have stepped in and offered to do a full fledged BLOOD II page.  we are shooting for that page to be up in about two months.  that should give us the time to develop other aspects of the page (back story, technical briefs, etc.) and give me enough time to stock up on the concept art.  i'm hoping to update my little concept section of the page every two weeks of so.  how does that sound?\n\nlater, eric\n\n\n8/1/97\n\nthanks to everybody who responded to my question!  it warmed the fuzzy little cockles of my heart to hear there are that many people out there who give a rat's ass about the work i'm doing.  me and jay wilson are talking about what we want to do about the web site right now...we might just go ahead and start an official blood2 site sooner than we originally thought and include a concept section that i could add stuff to on regular basis.  we'll see, if we do a REAL site then we get to have the monolith web doodz design the page, and i garauntee that it would be much cooler than anything yours truly would pull off.  i'll keep ya'll posted.  \n\nso i've been thinking about breasts lately.  i know your first thought is...eric, why have you been thinking about breasts, and more importantly, why are you telling me about it?  well, i answer, the last few weeks i have been designing some of the characters in blood2, and several of them are, obviously, female.  i've been looking around at the females in other games and comics and what do you think i found?  every single one of them looks like some silicon injected, lypo sunctioned, fake baked, frankentitty bimbo!  what, might i ask, is the deal?  why are all of these characters cookie cutter dipshits?  really, is there something i am missing.  i know both the gaming and comic industries are mostly aimed at young males, but don't those young males find it a little boring and insulting that the creators of these various products think they can toss a gravity defying rack on the body of a 13 year old girl and you'll run right out and buy it?!?  i for one would rather see women in games that have real CHARACTER, not just the same barbi face, body and boobs with different color hair and skin tight outfit.  i would love to see a story (comic, game,movie...whatever) with a female lead that truly kicked ass.  now Zena's gettin' close, and sharon stone in The Quick an the Dead had potential (although she screwed it up), but as of yet i haven't seen one lean, mean, crazy in the head action oriented ass kicker character that also happens to have breasts.  i wanna see a chick who really knows how to use the guns she totes around, doesn't do her martial arts moves in stilleto heels, and snickers with glee as she blows your friggin' head off.   if anybody else wants to see this in a game, drop me line, or just wait for blood2...he he he\n\nps. don't worry all you caleb fans, you'll still get to play your favorite trenchcoat wearin' shotgun freak...\n \n\n\n7/29/97\n\n\nright now i am working about 3/4's of the time on blood two and the rest i get to \"consult\" on stuff that i did for riot...mostly weapons.  ahhh weapons.  for blood 2 i am doing the concept design for the main characters and weapons...ahhh weapons.  now frankly i am dubious wether or not anyone outside of the company is actually going to read this, but if someone does happen to give a shit (or just accidentally clicks on my name) i was hoping i could ask all of you out there in the gaming world a question...would you all be interested in seeing some the concept art for Blood 2?  i was considering whipping together some assy little web page where i would ocassionally post whatever art the powers that be would let me...you know, guns, characters, ponies, porno...whatever i had laying around.  whataya think?\n\nif you would like to tell me what you think about my crazy little idea you can email me at: ekohler@lith.com  i'd be overcome with sweat to get some responses.\n\nbe well, eric \n"}, {"by": "engin@wardsix.com", "time": 966372840, "contents": "User:   engin\nRead:   0\nUnread: 2\nTime:   Tue, 15 Aug 2000 15:54:14 -0700\nPlan:\nNow how come I've never thought of this before?\n\nThe re-thinking of the engine has started, as it happens with most projects.

I had never heard of it before one of the guys here had me check it out. I've been pretty addicted to this game for the past few weeks. While I wouldn't quite call it a flight sim, nor a shooter, nor an arcade game it has a pleasant mixture of all three. WW2 toy model fighter planes, giant sized environments, blowing stuff up, collecting powerups, getting in dogfights. What more can you ask for?\n\nIf you have something like a Logitech Wingman Gamepad I highly recommend this game. Very arcadey feel to it. Why isn't this game on consoles?

UNLESS YOUR\nJOB IS READING PLAN FILES!!\n\n\n\n\n<<------------plan Old------------->>\nOk so there is this great contest out there to see whom can make the best Low Poly model\nof a hot little slut. I think it\u00c2\u0092s a good idea and it should be interesting to see what people can\ncome up with. Time to walk the walk instead of just mouthing off all this talk.  But I have \none big problem with said contest.  I guess if you are enough of a \u00c2\u0093bad ass\u00c2\u0094 to pass into the\n2nd round then you get to animate and skin your creation.  But it says motion capture \nIs allowed, what\u00c2\u0092s up with this?  I could get a one legged bag of sand to animate with motion \nCapture.  It\u00c2\u0092s like having a contest to see who can create the most photo realistic texture and then\nallowing people to scan in photos.  At that point where is the talent required?  I know Murphy can\nanimate well, and I would be interested to see what other people could do.  But I guess some people\nare scared for some reason, I don\u00c2\u0092t know.  I just think it is kind of shitty that is all, mean animate\nyour own stuff mankle.  Plus I don\u00c2\u0092t really like the way Motion Captured animation looks on a \nlow poly model anyway, it\u00c2\u0092s creepy.  I feel the animation style needs to fit the character being \nanimated.  If you have high poly photoreal characters, like Final Fantasy does, then motion capture\nlooks bad ass.  But if you have low poly shit with motion capture animation, it looks like that EA\nsports commercials with a low poly Barry Sanders running around in the real world.  It just doesn\u00c2\u0092t\nfit, you have realistic motion on an unrealistic character running around in a most unrealistic world.\n\nSo animate your own stuff.  Or who cares what your model looks like, your animation skills are\npart of your bad assedness, so get animating you slaps.   hehe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<<------------plan Old------------->>\nSHIELDS at 2%\n\n\n\n\n<<------------plan Old------------->>\nWhen I say 3rd person games sometimes\nsuck, I am talking about Metal Gear \nSolid, and Resident Evil.

I call it the 'tag fixer' because the tag, used by Quake III to\nattach the head to the upper body and the upper body to the legs is \nresponsible for the trouble in the first place.  The component plugs directly \ninto the CHIMAERA animation system that both SOF and Trek are using and also \ninto the CHIMAERA hybrid systems for Voyager's creatures. \n\nIf you like the animations in SOF and TREK, just wait until you catch a glimpse \nof our future projects.  I'll be creating a brand new animation system by the \nname of ZEUS that, when coupled with features of the next generation GHOUL, is \ngoing to blow you away.\n\n<--Turmanator-->\n\n********************************************************************************\n10-18-99\n\nJarrod and I are taking the next couple of weeks to go over the animations with \na fine tooth comb, making them look as good as possible. This is no small task\nsince we have around 500 character animations...and only around 200 of them\nhave motion capture as their primary source. We're also taking time to make some\nspecial Death-Match-Only animations. If we have time, we could even hand animate\na few more deaths as well, but that would be relatively trivial ;). So its\npretty much spit and polish & tweaking at this point.\n\n<--Turmanator-->\n\n********************************************************************************\n\n06-07-99\n\nIt seems that there are people who are confused as to what the CHIMAERA (British\nspelling) really is. I have seen at least one web site that credits CHIMAERA for\nwhat GHOUL is responsible for. When we decided to name it, we were only trying\nto help define what the animators contributions to the project(s) were. Because\nGHOUL was getting credit for the animators hard work. Now the reverse is\nhappening. Let me clarify a little.\n\nThe tools that the animators use are mostly separate from other aspects of the\ngame. This collection of tools that the animators use to alter motion capture\ndata and make hand animated sequences is called CHIMAREA. These tools were\nbuilt entirely in Softimage|3D and have nothing to do with other packages. They\nare mostly contained in a Control Hierarchy...hence the First two letters in\nthe name CHIMAERA. CHIMAERA isn't a new modeling system nor does it replace\nGHOUL. Instead data generated by animators using CHIMAERA is received by GHOUL\nfor processing into the game...it works with GHOUL.\n\nThe character models are also constructed in Softimage|3D in compliance with\nGHOUL standards and attatched to the CHIMAERA system for animation. Not that\nGHOUL doesn't have anything to do with animation...rather, GHOUL facilitates the\nuse of the CHIMAERA animation data in the game.\n\nI hope this clears things up a bit.\n<--Turmanator-->\n\n********************************************************************************\n06-03-99\n\n   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \n   !

Then all the animators (Rob Gee, Jarrod\nShowers, Brian Shubat, Joe Sibilski, and myself...in alphabetical order) met and\ntallied them on to one list and debated over the top three.

GHOUL does\nsupport the Softimage .XSI file for importing our animations into GHOUL and I\ndidn\u00c2\u0092t get a chance to mention the fact that GHOUL also resides in the game\ncode (not just in host package for the processing part).\n\nI was recently watching the DVD version of ANTZ while listening to the\nalternate sound track of the two directors discussing the making of the movie.\nEvery time that there was a scene that required physical contact between\ndifferent characters, the directors would comment on how difficult a scene like\nthat is to animate because its easy to accidentally *push* a hand through the\nbody of the other character. When I saw that I thought, \"Wow, they are having\ntrouble with that, and we\u00c2\u0092ve easily eliminated that problem with new null\nhierarchy techniques and modifications.\"\n\nThe Null Hierarchy is being used in its current form for Star Trek Voyager\u00c2\u0092s\nbipedal creatures. So they have access to SoF\u00c2\u0092s entire animation library.\nThere are a few improvements that I\u00c2\u0092d like to make to the animation control\nsystem (Null Hierarchy) when things slow down a little, but they will have to\nwait until such a time presents itself.\n\n***** A T T E N T I O N !

And Joe\nSibilski, has had to come aboard and literally learn not only a new animation\nsystem, but a whole new software package by the seat of his pants, and he\u00c2\u0092s\nchurning out the moves as well. And I have spent a lot of time and energy\nmaking certain that it would all work by creating a new type of control system\nfor the animators (a null hierarchy). Null hierarchies aren\u00c2\u0092t anything new,\nbut the features that I\u00c2\u0092ve incorporated into this one are.\nMore on that another time...\n\nAll of the character modeling and animation was done in Softimage|3D, which\nGHOUL currently does not support, and then piped into another package, that\nhosts GHOUL, for processing into the game.\n\nI\u00c2\u0092ve seen a lot of misconceptions about the animation system being posted on\nthe net. Not to undermine the significance of GHOUL, but there is a lot of\nmisunderstanding about what it is and isn\u00c2\u0092t responsible for. Yes, GHOUL is an\namazing system that gives us a lot of possibilities, and yes we did use motion\ncapture.  But GHOUL is NOT responsible for the look of the ANIMATIONS. GHOUL's\nfeatures include, but are not limited to:\n\nModel render system\nModel lighting system\nSpecial effects\nSkinning tools\nControl over part visibility\nBolting separate models together\nEtc...\n\nNor was motion capture the sole reason the animations look the way that they do.\nGranted, the motion data that hOuse of mOves delivered to us was excellent. But\nwith animations having to mesh as seamlessly as possible with several each other,\nnot to mention motions that don\u00c2\u0092t look like they are really interacting with\ntheir environment, there\u00c2\u0092s a lot more than just taking mocap and *plopping* it\non to a character.  Then again, if it were easy, our animation would look like\neveryone else\u00c2\u0092s. ;)\n\n-->Turmanator\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\n"}, {"by": "fredn@idsoftware.com", "time": 1056982320, "contents": "Welcome to id Software's Finger Service V1.5!\n\nName: Fred Nilsson\nEmail: \nDescription: Animator\nProject: \nLast Updated: 06/30/2003 10:48:33 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJune 29th 2003\n\nIt's been a long time since I've updated this thing.\nI just wanted to give you guys 2 things I/we've had laying around for a while.\n\nIf some of you web-sites could put up mirrors.. that would be cool..\n\nFirst off, a new pro- map.    pro-q3tourney7.\n\nIt was a map I found in our old Quake3 archives, but was cut for one reason or another.\nIt had been started it long ago, but never finished it..

Bear with me...it's Wednesday and it already a weird week.\n\nFirst off, the bad news...what the hell is it with lack of respect for other's property?!?  Yes, I'm another\nvictim of the IonCar Curse.  Some low/no life punk broke into my car, taking my entire center console (including\nthe stereo), busting my window, screwing up my airbag controls and my driver's side tires.  I'm not gonna bitch\nand moan too much, cause we're aparently all targets nowadays, but I just don't get it.  Plus, if you're gonna\nsteal shit outta my car, at least do it right!!!  Take the Rollerblades and sunglasses!  Please, search the ENTIRE F*#&$%' car.  The only thing worse than a criminal is a lazy ass criminal.  Show some initiative, for God's\nsake...\n\nNext, the cool news...I got to meet Sarah Mclachlan!  Anyone who knows me knows how much I love this woman's music.\nSome have even gone so far to say that I'm obsessed.  But I'm not!!! Really.  Well, not too obsessed :)\nMy roommate won a contest.  I got to go, as a guest.  Free lunch at The Dark Room, a free mini-concert by Sarah, a picture WITH Sarah (of me with perma-grin), and a free autographed copy of her new album.  A cool score, especially considering the week I've had.  Yeah, so...I'm obsessed...\n\nNow for work stuff...\n\nEveryone on Team Doppelganger (yes...even the programmers, too ;) ), has kicked ass meeting our deadline.  Patrick, Jay-Dub, and Matt have kicked ass on terrain, Rob, Hugh, and Jay have dominated on monsters (about 30   characters/creatures processed, textured, and walk-cycled in about a month!), Chris has kicked on weapons and armor, and Paul has pumped out some cool new concepts that really give the game a new atmosphere and the end result is a VERY unique looking title, even at this early stage.  Now that just about all of our technical hurdles of been broken, our progress is moving ahead nicely.  Too bad, though.  You won't get an excessive amount of hype (read: pictures) out of us until a little later in the game.  You'll like it, though.  You just have to wait for it...\n\nGame of the Week:\n\nCastlevania: Symphony of the Night for the PSX.\n\nThis game rocks.  Beautiful graphics, great music, another classic Konami game.  A lot like Metroid / Super Metroid / Blaster Master, gameplay wise.  But with the cool trappings of a Castlevania game.  I've beaten it already, but the number of secrets hiding in it has got me coming back for more.\n\n\n\t\tG...\n\nGaijin Artist\n\nPronunciation: 'gI-(\")jEn, -(\")jin\nFunction: noun\nInflected Form(s): plural gaijin\nEtymology: Japanese, from gai- outer, foreign + -jin person\nDate: 1964\n: a foreigner in Japan\n\nLead Artist\t\t\t\t\tTeam Doppelganger\n\n\"Take my advice, or I\u00c2\u0092ll spank you without pants!\"\n\n(File last updated on Wed 08 Oct 1997 at 16:12)"}, {"by": "gateway@nihilistic.com", "time": 926970120, "contents": "Nihilistic Software\nwww.nihilistic.com\n\nUser Name.........gateway\nFull Name.........Steve Tietze\nDescription.......Director of World Design\nHome Directory....\\\\void\\users\\gateway\nLast NT Logon.....Monday, May 17, 1999 at 10:56\n\n5/17\n\nI Just got back from E3.

What's that?\n\nWell, I managed to find it again, but I'm not here to write a major update.  I'm here mostly to point any interested parties to the article I just posted on the WoT.com site: the Story Behind WoT.  It gives my perspective on the events leading up to the development of the game, and I think it's an interesting read.  Check it out at http://www.wheeloftime.com/story/main.html and let me know what you think at gdahlgren@legendent.com.\n\nThought for the day: Stay tuned.  I'm bound to have some thoughts to post here sometime soon.\n\nJune 21  23:00\n====\nTime for my periodical plan update, I'm thinking.  It's not quite as regular as the Monday development update--in fact, it's not regular at all.  It seems that some event has to happen to push me into writing here.  So be it.\n\nWhat is the event this time?  Well, it hasn't quite happened yet, but it is imminent.  Sabrina, my wonderful Italian fiancee, the love of my life, arrives here Thursday afternoon.  She's not visiting this time; she's here for the long haul.  Finally.\n\nWe've been fighting for this moment ever since we met in Cancun almost two years ago (those who remember my web page update when I left on vacation, give yourself an official WoT Slap on the Back).  We've tussled with the INS.  We've tangled with the Catholic church.  And we're not quite done yet.\n\nOur plan is to get married not once, not twice, but three times (just in case the first two don't take).  The first is probably going to be a fun yet tacky affair, perhaps even in Vegas (although not by an Elvis impersonator).  We're going to do this as soon as possible so that we can file the change of status forms and get the paperwork processing for an advance parole.  \n\nYou see, under a fiancee Visa, the INS has ruled that Sabrina isn't allowed to leave the country (if she does, she's not allowed back in), and yet she has planned a wonderful ceremony for us in Italy some time in September.  If we don't get married ahead of time and apply for the advance parole, all of Sabrina's relatives will be waiting for us, drinking the wine and drawing little pictures of me on the cocktail napkins with daggers sticking into my head accompanied by captions that, thankfully, I won't be able to read.  I don't want that.\n\nSo we have to get married almost immediately so we can file our paperwork (this is making Brad, my volleyball doubles partner and best man, nervous because he doesn't have much time to throw together a bachelor party--and it takes a lot of time to bake that hollow cake).  After that, we plan to actually put together a real ceremony so that we can celebrate the event with my family and friends--and even a few of Sabrina's relatives and friends, including her parents who have yet to ever set foot on a plane.  Then we're off to Milan, Italy to do it all again (only in Italian, I presume--I'm praying for subtitles).  \n\nNow comes the time for some idle musings about the whole situation:  You know, this whole thing is kind of like inching into icy water.  Although jumping into the lake would get it over with, I'm hoping that by the time I'm in Italy, I'll be used to the whole thing. :)  Maybe I should promote the event and sell a package deal ticket for all three ceremonies: \"Around the World in Three Weddings\" or \"The World Series of Weddings\" or \"Three Weddings and No Funeral\" (I forgot how bad my jokes can be sometimes).  I wonder if I can swing three times the wedding present loot?  And finally, can you imagine being forced to watch all three wedding videos?  (Maybe I'll eventually use them as a punishment for our children).  \n\nThere's another event coming up shortly.  Raise your hands if you remember my plan update about buying a hole in the ground.  Is your hand up?  Really?  Did you actually give yourself the WoT Slap on the Back too?  OK... now everyone who remembers Monday's development update, go ahead and poke yourself in the eye.  I know it hurt--sorry.   I just wanted to see what else I could get you to do.  (You'd better stop reading.  Sooner or later, this power I've got will corrupt and I'll have you punching perfect strangers and sending your paycheck directly to me.)\n\nAnyway, the house we planned to have one day is almost done.   Someday soon, perhaps I'll post a picture or two of it.  My childhood has hardwired me with the desire for a large house with a reasonably sized lawn to raise my own family.  Sabrina and I both discovered a wonderful model and then managed to find a lot that fulfilled my wishes.  Now that it's almost finished, I find myself falling more and more in love with it.  It's the house that I've dreamed of, and the fact that Sabrina is as much in love with it as I just makes it perfect.  We both love the neighborhood as well.  We plan to move there in about two weeks.  Any volunteers to help?\n\nBecause of the upcoming move, I recently sent out an email that notified some family and friends to our upcoming address and phone number.  The names at the top were Glen and Sabrina Dahlgren.  When Sabrina received it, she reacted much like I did when I typed it.  It seems so straightforward, but even a little thing like this helps the reality of it come home.  After so long, we're actually going to be together.  We're actually going to be married.  We're going to spend the rest of our lives together.\n\nThis is so right.\n\nThought for the day:  Those of you who remember that I end my updates with a thought for the day, go ahead and sucker punch your neighbor and send your paycheck on over to my new address!  (I warned you.)\n\n\nMay 17  20:28\n====\nE3 went really well.  Everyone worked very hard up until we left, and then worked like crazy on the show floor.  It all came together and kicked ass.  I'm not in the office (I and the rest of the team are recovering today), so I'm postponing the update to decribe it all until tomorrow.\n\nUntil then!\n\nMarch 21  23:57\n====\nIt's been quite a while since my last update, but if you're reading this, I guess you know that.  As you probably also know, most of my game-related stuff goes into my weekly updates to wot.com, so don't expect any Wheel of Time insights here.\n\nMostly, I wanted to respond to the surprising number of emails asking about Sabrina, the new house, and all of the other boring elements of my life that most people should have zero interest in.\n\nFirst, Sabrina is doing wonderfully.  A few weeks ago, she had her gall bladder removed in an Italian hospital.  I was lucky enough to be there to care for her the little bit I could during the operation and a few hours afterward, but then I had to fly back to help with WoT, so I had to wish her well over the phone from then on.  It was a little strange to actually see the stone they removed from her.  It was about the size and texture of a peach pit.  I'm sure that it'll make an interesting conversation piece eventually.\n\nShe was laid up for a week or so, but is now on her feet and back to work.  The operation was a complete success.  She's actually going back for wedding dress fittings and the like, so things are pretty much back to normal.\n\nSpeaking of the upcoming wedding, this is another front in our lives right now.  It seems that two institutions hold quite a bit of power over our future right now--institutions that I never thought I'd be tangling with: the INS and the Catholic Church.\n\nBased on the requirements that the Powers That Be have leveled, we've tentatively set some dates for the various ceremonies and we're now scrambling for paperwork.  First, she'll come here to help me move into the new house shortly after we've shipped WoT (and I've collapsed--along with the rest of the team, I'm sure).  After a few months (90 days, to be exact), we'll get married here.  I'm not quite sure what the ceremony will entail, but I suspect it may simply be civil--because after we go on a honeymoon for a week or so, we'll fly to Italy for a religious ceremony, hopefully in one of the many huge, ancient, and beautiful churches there.  \n\nThe Catholic church has been very much like a large stone, not really going out of their way to stop us, but certainly not making our trip any easier.  My mother is rummaging around, looking for my baptism certificate, writing up a declaration that I'm free to marry.  I'm trying to find a local priest that can take us through the training (training to be married; what'll those wacky Catholics come up with next?).  The Canonical Prenuptial Investigation is especially... interesting.\n\nHere are a few sample questions:\n\n1) Marriage is by its nature directed toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and raising of children.  Do you accept the duty of fatherhood without excluding the good of procreation?\n\n2) During the engagement did you have any reasons to doubt about the success of your marriage?  Did you hide anything that could upset seriously the married life (for example: serious mental illness...)?\n\n3) Are there any other impediments to the canonical marriage (id est: have you received Holy Orders or made perpetual religious profession?  Have you raped your fiancee?  Were you in any way responsible for the death of your previous spouse?  Are you aware of any bodily defect that would prevent you from having marital relations?).\n\nAnd there's more...\n\nBut we're forging ahead.  And all of this on top of the machine that is WoT.\n\nPersonally, I have a vision that keeps me going.  It's like this: \n\n1) We've released WoT, and people like it (even the die hard fans).\n2) Sabrina and I are happily married.\n3) We're living in our new house (with BA wiring and the most expensive bidet in the world).\n4) She's found a wonderful job that makes her happy, but doesn't keep her away from me any more than my job does from her.\n5) After a period of recuperation--and cool down for everyone involved--I work with the wonderful and talented team at Legend (anyone I can pry away from Unreal 2, at least) to make WoT 2 (or something much like it) to produce many of the elements that we didn't get to in WoT 1.\n\nUntil then, we'll all keep going on WoT.  The end is in sight, but sprinting the last few miles is hard for anyone, especially after running a marathon.  I can't tell you how proud I am of this team.  And, as wonderful as the end product will be, I'm convinced that it will merely show the seeds of what we're all capable of.  \n\nLegend's just getting warmed up.\n\nThought for the day: \"If you're responsible for the death of your previous spouse, perhaps a church wedding is not for you.\"\n\n\nDecember 19  19:32\n====\nLast night, I got the Christmas present that I was praying for: a letter from the INS informing me that my petition to bring Sabrina to the U.S. had been approved.  Our trials aren't over; the petition has been cabled to the consolate in Naples.  They're going to send her the appropriate forms, and then she'll have to go there for an interview.  But the assumed time for this process is about two months.  My guess is that she'll be here to see the release of WoT, and that we'll be married shortly thereafter (just in time to go on a honeymoon!).  \n\nBTW, make sure to check out the disk that comes with the latest Next Gen (I finally picked up a copy this evening).  It has a really cool trailer for the game.  You can finally see something move (although the effects are really outdated)!\n\nThought for the day: Have a fan-freakin-tastic Xmas!\n\n\nDecember 12  01:08\n====\nMy my my.  It's been a while since I had a moment to breathe, much less update my .plan.  Honestly, the weekly update to the web page is more than I usually have time for, so my .plan is usually relegated into the ether.  But, I had a moment, we just delivered an important milestone, so I decided to write.\n\nQuite a lot has happened in my life since last I visited my .plan.  First, I finally sold my house.  I took a bath on it and financed a second trust, but twenty-year-old townhouses aren't easy to unload in this area.  I was happy to get out alive.\n\nShortly thereafter, I moved into an apartment that I haven't seen very much of.  I like it a lot--although I was convinced that there was no way that the movers could fit all of my stuff into this two bedroom space.  They did.  Of course, the boxes are about half the size that they once were.  I'm sure that there was a lot of air in those packages, though.\n\nI'm leaving most of it boxed since I'll be moving out in a few months into my new house--the one I haven't even looked at.  According to my contract, they're building it, but I haven't had a chance to drive by to confirm it.  I might be moving into a hole in the ground.  I wonder how the movers will fit my stuff in *there*?\n\nSabrina is back in Italy right now.  Last year, I had planned to travel to Italy to spend Xmas with her and her family, and New Year's and her Birthday (which are both the same day, by the way) with her in the most romantic hotel in Venice.  Well, the game calls, and I must heed it.  Instead, I'm flying her out here for a few days surrounding Jan. 1st so I can spend it with her.  I'll spend Xmas with my close companion, WoT.\n\nActually, I'm just happy that I'm going to get to see Sabrina; I just wish I knew exactly when she was coming here for good.  I would really like her in my life.  We're both working tirelessly to get her fiancee visa out of the INS.  \n\nThey haven't made things particularly easy for us.  I ordered the forms from them, and they sent them.  The day I received the forms, I sent them back filled out with all of the requested supporting documents.  Unfortunately, from the time that they sent me the forms to the time that I received them, the application fee was raised.  So they returned everything, telling me that they wanted more money.  They wasted more than two weeks with this process.  Arrgh.\n\nI wrote another check and resubmitted the forms.  Another two weeks go by, and I received both a notice that they've started processing the application, and a request for documented proof that Sabrina and I have actually met.  It may not sound like much, but in the midst of crunch-time, it was really difficult finding time to gather and organize all of the documentation to prove that Sabrina and I were in the same place at the same time.  Sabrina helped a lot.  She managed to keep plane tickets, photos, statements from her checking account from when she lived with me, etc.  I placed this, along with a bunch of stuff I had, in a package with a written account of our history together.  Now, I'm waiting for the next chapter in the INS story.\n\nWe're hoping that she can interview with the embassy in Italy within a month or two.  After that, she'll move here in about two months.  Then the visa states that we have to get married within three months of her arrival.  \n\nWe considered getting married three times total--the first in Las Vegas, to satisfy the INS requirement.  Then, we'd have a ceremony in the US for my family and friends.  Finally, we'd have another in Italy for her friends and considerable family--also to make it legal; marriages in either country are not recognized by the other.  But this means I'll actually be an Italian citizen.  Cool.\n\nWe're still debating whether we should go for the Las Vegas trip.  I have a friend who arranged his wonderful wedding within about three months, so I know it's actually possible.  Also, Sabrina won't have a job when she first arrives--she'll still be interviewing--so it may be that she can handle most of the arrangements.  Lord knows I'm not going to be able to soon.\n\nWe've been discussing the wedding in Italy.  Boy, those Italian Catholics are strict!  They want us to go through big, metal, barbed hoops just to get married in a church there (I'll just start with the six month's required marriage \"training\", and let your imagination take it from there).  \n\nI'm not quite sure what we're going to do, but I know her family is VERY excited about having a big wedding/party there.  And, to my amazement, my parents actually want to attend the Italian ceremony as well.  Given that English is virtually my sole form of communication, it'll be nice to be able to speak to someone other than my wife-to-be (I envision the Italian priest asking me to agree to all sorts of bizarre vows, and I'm just nodding my head like an imbecile and saying \"I do, I do\" to everything while the onlookers roll on the floor laughing).\n\nI think that's enough for one chunk.  I'll try to update more frequently, but I promise nothing.  WoT is nothing if not a jealous mistress.  Wait a second, WoT's a GAME, not a jealous mistress.  Does that mean it's nothing?  Wow, I'm tired.\n\nI'll leave you with my thought of the day.  It's not exactly a quotable thought, but it's been running through my head lately.  \n\nLife is a series of experiences.  As you get older, time passes faster.  Well, it doesn't really, but it feels that way.  This is because, as your repertoire of experiences grows, you are no longer forced to process how to deal with them from scratch.  Dealing with new experiences makes you aware of the time you take to do it.  When life is slipping away, chances are that you're in a rut.  Believe me, sometimes the most comfortable place is to lie there in that rut.\n\nIf you want to truly live, get out of it.  Do something new.  Find a wonderful Italian girl and marry her (well, it's working for me).  Life is always what you make of it.  When you think of how long you've been alive, realize that this number of years is ETERNITY to you.  NOTHING existed before you were born, at least, as far as you're concerned.  Chances are, you have more than eternity ahead of you as well.  As long as you live it.\n\nSo, if you think I'm crazy, then just chock it up to my tiredness.  If you get something out of it, well, I'm still tired, so it's probably just you.\n\nLater!\n\n\nOctober 2  11:15\n====\nI apologize for skipping the Monday update; this has been a rough week all over.  There's no way I'm going to get to do the update before next Monday, so this will have to do.  \n\nThe presentation for the magazine feature went really well (although every time I mention the word DEMO in an update, I get a million requests for it--let me tell you now that when we build a public demo, you'll KNOW about it! I'll do everything possible to get it into your hands, not hoard it, waiting for people to pry it out of mine).  \n\nWe've also been playing some arena matches lately, which rock.  The whole game has a much different rhythm than any other FPS out there.  It's pretty cool.\n\nYou'd think that with Sabrina in Italy, my life would have a little extra time built in.  Nope.  The game is very demanding right now, supplemented by selling my house, finding an apartment, buying the new house, and moving (twice, eventually).  Also, the paperwork associated with getting Sabrina here is a pain in the ass (an expression Sabrina finds hilarious because she visualizes it literally; I guess there is no Italian equivalent).\n\nI think that's enough for now.  Hey, it's only a few days until the next update anyway.\n\nThought for the day: \"I'm in the Black Cherry Zone.\"\n\t--Quote from Scott and I working on the magazine presentation that we found incredibly funny at about 4:00am.\n\n\nSeptember 21  18:22\n====\nWell, I've gone and done it.  I bought a house.  Actually, I paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for a big pile of dirt, rocks, and weeds (which is MUCH better, don't you think?).  I guess you could consider all that money as a bet that a house WILL be there when I need it.  \n\nSabrina and I must have looked at every dang house from here to the city (Washington).  We met every type of person in our travels including someone that ordered us off the property and refused to believe that the house that he was renting was for sale, despite the fact that I had the advertisement with a BIG photo of the house to show him (he didn't appreciate my showing it to him, either).

Everyone worked very hard up until we left, and then worked like crazy on the show floor.  It all came together and kicked ass.  I'm not in the office (I and the rest of the team are recovering today), so I'm postponing the update to decribe it all until tomorrow.\n\nUntil then!\n\nMarch 21  23:57\n====\nIt's been quite a while since my last update, but if you're reading this, I guess you know that.  As you probably also know, most of my game-related stuff goes into my weekly updates to wot.com, so don't expect any Wheel of Time insights here.\n\nMostly, I wanted to respond to the surprising number of emails asking about Sabrina, the new house, and all of the other boring elements of my life that most people should have zero interest in.\n\nFirst, Sabrina is doing wonderfully.  A few weeks ago, she had her gall bladder removed in an Italian hospital.  I was lucky enough to be there to care for her the little bit I could during the operation and a few hours afterward, but then I had to fly back to help with WoT, so I had to wish her well over the phone from then on.  It was a little strange to actually see the stone they removed from her.  It was about the size and texture of a peach pit.  I'm sure that it'll make an interesting conversation piece eventually.\n\nShe was laid up for a week or so, but is now on her feet and back to work.  The operation was a complete success.  She's actually going back for wedding dress fittings and the like, so things are pretty much back to normal.\n\nSpeaking of the upcoming wedding, this is another front in our lives right now.  It seems that two institutions hold quite a bit of power over our future right now--institutions that I never thought I'd be tangling with: the INS and the Catholic Church.\n\nBased on the requirements that the Powers That Be have leveled, we've tentatively set some dates for the various ceremonies and we're now scrambling for paperwork.  First, she'll come here to help me move into the new house shortly after we've shipped WoT (and I've collapsed--along with the rest of the team, I'm sure).  After a few months (90 days, to be exact), we'll get married here.  I'm not quite sure what the ceremony will entail, but I suspect it may simply be civil--because after we go on a honeymoon for a week or so, we'll fly to Italy for a religious ceremony, hopefully in one of the many huge, ancient, and beautiful churches there.  \n\nThe Catholic church has been very much like a large stone, not really going out of their way to stop us, but certainly not making our trip any easier.  My mother is rummaging around, looking for my baptism certificate, writing up a declaration that I'm free to marry.  I'm trying to find a local priest that can take us through the training (training to be married; what'll those wacky Catholics come up with next?).  The Canonical Prenuptial Investigation is especially... interesting.\n\nHere are a few sample questions:\n\n1) Marriage is by its nature directed toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and raising of children.  Do you accept the duty of fatherhood without excluding the good of procreation?\n\n2) During the engagement did you have any reasons to doubt about the success of your marriage?  Did you hide anything that could upset seriously the married life (for example: serious mental illness...)?\n\n3) Are there any other impediments to the canonical marriage (id est: have you received Holy Orders or made perpetual religious profession?  Have you raped your fiancee?  Were you in any way responsible for the death of your previous spouse?  Are you aware of any bodily defect that would prevent you from having marital relations?).\n\nAnd there's more...\n\nBut we're forging ahead.  And all of this on top of the machine that is WoT.\n\nPersonally, I have a vision that keeps me going.  It's like this: \n\n1) We've released WoT, and people like it (even the die hard fans).\n2) Sabrina and I are happily married.\n3) We're living in our new house (with BA wiring and the most expensive bidet in the world).\n4) She's found a wonderful job that makes her happy, but doesn't keep her away from me any more than my job does from her.\n5) After a period of recuperation--and cool down for everyone involved--I work with the wonderful and talented team at Legend (anyone I can pry away from Unreal 2, at least) to make WoT 2 (or something much like it) to produce many of the elements that we didn't get to in WoT 1.\n\nUntil then, we'll all keep going on WoT.  The end is in sight, but sprinting the last few miles is hard for anyone, especially after running a marathon.  I can't tell you how proud I am of this team.  And, as wonderful as the end product will be, I'm convinced that it will merely show the seeds of what we're all capable of.  \n\nLegend's just getting warmed up.\n\nThought for the day: \"If you're responsible for the death of your previous spouse, perhaps a church wedding is not for you.\"\n\n\nDecember 19  19:32\n====\nLast night, I got the Christmas present that I was praying for: a letter from the INS informing me that my petition to bring Sabrina to the U.S. had been approved.  Our trials aren't over; the petition has been cabled to the consolate in Naples.  They're going to send her the appropriate forms, and then she'll have to go there for an interview.  But the assumed time for this process is about two months.  My guess is that she'll be here to see the release of WoT, and that we'll be married shortly thereafter (just in time to go on a honeymoon!).  \n\nBTW, make sure to check out the disk that comes with the latest Next Gen (I finally picked up a copy this evening).  It has a really cool trailer for the game.  You can finally see something move (although the effects are really outdated)!\n\nThought for the day: Have a fan-freakin-tastic Xmas!\n\n\nDecember 12  01:08\n====\nMy my my.  It's been a while since I had a moment to breathe, much less update my .plan.  Honestly, the weekly update to the web page is more than I usually have time for, so my .plan is usually relegated into the ether.  But, I had a moment, we just delivered an important milestone, so I decided to write.\n\nQuite a lot has happened in my life since last I visited my .plan.  First, I finally sold my house.  I took a bath on it and financed a second trust, but twenty-year-old townhouses aren't easy to unload in this area.  I was happy to get out alive.\n\nShortly thereafter, I moved into an apartment that I haven't seen very much of.  I like it a lot--although I was convinced that there was no way that the movers could fit all of my stuff into this two bedroom space.  They did.  Of course, the boxes are about half the size that they once were.  I'm sure that there was a lot of air in those packages, though.\n\nI'm leaving most of it boxed since I'll be moving out in a few months into my new house--the one I haven't even looked at.  According to my contract, they're building it, but I haven't had a chance to drive by to confirm it.  I might be moving into a hole in the ground.  I wonder how the movers will fit my stuff in *there*?\n\nSabrina is back in Italy right now.  Last year, I had planned to travel to Italy to spend Xmas with her and her family, and New Year's and her Birthday (which are both the same day, by the way) with her in the most romantic hotel in Venice.  Well, the game calls, and I must heed it.  Instead, I'm flying her out here for a few days surrounding Jan. 1st so I can spend it with her.  I'll spend Xmas with my close companion, WoT.\n\nActually, I'm just happy that I'm going to get to see Sabrina; I just wish I knew exactly when she was coming here for good.  I would really like her in my life.  We're both working tirelessly to get her fiancee visa out of the INS.  \n\nThey haven't made things particularly easy for us.  I ordered the forms from them, and they sent them.  The day I received the forms, I sent them back filled out with all of the requested supporting documents.  Unfortunately, from the time that they sent me the forms to the time that I received them, the application fee was raised.  So they returned everything, telling me that they wanted more money.  They wasted more than two weeks with this process.  Arrgh.\n\nI wrote another check and resubmitted the forms.  Another two weeks go by, and I received both a notice that they've started processing the application, and a request for documented proof that Sabrina and I have actually met.  It may not sound like much, but in the midst of crunch-time, it was really difficult finding time to gather and organize all of the documentation to prove that Sabrina and I were in the same place at the same time.  Sabrina helped a lot.  She managed to keep plane tickets, photos, statements from her checking account from when she lived with me, etc.  I placed this, along with a bunch of stuff I had, in a package with a written account of our history together.  Now, I'm waiting for the next chapter in the INS story.\n\nWe're hoping that she can interview with the embassy in Italy within a month or two.  After that, she'll move here in about two months.  Then the visa states that we have to get married within three months of her arrival.  \n\nWe considered getting married three times total--the first in Las Vegas, to satisfy the INS requirement.  Then, we'd have a ceremony in the US for my family and friends.  Finally, we'd have another in Italy for her friends and considerable family--also to make it legal; marriages in either country are not recognized by the other.  But this means I'll actually be an Italian citizen.  Cool.\n\nWe're still debating whether we should go for the Las Vegas trip.  I have a friend who arranged his wonderful wedding within about three months, so I know it's actually possible.  Also, Sabrina won't have a job when she first arrives--she'll still be interviewing--so it may be that she can handle most of the arrangements.  Lord knows I'm not going to be able to soon.\n\nWe've been discussing the wedding in Italy.  Boy, those Italian Catholics are strict!

I bought a house.  Actually, I paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for a big pile of dirt, rocks, and weeds (which is MUCH better, don't you think?).  I guess you could consider all that money as a bet that a house WILL be there when I need it.  \n\nSabrina and I must have looked at every dang house from here to the city (Washington).  We met every type of person in our travels including someone that ordered us off the property and refused to believe that the house that he was renting was for sale, despite the fact that I had the advertisement with a BIG photo of the house to show him (he didn't appreciate my showing it to him, either).  I was sincerely scared that he was about to go postal on us, even with his whole family there.  We also discovered that model homes are great places to get cold drinks; we stopped inside of a $450,000 house, nodded appreciatively, and grabbed a couple of sodas from the refrigerator before high-tailing to much cheaper lands.\n\nOne thing you should know about northern VA: the closer you get to D.C., the more money you throw away--or the crappier the houses are in your price range.  We visited one \"contemporary\" house (which is a term realtors give houses that they just can't figure out) in Fairfax that I swear was designed by a madman.  The description stated that there were five levels and three bedrooms.  We concluded that it must have been a misprint.  It wasn't.  \n\nThis house was some abstract artist's nightmare; there were levels there without ANY rooms.  Blind corridors, catwalks, crawlways, a bedroom with a bathtub in the corner, stairs leading into pits, and rooms secluded from everything (the chains and manacles had been removed, of course).  The exterior was even worse; the neighbor planted a row of trees just to block out the view.  I was convinced that the man who lived there just disappeared one day--to return only in the dead of night when someone else had moved in.  \n\nThere's no real reason for us to extend ourselves too much to buy property close to the city.  Although we have no idea where Sabrina is going to end up working, Legend is located somewhat west of D.C.--far enough so that by traveling just a bit more, you hit the edge of the housing expansion where prices are a little more reasonable and lot sizes are just a bit bigger (I managed to find a yard where I might actually be able to play volleyball).  We're buying a wonderful new house in a community that Sabrina and I adore, just off of the main route so that commuting won't be too painful.\n\nI've learned that a man without the woman of his life should absolutely steer clear of interior design decisions, though.  With Sabrina in Italy right now waiting for the fiancee visa, I'm finding that the answer to many of these questions is the same: \"I'll have to check with her.\"\n\nIncidentally, it's really tough being without Sabrina right now.  Does anyone truly know if it would impede the process of getting the fiancee visa to have her here?  (Qualified answers only, please; I can guess as well as the next guy--and with the research I've done lately, I can probably guess BETTER).  \n\nBuying this house is just the latest of a bunch of life-changing \"clicks\" that I've had lately--things that you work on, worry over, think about, etc. for a long time (I was house-hunting for almost a year), which suddenly click into place.  When you make the right decision (or to quote Bob, \"When it solves more problems than it causes\"), you know it.  It feels right.  I've had a lot of these lately, culminating literally years of worry.\n\nNow, if my current house actually sells soon (there's a contract on it already), I've got to find a place to live for the next six months.  Yuch.\n\nThought for the day: Sometimes, procrastinating is the most useful thing you can do.  \n\n\nSeptember 15  11:01\n====\nAs you may have read in wheeloftime.com's update, I've just returned from a wonderful trip to Washington State, my birthplace.  I went there mostly to show Sabrina where I grew up and to introduce her to my father--and a little something more.  A wonderful thing about visiting Washington is that you can see virtually every type of geography: ocean view, the mountains, the desert, and miles and miles of green forest.  I even took some pictures for our level designers; I saw a wonderful representation of the Mountains of Mist here.\n\nWe started in Westport, a declining resort town that nevertheless is one of the most important places in the world to me, then drove back to Seattle where we spent some quality time with my father and half-sister.  By far, though, the most important leg of the trip was the last.\n\nWe drove over the mountains and arrived in Richland, my home town.  Given that it was a plastic community created to support the research work being done in Hanford over thirty years ago, I'm continually surprised that the small town not only survives, but flourishes.  We stayed in the Doubletree hotel, which had taken over the Hanford House--a hotel I remember from my youth, a place I always wanted to visit.  It's a round building surrounding a wonderful garden courtyard right on the shore of the Columbia River.\n\nAfter having dinner in the Edgewater (the hotel restaurant which overlooks the river), we took a stroll in the park that runs along side the Columbia.  There, on a dimly lit dock, I produced a ring and told Sabrina that I wanted nothing more than to share my life with her.  Then, just in case she didn't take the hint, I asked her to marry me.  For some reason, she agreed.  \n\nI can't tell you how happy this makes me.  Sabrina is truly my partner in all things, and the thought of building a life with her makes the future very exciting.  \n\nNow, she has returned to Italy as we process the fiancee visa to bring her back.  This will undoubtedly take a few months at least.  While I'd give anything to have her back now, this does give me some time to focus on building The Wheel of Time.  It's funny but game people seem to do best when they have no other life--but it tends to work out because truly impassioned game people don't mind; they're doing what they'd do in their off time anyway.\n\nLet me reiterate that I think this is probably the best time in history to be here.  Some wonderful things are happening at Legend, and I'm really glad to be a part of it all.  We've got a great team which is going to make some great stuff.  Stay tuned; it only gets better from here.\n\nThought for the day: If you're trying to define love, you haven't found it yet.\n\n\nAugust 27  14:32\n====\nWithin the space of a week (after a lapse of years), I saw two concerts.  Talk about a study in extremes: one was Van Halen, and the other was the San Fran Ballet Company, and let me tell you, the Ballet ROCKED (but Eddie could have used a tutu)!  It's a good thing I wasn't a die-hard VH fan; I think the new singer would have ruined it for me.\n\nWhile I was at the Nissan Pavilion, I learned that Jethro Tull will be touring soon.

The sheer scale and complexity taking shape in U2 is exciting and I already have that burning urge to show our levels off to the public. Unfortunately that will have to wait for a bit longer.\n\tYou know, the worst part about making a game is that you never get the full impact of seeing it for the first time after it is complete. Every few days I drop by another level designers desk and find myself floored by what they are doing. Needless to say, there is a plethora of talent working here. \n\tMore details? I'm working on a foreboding world that resides on the fringes of known space. Let that suffice for now.\n\nThe People\n\n\tIt has been about five or six months since my first day here at Legend. During this time I have gotten to know just about everyone in the office and those who are working in other states or other countries. My exact place of work is in something we call THE CAVE_It is a dark and spacious area inhabited by 6 brilliantly demented cave dwellers who sole dietary staple is caffeine\n_oh yes we also share this space with a mangled corpse who seems to enjoy sleeping all day.\n\nThe Time From Yesterday To Tomorrow.\n\n\tI like to take a drive every few days_ usually in the evening right before the sun sets. This is the time when most of my ideas start to develop. During these drives I listen to music and head out west towards the countryside of Virginia. I have been listening to the The Fragile lately to me it is a visually descriptive album and fits in well with the untouched landscapes of the countryside.\n\tAnother means of gathering Ideas for my work I try to look at all kinds of things in the environment around me_our offices are in a somewhat industrial section of the state and as you could imagine there are all sorts of unique materials and shapes that come with industrial design. I have also been watching all of Ridley Scotts movies\n_they tend to make great use of lighting and he imbues his work with a distinctive feel of ambiance. \nOne other haunt of mine is the sprawl of Downtown Washington DC._I have always loved walking through cities_so much to see both alive and dead.\n\tAs for Games I have been playing Thief 1 and 2 over and over again. The feel of the environments are great< the sound is great\tSo for now_ I'll be up late at night working on Unreal 2_trying to imbue the game with all the thoughts from my days.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBeen working hard the last few months.

It's called:\n\n\"TALES OF THE INSIGNIFICANT\"\n\nFor the 1st installment of my new ground breaking entertainment form, \nplease re-driect yourselves over to Mike Hadwin's .plan at \nhttp://www.stomped.com/quake/finger/mph@hipnotic.com.html.  It think \nit's damn funny and entertaining.  Wish I could be that clever, but I \nseem to have too much work to do.\n\nNow, onto \"significant\" things like...\n\nShadow Warrior update (Wednesday 4/30/97 - 4:15 pm)\n===================================================\nToday is about the last content addition day we will have.  Lee got \nback from a voice session with John Galt (Lo Wang) and this should \nwrap up the voice work for the shareware version.  Hopefully by late \ntonight/early tomorrow, we will be done.  The only thing left to do \ncontent wise, is add ending screens, and the shareware ending \nsequence. This should also maybe be done tonight or tomorrow.  My \nplan is that we freeze code Fri-Sat, then start hammering for bugs \nonly.  With any luck a release will follow shortly thereafter.  The \nteam is extremely pumped up as we can smell the release and nobody \nwants to do anything but work. \n\n\n4/28/97  11:22 pm\n\nI just heard from Paul Schuytema (Prey Producer) who is attending the \nComputer Game Develoepr's Conference (CGDC), that Duke Nukem 3D won \n\"Best Action Game\" and we got another nifty trophy.  The nominees \nwere : Super Mario 64, Quake, Tomb Raider, Tekken 2, Duke Nukem 3D.  \nI'd like to thank all those who voted for us.  We really appreciate \nit.\n \nAlso spent a good part of the day doing interviews about \nDuke Nukem Forever and responding to hundreds of user emails \nsupporting us, or asking questions.  Thanks for the support and \nfeedback guys.\n\nShadow Warrior update (Sunday 4/27/97 - 10:43pm)\n================================================\nThe game is progressing very well.  We are all in wrap up mode, just\ntrying to get the code frozen so we can test the final version.  We\nthink it will be 4-5 days before we can have a chance of freezing code,\nbecause there are still some things to implement in the shareware\nversion like the boss ending, pre-caching art/sounds, some net sync bugs\nand a couple of major lock bugs.  We're having very stable net games and\ncan play for hours without problems at this point.  The shareware will\nfeature WangBang (DeathMatch), Co-Op, and Team Play (decided by color).\nAll these are 100% in and fully operational, as is most of the game.  We\nstill anticipate a shareware release within 2 weeks (putting it into\nearly May).\n\n4/27/97 - 10:49pm\nThe news is pretty nuch out that we have licensed the Quake/Quake II\nengine for the next Duke Nukem game called \"Duke Nukem Forever\".  We\nsee this as an awesome deal with awesome potential.  Mixing Duke's\ninnovative gameplay with the amazing Quake engine should yield a\nmassively fun game to play.  See our web site for press releases\npertaining to this.  Here are some general answer's to common questions\nI've been getting.\n\nQ: Why license the Quake engine and not use your own Prey engine?\nA: It is simply a buisness decsion and a matter of timing for us.  The\nPrey engine is in good shape and the project is marching along, but we\nare skipping a generation of tech with Prey and going 100% hardware\nonly.  By the time Prey comes out, the market will be there.  In the\nmeantime we wanted to make a new Duke Nukem game, and our goal is to\nhave it out in mid 1998.  The obvious choice was Quake.  It is\nproduction code that is stable and out.  id Software is 5 minutes away\nand we have a good relationship with them.  It seems like a slam dunk\ndecision.\n\nQ: Will you maintain Quake's free play on the Internet model?\nA: Yes.  Duke Nukem Forever will be on TEN, but will also be available\nacross the net in the same fashion Quake is.\n\nWe aren't discussing any more about the game at this time.  We have been\ndoing R&D and design work since December and suffice to say, we have a\nfairly solid game design plan to follow.  We know what we want to do to\npush Duke Nukem as a character and a game, and for the most part we know\nhow to do it all.  We will be posting some survey's to see what you want\nin 1) a Quake engine game and 2) a Duke Nukem game.  We will then go into\na cave for the next year and work steadily on the game.  When we emerge,\nyou should be able to play something really cool.  The official release\nfor the game is, as always \"When it's done\".\n"}, {"by": "gerald.harrison@dynamix.com", "time": 934441020, "contents": "Message of the Day:\n\nWelcome to the Dynamix Finger Server!\nbe sure to check out http://www.dynamix.com\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUser Name: gerald.harrison     Plan Last Modified: 04/12/1999 14:16:57 PST\n\n//--------------------------------------\nGerald Harrison\n\n.Plan Active \n"}, {"by": "gmarshall@humanhead.com", "time": 965782740, "contents": "Welcome to Human Head Studios' Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Greg Marshall\nEmail: gmarshall@humanhead.com\nDescription: Artist\nProject: Rune\nWeb Page: Human Head Studios' Web SiteThis plan file is the opinion of the individual who writes it and does not reflect the opinions of the Human Head Studios.\nLast Updated: 05/19/1999 21:19:16 (GMT Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"}, {"by": "goble@lith.com", "time": 915493560, "contents": "\n*** Monolith Production's Finger Server\n\nUser name: goble\nPlan modified: Mon Jan 04 17:40:00 1999\n\n1/4/99\n\nThe Gruntz web site is up!

However, it turns out\nthat marketing has some big release plans in the\nworks for the Shogo demo--so they're not going to\nrelease it until Tuesday or Wednesday (hopefully\nTuesday).  I'm not exactly sure what all is\ninvolved, so stay tuned.  I strongly suggest that\nyou pick up a copy of the full version of Shogo\nwhile you're waiting.  ;)\n\nThe Shogo 2.1 patch is out and I keep having these\ncravings to jump on a server and get some frags\n(which of course I give in to every time).  It's\nsoooo much fun!  :)\n12/9/98\n\nThe Shogo 2.1 patch update is almost ready--it's\nin final testing right now, and should be ready\nfor a release on Friday evening!  We had a big\ntest game going the other day and I was on fire!\nI was unstoppable on the on-foot levels! It was\na blast--especially since it's kinda rare for me\nto come out on top of the frag count :)\n\nThe Shogo 2.1 demo (with multiplayer!) is almost\nready to go as well.  It should be out by Monday!\n\nI added some new console variables to ShogoSrv so\npeople could specify if they are hosting servers\nrunning mods via the gamemode and gametype GameSpy\nserver info values.  Should be useful now that mods\nare starting to appear.  :)\n\nThe Blood2 multiplayer patch work has already\nstarted.  Greg already has all of the game\ncompiling under the new engine code...except for\nthe module that I am responsible for...so I better\nget back to work!  :)\n12/3/98\n\nFirst, I want to apologize for jumping the gun\non the release of the Gruntz demo.  The demo is\ndone and ready to go, but marketing has a big\nevent planned for the beginning of January and\nthe demo will be released as part of that event.\nSo, sorry to start your mouth watering and then\ntake away the juicy steak from your plate.  :)\n\nNext, I want to let you know that the new Shogo\ndemo with multiplayer is basically ready to go\n(as well as the 2.1 update for the full version)\nexcept that we are still banging our heads\ntogether (it feels so good when we stop) trying\nto figure out this high-ping problem with some\nmodems (mostly 3Com).  :|\n\nLastly, I want to let everyone know that there\nwill be a Blood2 server page (like the Shogo\nserver page) up in a week or so.  Spen is swamped\nright now and we are also busy on the multiplayer\npatch for Blood2.  It will be worth the wait tho.\n\n:)11/24/98\n\nI just gave a build of the new Shogo demo (with\nmultiplayer!) to QA for testing.  There's a few\nminor (t)issues and we are also still working on\na fix for the \"high-ping\" problem.  The new Shogo\ndemo has two multiplayer levels (one OF and one\nMCA), includes a stand-alone server, and supports\nGameSpy.  The MCA level is a good-sized one, so\nget ready for some big games.  :)\n\nWhile you're waiting for the new Shogo demo to\nbe released, be sure to buy the full version!  :)\n\nWe are also finishing up a small single-player\npatch for Blood2 that contains some minor fixes,\nfeatures and optimizations.  Rumor has it that\nsome stores already have Blood2...so we're hoping\nto have this small (but useful) patch available\nvery soon (possibly even on Wednesday).  Oh yeah,\nthis new patch also makes the game even more\nbloody.  :)\n\nWith the small single-player patch basically out\nof the way, we can now start on the big multiplayer\npatch for Blood2.  This will greatly improve\nmultiplayer over the internet, just like it did for\nShogo.  We also have a few other multiplayer\nsurprises up our sleeves...more info soon...  :)\n\nI played what is now (I believe) the gold version\nof Gruntz over the weekend.  And, I think the Gruntz\ndemo is going to be available in a few weeks! \nThis game is a ton of fun (it's practically two\ngames in one) as well as full of \"Monolith-style\"\nhumor.  Stay tuned...  :)\n\nI leaked a few more Claw cheats to the Claw forum.\nIf you're a Claw fan, be sure to check em out.\nThere's actually only a few more left for me to\ngive out!\n\nIf you have created any levels for GM using the\neditor, please email them to me...I'd like to get\nsome user created levels posted for others to\ndownload and play.  Thanx!  :)\n\ngoble@lith.com\n11/18/98\n\nI'm back!  :)\n\nThe Shogo patch was released just a few hours after\nI got back!  I know we were a couple days late, but\nalthough this was supposed to be mainly a multi-\nplayer patch, we ended up throwing in a bunch more\nsingle player stuff too.  We actually ended up doing\na lot more than we originally planned--but I think\nit was well worth the extra effort!  Thanks to \neveryone who provided us with feedback, bug reports,\nhelped us test the patch, and generally supported us\nby sending positive vibes our way.  We really \nappreciate your patience as well. :)\n\nI almost forgot about a cool Blood2 feature that is\navailable in both the demo and the full version.\nHere's the scoop for...\n\nAdding Custom Blood2 Sounds!!!\n\nI set things up in Blood2 (full and demo) such that\neven the non-modder can easily add a few custom sounds\nfor The Chosen characters.  Here's all you gotta do:\n\nCreate a folder in your Blood2 install directory\ncalled \"Custom\" (full version does this for you).\n\nMake a sub-folder under \"Custom\" called \"Caleb\" (or\n\"Gabriella\", \"Ishmael\" or \"Ophelia\").  Note that the\ndemo only supports Caleb.\n\nUnder the \"Caleb\" folder (or \"Gabriella\", \"Ishmael\"\nor \"Ophelia\"), you can then make one or more of the\nfollowing sub-folders:\n\nIdle\nBigGib\nPain\nKill\nDeath\nBurning\nPowerup\nSpawn\nSuicide\nWeapon\nTaunt\nJump\n\nEach of the above folders is a sound \"group\". Stick as\nmany .WAV files as you want (any format) in one or more\nof the folders.  If a folder is empty, the game will\nuse the regular game sounds.  If a folder has .WAV\nfiles inside, it will randomly pick from these sounds\ninstead!\n\nFor the demo, you need to specify \"-rez custom\" on\nthe command-line.  You can have the demo launcher\nautomatically do this by adding it in the advanced\noptions (be sure to check the \"Always specify...\"\ncheck box).\n\nHope that all makes sense.  Enjoy!  :)\n\n11/12/98\n\nI will be out of the office until Wednesday\nNovember 18th.  They're gonna hafta release\nthe Shogo patch without me!  :)\n\nThe Shogo patch is looking awesome.  We did\nsome testing with a few external people tonight\nand everyone seems to love all the new server\noptions and the new DM levels!  (there's 8\nnew ones, I think)  I think the game is running\neven faster with the new tcpip driver.\n\nWe made the \"short\" list for the Blood2 patch\nthat will be available right around the time\nBlood2 hits the stores.  There's a few things\nwe want to tweak and I think we have some\nideas for a few more speed optimizations.\nAfter that, will be putting all the new internet\nmultiplayer code in for a multiplayer patch.\n\nI played a little Gruntz multiplayer with the\nGruntz demo today.  It was a blast!  I saw\nthe Gruntz box art during lunch and it's coming\nalong really well.\n\nRemember, if you send me an email and I don't\nrespond...it's not cuz I'm ignoring you, it's\ncuz I'm out of the office until 11/18.  Bye! :)\n11/6/98\n\nLot's of game news...\n\nBlood2 has gone Gold and the game is awesome!\nEverything really came together in the last few\nweeks!  I finally played through the whole thing\nand the story is really cool (and gory) and it\nis definitely a ton of fun.\n\nWe made some great optimizations that really \nimproved performance and the level designers\nworked their magic with the in-game cutscenes\nonce again.  This game is bursting at the seams\nwith content...I think the CD has less than 9\nmeg of free space!  Now that's a lot of content!\n\nAs promised, I rebuilt the Blood2 demo using all\nthe new code.  Jace has been doing some tests\nand the new build of the demo is WAY faster. \nPlus, it has all the new mouse tweaks that make\nit \"feel\" better.  QA is currently pounding on\nthe demo...so it should be available any day now.\nStay tuned!  :)\n\nShogo has got some new goodies too.  The patch\nis coming along well.  Mike and Stephens added\nsome cool new multiplayer options to LithTech\nand Shogo and I recently updated the ShogoSrv and\nShogo wizards to make many of them available to\nthe user.  I won't explain what they all are right\nnow (most of them are self-explanatory) but take\na look at one of the new options dialogs:\n\nhttp://users.lith.com/~goble/jpgs/options.jpg\n\nThe world/day/night/skycolor stuff that Mike added\nis awesome, BTW.  :)\n\nGruntz is in it's very final stages and should be\ngoing Gold on Monday!  The team has been fine-tuning\nsome of the puzzles and perfecting the multiplayer\ngameplay.  I haven't been able to play one of the\nmore recent builds...but I'm looking forward to it\nnow that I have a little more free time.  The intro\nmovie is still one of the best we've ever done IMO.\n\nAs many of you know there are only a few cheat codes\nin the Blood2 demo.  I think a few of them are known.\nWouldn't it be nice if there was a cheat code to skip\nto the second level so you could watch the cool intro\ncinematic again?  Do you think there might be a cheat\ncode in there to do this?  Wouldn't that be SUPER? I\nthink it would be SUPER.  But if there wasn't, my only\nresponse would be: \"ZUG\".  As in \"ZUG\" (just something\nI say occasionally).\n\nHave fun... ;)\n\n11/2/98\n\nThe full version of Blood2 could go Gold any hour\nnow!  We are so close!  We have made so much progress\nover the past few days.  With Mike's help, we made\nsome significant speed improvements as well as\nreduced the memory overhead.  The low and medium\ndetail settings will now make a much bigger/better\nimpact on the speed of the game--even high detail is\nrunning a lot smoother!\n\nIt's kind of funny how some of the best improvements\nand optimizations always find their way into a game\nat the very last second.  The Blood2 demo is already\nout there, and it doesn't have all of these great\nimprovements.  So, we will most likely release an\nupdated demo (and/or patch file) that includes all\nthis great new stuff.  If things go smoothly, we \ncan probably have it ready a few days after the full\nversion officially goes gold.  :)\n\nI just finished playing through the entire full\nversion of Blood2 (using cheats, of course) and the\ngame is absolutely incredible.  As a programmer,\nyou often play only a few of the levels, or even\na single test level where you test all your new\ncode--so you rarely get to see all the levels. But,\nsince we are so close to going Gold, I needed to\nhelp verify that you can get all the way through \nthe game--poor me.  :)\n\nI think most of you already know that I hate spiders.\nYes, Blood2 made me yell a few times...there are\nsome really spooky levels that were getting to me\nat 2am last night...the sounds and music didn't help\neither.  Plus, now there's creatures in there that\nare worse than the spiders!  Ack!\n\nWe're going to try to put out another *ALPHA* version\nof the Shogo patch to help get more feedback. I've\nbeen focused on Blood2 this past week, but I hear\nthings are still going well.  I should have more info\nin a couple of days.\n\n\n\n10/30/98\n\nThe Blood2 Demo will be released tonight at 9pm\npacific time!  Check out http://www.blood2.com\nand http://www.the-chosen.com for more info!\n\nThe demo is another hefty one...weighing in at a\ngory 36 Meg.  It's got 2 levels, 6 weapons, some\ngood baddies, and even a few cheat codes--but I'm\nnot telling what they are... :)\n\nThe full version of Blood2 is oh-so-close to being\ndone and it is looking really good...the in-game\ncinematics are awesome!  Being able to play any\none of The Chosen characters is really cool too.\n\nAfter Blood2 ships, I'll take a quick break and\nthen add all of the new Shogo multiplayer options\ninto the wizards.  Mike and I are hoping to add\nsome cool new connection features too.\n\nEnjoy the Blood2 demo!  :)\n\n\n10/24/98\n\nI just sent out a build of the Blood2 demo to the\nwhole team!  I am still waiting on a couple of level\ntweaks from billv and one more splash screen from\ngforce...but it's getting really close now.  The\nsecond level's intro cinematic is incredible!\n\nThe zip file for the Blood2 demo is probably going\nto be right around 34 Meg. Look for it early this\ncoming week!  :)\n\nIf you don't have Shogo or the Shogo demo, grab it\nnow so that you can make sure your 3D card's driver\nis working properly with DirectX6.  LithTech uses\nall the new 3D features in DirectX6, so a driver\nupdate is usually required (gee, I feel like I've\ntyped that before)\n\nWe are learning tons from the alpha of the Shogo\npatch we released!  I played in a bunch of big games\nlast night and it was a blast!  There were also some\nserver issues (hey, that's why it's an alpha :) and\nI am going to have to make some tweaks to ShogoSrv.\n\nMike and I talked about some network code changes\nwe can make that will help fix a bunch of the current\nissues.  I will be helping out as much as I can but\nmy number one priority right now is Blood2.  :)\n\nI've seen mostly positive feedback regarding the\nalpha patch's affect on Shogo single-player.  The\nAI tends to kick your butt during cinematics on the\nharder difficulty settings...but other than that,\nI haven't heard anything too major.  If you've been\nplaying Shogo single-player with the alpha version\nof the patch, please send us some feedback!  :)\n\n\n\n10/23/98\n\nI'm back on the late night schedule...so you know\nwe're in full-tilt crunch mode over here.  :)\n\nBlood2 is looking incredible!  This game is so\nbloody and gory, yet it can be so darn funny at\ntimes too!  There is so much awesome dialog in\nthe game!  Not too mention max gibbage!  :)\n\nThe Blood2 demo is actually almost done.  The\nhardest part has been deciding which weapons to\nput in.  I really started to like some of them\nand it's hard to decide what to do.  Part of me\nwants to put them in the demo because they are\nso awesome...and part of me thinks we shouldn't\nspoil all of the fun in the full version.\nDecisions Decisions...\n\nI did lobby hard for the assault rifle because\nI really like that one (I think I can hear Shade\nyelling in the other building as I give out more\ninfo without telling him) The DeathRay is just\nso awesome now...is it going in the demo?  I'm\nnot telling.  :P\n\nThe alpha version of the Shogo patch is right on\nschedule (don't you just love us :) and should \nbe available tomorrow evening!  I couldn't resist\nand jumped into a few of the bigger multiplayer\ngames (using GameSpy, which makes it sooo easy\nnow).  I could not really tell who had the fast\nconnections and who had the slow ones.  But, with\n16 people playing, there wasn't a lot of time to\nthink about it.  :)\n\nMike and I just coded in some ping info into\nShogoSrv and we also send it to GameSpy now.\nStephens said he played through a bunch of the\nsingle player levels and only encountered some\nminor problems.  It's still an alpha version of\nthe patch, however, so I'm sure there are still\nsome problems.  Be sure to read the readme!\n\n\n\n10/20/98\n\nBoth Shogo and Rage of Mages are in stores!\nBuy a copy today! http://store.lith.com\n\nShogo is doing great but we're still busting\nour bunz working on making it even better.\nThe patch is coming along well and I'm really\nhoping we can have it out *before* the November\n15th deadline!  Mike is adding more player\ninfo stuff (ping times, connect time, etc.)\nso I will add that to ShogoSrv soon.  My todo\nlist is growing, but Blood2 has priority for\nme currently.  Read on...\n\nOver the weekend, I some how volunteered\nmyself to lead the task of putting together\nthe Blood2 demo.  That's right, there will be\nan awesome Blood2 demo coming your way soon!\nShould be out early next week at the latest.\n(once I get something into QA's hands, I'll\nhave a better idea--it could b"}, {"by": "greg@lith.com", "time": 907915500, "contents": "Login: greg           \t\t\tName: Greg Kettell\nDirectory: /home/greg               \tShell: /bin/bash\nLast login Tue Sep 16 07:59 1997 (PDT) on ttyp0 from 208.8.216.193\nNew mail received Sat Oct  3 23:14 1998 (PDT)\n     Unread since Wed Feb 25 12:07 1998 (PDT)\nPlan:\n\n10/9/98\n\nA little Blood 2 anecdote...\n\nA few days ago, I was testing out some tweaks to our object spawner (a thing that can generate items/creatures/whatever in the game), and I needed something to test it with.\n\nSo I figured, maybe I'll spawn a Shikari and a Fanatic. the last time I really saw a Shikari, he was pretty much just standing around, more or less harmless. And since I didn't give the Fanatic a weapon, he wasn't going to be able to do anything to me while I'm testing other stuff.\n\nI shot the object that triggered the spawner, and sure enough, out pop a Shikari and a Fanatic.  But, Jesus H. Christ! That Shikari wasn't just standing there like I expected, he was charging right at me, and jumping! I managed to get off a couple of shots at him (I was only testing so I just had my beretta active), and I ran behind a wall to try to elude him.  He ran up to the fanatic and just tore the poor bastard to shreds like he was made of tissue paper or something, and then he started up with his \"loogies from hell\" as Loki calls em. There was a hapless civilian standing nearby, and at one point the Shikari paused in his assault on my ass and just as an afterthought he took out the civilian with a single spitball. The whole scene was a thing of beauty, considering it was totally unexpected and unplanned.\n\nAnyway, I finally managed to switch to my trusty howitzer and end it. but I'm not looking forward to facing a group of those dudes in the game.

It's a shame, really, especially since I went out and bought that Sega 4x VMU and made four new characters (Zaelunas [FOmar], Buzama[HUmar], Adeyaka[FOnewearl], and Kisokuen'en[RAcaseal]) that will likely never get used.\n\nI had fun with it, of course.

It's just a shame that (a) there aren't more areas to explore, and (b) most of the people on the servers, much like most of the people on the Internet, are complete morons.\n\nSo now, just like there aren't any real sports to watch for five months once the NHL and NBA playoffs are over, there aren't any cool RPGs coming out anytime soon that I'm looking forward to.  I'll probably buy Paper Mario, but other than that, I don't see much.  Last year was incredible, with what...ten awesome console RPG's to play?  This year, I'm not seeing much of anything until FFX.  Ah well.\n\nAnyway, nice talking to you.  Pick up the magazine.  Buy the game.  Visit the web site.  See the amazing contemplative mastermind monkey.  Talk to you later.\n\n-Grant"}, {"by": "guf@ionstorm.com", "time": 935522160, "contents": "\n*** Ion Storm's Finger Server\n\nUser name: guf\nPlan modified: Mon Aug 23 21:43:21 1999\n\n--------------------------\nChristian 'guf' Cummings\nguf@ionstorm.com\nLevel Designer\nIon Storm - Daikatana Team\n--------------------------\n\nI think the fact that I have no idea what to say is a clear indication that I should NOT have a plan file. ;)\n\n\"keep the faith, what e'er it be\"\n\nDISCLAIMER: you know the drill."}, {"by": "guf@ionstorm.com", "time": 937793640, "contents": "\n*** Ion Storm's Finger Server\n\nUser name: guf\nPlan modified: Sun Sep 19 22:56:40 1999\n\n--------------------------\nChristian 'guf' Cummings\nguf@ionstorm.com\nLevel Designer\nIon Storm - Daikatana Team\n--------------------------\nsunday, sept 9 '99\n--\nYeah!

IBM guys are handling this.\nThis is how this will work: You will be able to download the\nOS/2 version from most BBSs and ftp sites. It will work with\nyour registered wad or the shareware one. NO CHANGE. STILL NO CHANGE.\n\nSGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.\nIt is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.

It uses converted\nDOOM maps and runs them with flats for textures. It looks REALLY\ncool.\nOk, imagine this. You have a health thing and you don't need it.\nYou meet someone in the game who has a nice weapon but is really\nlow on health. You guys decide to exchange items. You don't really\ntrust this guy so you bring along a friend and tell him to hide out\nsomewhere with a bead on the other guy's head. You meet somewhere\nin the middle of a field and face off. You drop your health, he drops\nhis weapon and you both strafe over the object of your desire. You\nstart to back away (not turning your back on him) and suddenly decide\nyou're going to whack this guy before he gets a chance to use that\nhealth. You move towards him and draw back with your hammer. He notices\nthis and starts to duck, but it's too late. You smash him in the head\nand watch him fly down to the ground, landing on his side. You smash\nhis still body a few more times and cause him to explode! Now you and\nyour friend pick up all of the items your dead friend left on the\nground. As you are walking off you pick up his severed head and put\nit in a bag. That will come in useful later... when you need something\nto sacrifice to a demon.\n\nJohn has a faster engine working now. Groundwork for network play\nhas been finished. Looking VERY cool. For those of you who still\nhave a wife, kids, a job, and a life after DOOM, this game is for YOU.\nYou DOOM junkies will have a new fix...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ to help@idsoftware.com\n_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_\n\nWHAT IS iD?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

You run across the Morph Ovum and pick\nit up. You let your \"friend\" follow you a little longer and then you\nturn around and use the Morph on him... Four little \"eggs\" fly out\nand a few hit him. He squawks and hits the floor as a chicken.\nNow he has no weapon (except that wimpy beak) and all you have to do\nis catch him, pop him with your Dragon Claw a few times and watch\nthe feathers fly. You've never seen your friends so mad at being\nkilled by you until you turn them into a chicken and make them\ndie in a puff of feathers hehe... The game should be out in two weeks.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStatus of QUAKE---Updated: Fri, Dec 2nd 2:20pm\n\nThis will not be out until sometime next Winter.\nOk, ok... you guys wanted more.\nAs of today the following things are working/semi-working:\nNetwork play\nBasic Engine\nObject Modeling\nMap Editor\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nNetwork Play:\nServer/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on\na NeXT, Linux, or SGI box. Once the server is running you\nget on another machine (NeXT, Linux, SGI) and log into the server.\nA play window opens and you can see the other players, move around,\nquit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but this\nwill be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc, will\nbe added in later.\n\nBasic Engine:\nThis is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,\nbut this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single\nplayer.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the\nengine.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200\npolygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we\nwould need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail\nwe want. So far this is the only \"thing\" in the game. He does not\nanimate, but it is still cool to watch him be \"born\". At the moment\nhe is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.\n\nMap Editor:\nJohn also has a map editor in the works. At this point it looks\nsomewhat like 3D studio, with a camera view and a top down view\nof the thing you are working on. You can add and subtract blocks\nof \"material\" from the view. These are the building blocks of the\nworld... No, you will not be limited to blocks in the finished game.\n\nAll of this will come together very soon to create one of the most\nawesome network/3D games in the world... if not the most awesome\n(Ok, who are we kidding? It will be the most awesome hehe.)\n\n"}, {"by": "help@idsoftware.com", "time": 787554000, "contents": "Login name: help                              In real life: help desk\nDirectory: /cthulhu/Users/help              Shell: /bin/csh\nNever logged in.\nPlan:\nFinger in, finger out...\n\nHere you will find updated info on DOOM, DOOM II, and QUAKE.\nIf there is something else you would like to see updates on please\nsend mail to american@idsoftware.com.\n>>>> IF YOU DON'T SEE ANY UPDATES THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS NOTHING\n>>>> TO UPDATE YOU ON.

I'll admit at first I was not so impressed, the game\nlacked some of the finer details that make DOOM so fun, but now...\nsome have said it's better than, well... DOOM. The levels are\nbeautiful, the weapons are awesome, and DeathMatch now has an all\nnew feeling to it. IT WILL BE OUT WHEN IT'S FINISHED... SHOULD BE\nSOON. STOP ASKING!\n\nStrife: Still working. No updates.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStatus of DOOM Movie---Updated Thu, Nov 3rd 1:35pm\n\nStill in the birth process. Many very cool people have shown\ninterest in the project. There is no release date for the movie.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStatus of DOOM ports---Updated: Mon, Dec 12th 2:07pm\n\nQNX: DOOM for the QNX OS is anonymously ftp'able from quics.qnx.com.\nIt's compiled with Pentium optimizations and supports sound, music,\nthe VGA console and X Windows with pixel doubling and tripling.\nWe don't support this version, QNX Software Systems did the port.\nThis version will run the shareware, registered, or doom2 wadfile.\nThe files to ftp are:\n\n  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.pax.gz - Console and X versions of QNX DOOM\n  /usr/free/doom/doom1.wad.gz   - DOOM v1.666 wad file\n  /usr/free/doom/qnxdoom.faq    - Installation instructions and other\n  details\n\nOS/2: IBM showed a beta version of their port at Comdex, and it\nwas by all reports quite impressive--fully DIVE-ified (i.e.,\narbitrarily resizable window--including tall-and-skinny or short-\nand-fat) and very fast (\"DOS speed on the OS/2 desktop\").  It\ndoes NOT do 300fps on a 90MHz Pentium as some clown reported, but\nit is claimed to be faster than the WinDoom beta.  The unofficial\nword from the IBMers was that it would be out around mid-December.\n\nSGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.\nIt is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports\npixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound\nfor clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag. Do not send\nus mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.\n\nLINUX: the linux version is at:\nsunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/games/x11/action/doom/linxdoom.tgz\nsunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/games/x11/action/doom/doom1wad.tgz\nand may be moved to whatever appropriate directory later. Do not\nsend us mail about this. We will delete it. NO CHANGE.\n\nJAG: It's out now. Go buy it. Everyone likes it.\n\nMAC: We have found a team to do this. There is no release date.\nWe just got some Power PCs to test the beta\nversion on. It should be here soon. Please do NOT ask to test\nthis. There is no more info on this at this time. NO CHANGE.\n\nWINDOWS: We just got a beta of this. Looks AWESOME. Still no\nrelease date. The MICROSOFT guys are working on this. NO CHANGE.\n\nNEXTSTEP: There is a version 1.2 available from cs.orst.edu. There\nwill not be another patch until we send out the finished version.\nOmnigroup is working on a new NEXTSTEP release of\nDOOM with interceptor direct framebuffer access, sound,\ncustomizable controls, and lots of other features.\nA DOOM II release will also be available.\nURL for the info page at Omni's WWW site:\n  http://www.omnigroup.com/Software/Doom/\n\nSega 32X: Released. Everyone is spooging over this one, too.\nBuy it.\n\nUltra 64: This is being worked on. Little info at this time. It\nwill be a while before you hear anything about this.\n\nThere will never be a port to these machines:\nAmiga, Sinclair 2000, Apple //gs, TRS-80.\n\nIf there is not a release date on one of the above that means it\ndoesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.\nIf I had more I would put it here.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStatus of QUAKE---Updated: Fri, Dec 2nd 2:20pm\n\nThis will not be out until sometime next Winter.\nOk, ok... you guys wanted more.\nAs of today the following things are working/semi-working:\nNetwork play\nBasic Engine\nObject Modeling\nMap Editor\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nNetwork Play:\nServer/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on\na NeXT, Linux, or SGI box. Once the server is running you\nget on another machine (NeXT, Linux, SGI) and log into the server.\nA play window opens and you can see the other players, move around,\nquit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but this\nwill be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc, will\nbe added in later.\n\nBasic Engine:\nThis is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,\nbut this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single\nplayer.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the\nengine.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200\npolygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we\nwould need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail\nwe want. So far this is the only \"thing\" in the game. He does not\nanimate, but it is still cool to watch him be \"born\". At the moment\nhe is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.\n\nMap Editor:\nJohn also has a map editor in the works. At this point it looks\nsomewhat like 3D studio, with a camera view and a top down view\nof the thing you are working on. You can add and subtract blocks\nof \"material\" from the view. These are the building blocks of the\nworld... No, you will not be limited to blocks in the finished game.\n\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ to help@idsoftware.com\n_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_\n\nWHAT IS id?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

It\nwill be a while before you hear anything about this.\n\nThere will never be a port to these machines:\nAmiga, Sinclair 2000, Apple //gs, TRS-80.\n\nIf there is not a release date on one of the above that means it\ndoesn't have one. Please DO NOT send mail asking for info on the ports.\nIf I had more I would put it here.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStatus of QUAKE---Updated: Tue, Jan 24th 8:48pm\n\n********\nTHERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*!\nTHERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST RIGHT NOW EITHER.\nWE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.\n********\n\nThis will not be out until sometime in the Winter of '95.\nOk, ok... you guys wanted more.\nAs of today the following things are working/semi-working:\nNetwork play\nBasic Engine\nObject Modeling\nMap Editor\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nNetwork Play:\nServer/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on\na NeXT, Linux, or SGI box. Once the server is running you\nget on another machine (NeXT, Linux, SGI) and log into the server.\nA play window opens and you can see the other players, move around,\nquit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but this\nwill be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc, will\nbe added in later.\n\nBasic Engine:\nThis is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,\nbut this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single\nplayer.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the\nengine.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200\npolygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we\nwould need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail\nwe want. So far this is the only \"thing\" in the game. He does not\nanimate, but it is still cool to watch him be \"born\". At the moment\nhe is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.\n\nMap Editor:\nJohn also has a map editor in the works. At this point it looks\nsomewhat like 3D studio, with a camera view and a top down view\nof the thing you are working on. You can add and subtract blocks\nof \"material\" from the view. These are the building blocks of the\nworld... No, you will not be limited to blocks in the finished game.\n\n**We will not be adding anything new to this for a while.\nThere are MANY cool new things going into the game right now, but\nwe do not want to give it all away just yet. We have been creating\nsmall test levels for the past few weeks, and these are looking\nawesome. The general game idea has started to solidify, but please\ndo not write asking what it is.\nI will add some new stuff here when there is *alot* more to add.\n\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS id?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

Like that Chris guy. Man, what a 'tard.\nOk, ok... you guys wanted more.\nAs of today the following things are working/semi-working:\nNetwork play\nBasic Engine\nObject Modeling\nMap Editor\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nNetwork Play:\nServer/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on\na DOS, NeXT, Linux, or SGI etc... box. Once the server is running you\nget on another machine (DOS, NeXT, Linux, SGI, etc) and log into the\nserver. A play window opens and you can see the other players, move\naround, quit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but\nthis will be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc,\nwill be added in later.\nThis is still the same. There have been no changes.\n\nBasic Engine:\nThis is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,\nbut this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single\nplayer.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the\nengine.\nThis is running faster everyday. We are using other maps to test on\nnow and things are looking very awesome.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200\npolygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we\nwould need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail\nwe want. So far this is the only \"thing\" in the game. He does not\nanimate, but it is still cool to watch him be \"born\". At the moment\nhe is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.\nWe have a couple of different monster and person models now.\nThe all look very good.\n\nMap Editor:\nThe map editor is completely finished. We have been working with\nit for a while now, creating new levels.\n\n**We will not be adding anything new to this for a while.\nThere are MANY cool new things going into the game right now, but\nwe do not want to give it all away just yet. We have been creating\nsmall test levels for the past few weeks, and these are looking\nawesome. The general game idea has started to solidify, but please\ndo not write asking what it is.\nI will add some new stuff here when there is *a lot* more to add.\n\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nWHAT IS id?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

It just slows us down.\nThanks.\n\n****\nYou can find screenshots of some of our Quake stuff\non ftp.idsoftware.com in /idstuff/quake. The file is quakepix.zip.\nBy the way, Quake is an action game, not an RPG.\n****\n\nCarmack just finished changing over the structure/compiler for\nthe Quake interpreted language. It needed to be optimized. We\nspent some time changing our old code over, and now things\nare working great again.\nWe have two functioning monsters in right now. One is the\nknight that you saw in the screen shots and the other is an\nogre that just got finished. The knight chases you around and\nslashes at you with his sword and the ogre has a huge axe and\na missile attack. Both of these monsters look extremely cool.\nThe artists are currently working on new monsters and on\nsome nice demonic textures for the game. We are starting to\nget some of the really disturbing art in now... makes DOOM\nlook like a place to take children instead of the zoo:)\nSome misc. things we have been working on: some changes to\nlighting, network code, getting the game running on some\naccelerator boards, getting new monsters in, working on environmental\nhazards, levels, etc... etc...\n\nThis will not be out until sometime around this Christmas.\n\nThings that work:\nnetwork play, mouse control, lighting,\nsprite engine, sound, entity programming,\npolygon engine, map editor\n\nThings we are working on:\nspeed, speed, monsters, speed, maps\nsound effects w/help from Trent\nand a lot more.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nNetwork Play:\nServer/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on\na DOS, NeXT, Linux, or SGI etc... box. Once the server is running you\nget on another machine (DOS, NeXT, Linux, SGI, etc) and log into the\nserver. A play window opens and you can see the other players, move\naround, quit out, get back in, etc... Deathmatch is working a little\nnow and we can run around and shoot each other with fireballs.\n\nEngine:\nThis is running very fast. We have completed some really great\nlooking levels that we are running around in. The lighting is\ntoo good to believe. There are doors/plats/switches/etc... in\nthe game now.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin is working on creating the monsters/players and Michael\nis making them draw really fast. These are looking great. Sprites\nsuck compared to proper models.\n\nMap Editor:\nThe map editor is completely finished. We have been working with\nit for a while now, creating new levels.\n\nPlease do not send us mail about Quake. It just slows us down.\nThanks.\n\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n********\nTHERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*!\nTHERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST EITHER.\nWE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.\n********\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nStatus of DOOM---Updated: Fri, Jul 28th 3:22pm\n\nWe have mastered The Ultimate DOOM! *This is out in stores now*.\nThere is a patch for registered DOOM owners that will turn your\nDOOM into Ultimate DOOM for free.

Here is some sort of cheesy, lame-ass attempt\nat an update. Hope you're happy. You just wasted time\nwe could have spent making Quake come out tomorrow. Now\nit will have to wait until Spring :)\n\nYou all want to know why Quake is not going to be out\nuntil Spring... well, here it is: We are making it better.\nThat is all there is to it. We refuse to release something\nthat we are not going to have fun playing, because that\nmeans that you probably won't have fun playing it. We\ntook a good look at where the game was going and decided\nto take it in some other direction. Yes, it will still be\neverything you ever wanted from the original Quake idea,\nminus some things we thought sucked, and plus some things\nthat we think were missing from the old design.\n\nThings that work:\nJust about everything.\n\nThings we are working on:\nSpeed, monsters, actual game play :), more\nweapons, figuring out some way to have all\nthe people who send us mail bugging us about\nQuake run over by a truck. Joystick code,\nitems, environmental hazards, etc...\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nNetwork Play:\nWe have DeathMatch! (This is really why we are delaying the\nrelease... we have been playing DM too much.)\nRight now we can start up a game with n players and\nrun around killing each other all day long. You\ncan leave the game, and then jump back in whenever\nyou like (as long as the server is still running.)\nDeathMatch right now is great, and it is going to\nget even better. We have found the replacement for\nDOOM DeathMatch... finally :)\n\nEngine:\nAll VESA resolutions are now in. Video hardware support\nis in and working for some cards now. This means that\nyou can run 640x480 at high frame rates. I mean *high*\ntoo. The engine is just about done. There is not much\nmissing from it now. Textures and modeling are rock solid.\nAt this point we are working on the game itself and the\nengine details... minor but important stuff.\n\nMap Editor:\nCarmack just rewrote the editor to allow us more\nflexibility while designing levels. This took some\ntime, but it was worth it. We are now able to\ndo things that were once impossible with the old\neditor.\n\nOk, there it is. Just to be nice I am going to\ngive everyone out there the chance to get some\nstuff added that you think might be missing.\nIf there is something important (*important*)\nmissing from the above text, you send me some\nmail and tell me. I probably will not reply unless\nyou ask something so dumb that I have to tell you\nhow dumb it was. I will take questions and try to\nanswer them here until the end of the week.\nThat's FRIDAY, Dec 8th. Then I am going to delete\nthis message and ignore all Quake related mail for\nquite some time.\n\nWe really don't want to piss you all off by ignoring your\nquestions while we are working on this game, but this is\na small company with limited resources to answer all of\nyour mail about Quake. You get one week and I will try to\nanswer all the questions I can. The ones I cannot\nanswer I will try to put in here so that you do not\nall waste your time trying to get the same non-answerable\n(that is a word :) question answered.\n\nSend your mail to american@idsoftware.com\n\nPlease, no novels about what you think Quake\nshould be, and try to ask questions that can\nbe answered in simple yes and no answers.\nCheck here every day to see if someone else\nhas already asked your question before mailing\nthem off to me. Thanks.\n\n1monSkey \\'men-ke!\\\n[prob. of LG origin; akin to Moneke, name of an ape, prob. of\nRomance origin; akin to OSp mona monkey] (ca. 1530)\n1: a primate mammal with the exception of man and usu. the\nlemurs and tarsiers; esp: any of the longer tailed primates\nlike Munchkin as contrasted with the apes, which Munchkin can\nonly go down on if he pays them.\n2a: a person resembling a monkey or Munchkin.\n3: Any semi-primate descended from Munchkin's mom.\n\n-----------Quake Questions Answered------------------\n: will Quake still be medieval as planned?\nYes. The architecture will remain the same,\nbut we are planning on some new stuff. Not saying\nwhat yet though.\n\n: Also, Romero mentioned looking up and down was a lot\n: easier in Quake than it was in Heretic.\nYes, it will be. There will be more automatic looking\nup and down which means that you will not have to worry\nabout doing it yourself. This will not interfere with\ngameplay though.\n\n: I just bought a 3 button logitech mouse with the assumption\n: that it'd be a bit easier to handle Quake with 3 buttons.\n: Is this in any way true?\nAs far as mice go, this will be the way to do it. There\nmay be other controllers out there more suited to Quake\nby the time it comes out though. Right now we are all\nusing Logitech three button mice.\n\n: Romero stated that id would be unable to use the name Quake\n: since some German company copywrote it first. Any word on\n: the new name (assumadly you'll copywrite it before releasing\n: it this time).\nWe have a new name, but like you said, we cannot release\nit until we have it copyrighted.\n\n: Any major differences between Quake and DOOM deathmatch, besides\n: free coming and going from games?\nWell, these things could change... but right now when you\nkill someone who is carrying rockets he might explode and\ntake you with him:) Also, when you kill someone they dump\nall the ammo they were carrying. There are more, but we\nare not going to get into it right now.\n\n: Do you guys expect to get a fluid\n: game with a bunch of 28800 ppp people\nYes.\n\n: Also, will there be more dmatch \"modes\", such as team games\n: like capture the flag or team wars?\nYes, and it will be very easy for the person running the\nserver to program these games in if he/she wants to.\n\n: Also, since Quake will supposedly offer the ability to play with\n: many many people on one map, how will individuals be differentiated?\nYou will be able to use different \"skins\" so that you\ncould have a huge dragon on the front of your guy etc...\n\n: Any word on how servers will function?\nNot going into this right now.\n\n: On a minor, technological note, any realtime shadows yet?\nNo, this will probably be in our next game though.\n\n: Movable walls in any way?\nAlready in there.\n\n: What about monster AI, will it be slimmed down to near-doom\n: levels to up speed in other areas?\nMonster AI will be much cooler than DOOM AI. Already is.\n\n: Will tcp/ip support be built in?\nAlready is.\n\n: I have read that it will be possible to actually edit maps\n: while \"live action\" is taking place.\nThis will not be possible.\n\n: Along those lines, will it (can it?) be possible to\n: allow a person to directly control a monster (non-player\n: character) in the same manner one controls his/her hero?\nThis could be possible, but we are not going to include the\ncode to allow you to do this. It would be something you\nwould have to add in yourself. It would not be hard to\nadd though.\n\n: i want to be prepared, so what are the h/w requirements\n: for the Quake server?\nWe are not releasing these specs yet. They will not be\ntoo hard to take though.\n\n: What about the Mac version of Quake? When will it come out\n: and what differences will there be?\nThis will eventually happen, and the difference will be that\nit is on the Mac.\n\n: Also, any chance in hell I will be able to run smoothly over\n: the net on my puny little 14.4?\nYour modem would not be the problem here, it would be the net...\nbut you might be able to find a server with a small amount of\nlag that would be playable.\n\n: You mentioned joystick code, is the joystick going to be a plausible\n: way to control your character in Quake (unlike doom) with (I'm assuming)\n: variable sensitivity and analog support?\nThe joystick code will be cool. Better than in DOOM, and should be\na cool way to control looking up and down (with a hatstick).\n\n: Is there anything planned regarding 3D rendering card support?\nAs said above, we have this working and it is cool.\n\n: Can walls be damaged or destroyed during combat?\nNo.\n\n: Does Quake incorporate traps and puzzles to allow\n: allow unarmed players to overcome armed apponents\n: by using their wits and stealth?\nNo, there is no violence in that now is there?\n\n: How will close combat weapons be handled?\nAs simply as possible. Push the key. No more than that.\n\n: How does the character's speed/control compare to DOOM?\n: Will we still be able to mouse-flick 180 degrees and\n: strafe-run etc?\nHell yes. Do you really think that we would let the keyboard\nlamers play the same game as those who know the *right* way\nto play?!\n\n: Which video cards will you be enabling hardware support for?\nWe are speaking of the hardware accelerator boards here. You\nwill be able to use any card that someone bothers to write a\ndriver for. We are making sure that it is possible to write\nexternal drivers for things like this.\n\n: Are we still going to be able to play peer-to-peer deathmatch games?\nYes, you would just run the server on one of the machines\nthat you are using... that machine would act as client to\nitself.\n\n: Will it be possible to setup a \"Quake\" server in conjunction with a\n: multi-line bbs (even if the players have to access it thru slip on the\n: network).\nYes.\n\n: Can we expect a demo/screen shots in the next month or two? Atleast a\n: freakin animation!?\nNo answer on this.\n\n: WHats the current weapon count? What will the final count be?\nThree right now. We are not sure of the final count.\n\n: Have any new monsters been completed?\nYes. I would like to describe some of them, but that is\ninfo that we cannot release right now.\n\n: Has Into the Shadows had and effect on the release date?\nNo.\n\n: Can players be on multiple levels in dmatch? Like You and I (yeah right)\n: in level 1, and Jromero in 2?\nIf the OS that you are running the server under is something\nreal like Linux you will be able to do this.\n\n: 1. Is Trent still doing the sounds, or is that being redone too?\nYes, Trent is still doing the sounds. And doing a great job too.\n\n: 2. You mentioned rockets -- in a medieval setting ?\nHmmm... things could change you know.\n\n: Is the target hardware still 486 dx/2 66 w/ 8mb and non 3d card?\n: If so, at what res will it be running?\nIt does run on this, but you have to size the screen down a\nlittle bit. We are still working on getting the speed up,\neven though it is running very fast right now anyway.\n\n: Any price yet?\nNope.\n\n: Is it easy to modify your character so that you will look\n: different than the others in a deathmatch?\nYou would just give yourself a new skin texture. Should not\nbe too hard to do.\n\n: So what comes after Quake? Spooge....\nWait and see.\n\n: How many levels will the shareware be?\nSame as DOOM.\n\n: Will weapons be multipurpose (like Dark forces; hit an\n: alternate key and throw the hammer instead)?\nThis is possible.\n\n: Story so far?\nHahaha!\n\n: Character Demo? Hehehhehehehe\nNot yet, but we will send something out soon.\n\n: ARE YOU KEEPING THAT STUPID HAMMER,and THERE WILL be multiple\n: weapons a yes,no and a yes,no Is all I need\nWe are not saying about this right now.\n\n: Do you plan on releasing the map\n: editor/graphic/sound editors you used for the game?\nYes, we will be doing this.\n\n: Trent's going to be doing the FX, correct? I've read interviews\n: with romero that've said there will be no music, and there will\n: be trent's music. What's going on? :)\nTrent is doing the SFX for sure and we are trying to\nfigure out if we are going to be able to include a seperate\nsound track with the game (done by Trent).\n\n: Is id still planning on doing a Sony PlayStation version...and will\n: you consider supporting dial-up with that version?\nWe would like to but we cannot make any promises this early.\n\n: If one were planning on running a server and/or doing a load of editing,\n: would you recomend submerging one-self's in NeXTSTEP or LINUX to prepare?\nWell, the only OS you would want to run a *real* server on would\nneed to be under some multitasking OS like Linux or Next, but you\ncan run simple (single level, multiplayer) servers on a DOS box.\nAs far as the editors go... we will probably release the Next and\na WIN95 version of QuakeEd.\n\n: Will it be possible to swim in Quake?\nYes.\n\n: Will a multi-player game be possible using a single computer\n: playing split-screen, instead of needing a network?\nNo.\n\n: You mentioned peer to peer will work by having one machine act as\n: server and client. Will this give any advantage to either machine in\n: terms of performance?\nThe machine acting as client and server will suffer some, but\nnot a lot.\n\n: Will there be flying in Quake? If so, will it be controlled like\n: Heretic/Hexen (fly up/down) or like descent (fly where you point)?\nThere will be a lot of tossing and involuntary leaving the ground:)\nBut there probably won't be any sustained flying.\n\n: Will quake support/use math co-pros.\nNo.\n\n: Is the software required to run a server included in the game?   Will it be\n: present in the shareware version in one form or another?\nYes. Yes.\n\n: How is Quake looking in comparison to DN3D?  Is Apogee making you sweat as\n: much now as they did releasing Blake Stone on the eve of Doom's release?\nHahahah.\n\n: Are any of Trent's sound FX going to revolve around the \"piggy\" theme that\n: is so prevalent in his music?\nSo far they have not, but we will have to wait and see. We have\nnot put any restraints on him... the sfxs are his deal.\n\n: Will there be fog in Quake?\nNot in Quake. Next game.\n\n: Also, will it be possible to QUICKLY kill people (one shot in the back,\n: point blank)?  Will there be body part-specific damage?\nYes and yes.\n\n: would quake client/server run under win95? i mean, using winsock32 and\n: win95 based calls.\nYes.\n\n: if i can have 2 machines networked locally, which one should be running\n: quake server?\nThe faster machine.\n\n: would i be able to run quake server in win95?\nYes.\n\n: Will \"Quake\" have any moving light sources?\nNo. The engine is not set up for things like this.\n\n: Will Quake have full support for the Logitech Cyberman?\nYes, we will include the \"hammer driver\" with Quake so that\nyou can smash the shit out of your CyberMan and by a real controller.\n\n: Will you be able to tell what weapons / armour / artifacts a guy\n: is carrying (before he gets a chance to use them)?\nYes.\n\n: 1st - Will there still be \"voice support\" through the network.  i.e.\n: speaking through a mic and the people \"closest\" to you can hear\n: you while the people furtherst away might faintly hear you or not\n: hear you at all.\nThis will be in there soon.\n\n: 2nd - How will the support be with the VFX1 virtual reality helmet?\nIt will be great. Don't worry.\n\n: 3rd - Can damage be inflicted to certain areas of the body  i.e. if I\n: hit someone in the left shoulder, will they be knocked back in that\n: area?  Will they bleed from that area?\nYes, they will show the damage in the area where you hit them.\n\n: 1.)  Will Quake support 16bit or 24bit color modes?\n16bit under DOS and you can get 24bit under other OSs.\n\n: 2.)  Will Quake be a native Win95 app?\nThere will be a version of this, yes.\n\n: What Operating System will Quake come out for first?\n: DOS? Win95?(Not that Win95 is an OS) Linux?\nDOS, Linux, WIN95, NeXT, IRIX, and maybe more.\n\n: What Operating System will the server Software run under?\n: Unix? Linux? Sun?\nAll of the above.\n\n: What special fees will be involved in running a Quake Server?\nWe have not decided on how this will work yet.\n\n: I read somewhere that all level editing/creating would be done\n: through text (indicating object, coordinates, texture, etc.) to\n: make it easier for people to create level editors. Is this true?\nLevel editing is done in a CAD-like program that we created,\ncalled QuakeEd. When creating objects in the world that you\ninteract with though, you program these in QuakeC.\n\n: Could you tell us a little bit more about how the\n: character animations are done?\nKevin Cloud created monsters/characters with Alias and\nthen animates them and generates frames. The frames are\nthen played back in the QuakeC code whenever the character\nattacks/moves etc...\n\n:  In \"quake\", will the water be maybe deeper, and to make it more\n: realistic, will walking/wading through water slow you down?\nYou will be able to go underwater in Quake.\n\n: Will ammunition be a light source (e.g. fire a rocket and it lights up\n: the corridor as it flies)?\nNo.\n\n: Will there be support for I-glasses and other *TRUE*\n: stereoscopic headsets?\nYes.\n\n: Just out of curiosity...Has id thought about setting up it's own quake\n: network (national, or, in any case, big and public)?\nWe are thinking about this.\n\n: How will the differentiating of other quake players in deathmatch\n: be incorporated? Will we have a charatcer editor for the DM?\nThey will be different colors, or they will have a new skin.\nYou can edit the skins with any paint program that will load\n.lbms.\n\n: 2) Will the DOS version run faster than the Linux version,\n: or vice versa?\nThey will be about the same.\n\n: I herd a rummor that Quake would be ported to Linux like\n: Doom was.  Is there any plans for this or possible plans?\nYes. We love Linux and there will be a Quake version for it.\nWe are hoping that people will realize that Linux is the\nway to go if they want to set up a proper Quake server\nmachine.\n\n: Question 1) Will it be possible to cause environmental damage, such as\n: taking out entire walls in a firefight?\nNo.\n\n: Question 2) Is it possible to dismember enemies?  ie, if I don't like\n: someone's head (or other portion of their physionomy) can I cut it off?\nYes.\n\n: Will \"quake\" be a doom-like slugfest or will you ( and them) be harder to\n: kill then just one blast?\nCome on. Do you want to *wait* to kill someone by pounding on\nthem with a stick for a while... or do you want to shove a\nshotgun under their chin and watch their brains hit the ceiling?!\nSlugfest.\n\n:    Will there be outdoor landscapes that are really spread out\n: like a huge grass area or forest or some kind of terrain, or is it mostly\n: within the castle sorta thing?\nMostly indoors.\n\n: ah yes, i almost forgot.. will quake use wads of some sort? or will\n: everything be in an external file?\nSounds and qc files will be external. Maps and textures will be in\nwads, although we are not calling them that now:)\n\n: Can you move, pile up, or stand on top of dead bodies? Heheheh\n: (alt.games.quake)\nYes, these things are already in there and quite funny.\n\n: How long do we have to wait for the editor to be released?\nUntil the game is released.\n\n: Can we leave markings on walls (bullet holes)?\nNo.\n\n: You keep mentioning \"next game\" for new features...does this\n: mean Quake II or a different series?\nThis means the next game engine after Quake.\n\n: On the experience part I just wanted to add that it would be nice to be\n: able to save a character and play with him throughout the gamer's\n: QUAKE experience.\nThis is something that we intend to have in there. It will\nbe very cool when playing with persistent servers.\n\n: 1)\tWill there be a shareware release? and when?\nYes. When it is finished.\n\n: 2)\tWhat actions can be performed? eg: Running, climbing, rolling,\n: crouching, jumping, leaning etc.\nRight now there is jumping and leaning... there will be\nclimbing (maybe).\n\n: 3)\tI know that heads can be cut off, what about arms, legs, torso's etc.\nDepends on the creature you are attacking. Basically you cannot\ndo this all the time to all creatures (too many frames) but\nwe are going to make sure you can do this sometimes.\n\n: 4)\tAre you guys still supporting the Verite Rendition card? What about\n: Lockheed & Martin's Cards.\nWe are supporting the Rendition card. All others cards will be\nable to be added later by others.\n\n: 5)\tWill there be Day and Night? Weather effects?\nProbably not... but we will see.\n\n: 6)\tStill able to sacrifice to the Daemons???\nOf course.\n\n: 7)\tHow much interaction with the environment will there be?? like moving\n: boxes, smashing things, leaving marks on the environment (burn marks from a\n: spell say for instance)\nWe are not sure yet... depends on how much we think it adds\nto the actual gameplay once it is in... these things sometimes\nlook cool the first time but then get to be old after a while.\n\n: 8)\tAre your 3D polygon character models as detailed as the models in\n: Triton's Into the Shadows? (The guys hair and tunic moves!! V-cool!)\nThey are pretty detailed. ITS and Quake are two totally different\ntypes of games though... it is not fair to either product to make\nthese comparisons.\n\n: 9)\tI know you've said there will be no shadows from the characters, but\n: come on, if Into the Shadows can manage Multiple shadows, Why not Quake???\n: What specifically is stopping you from implementing them. Without them the\n: characters dont look like they belong in the scene if ya know what I mean?!\nSee above.\n\n: this is prolly a stupid question, but will I be able to play quake\n: over a regular modem with a friend, without a server/client deal?\nI will do some explaining for those of you who do understand how\nthis is going to work. The client is the machine that you will\nbe playing the game on. It is the machine that all the graphics\nget drawn by, and all your input goes into. The server is the\nmachine that takes care of all the difficult computations\nneeded in order to create realistic environments like the ones\nin Quake. When running Quake on one PC you are actually running\nboth the client and the server on the same machine. There are\na few different combinations that Quake will allow when it comes\nto this though... you could 1) play single player with the client\non one machine and the server on another. 2) play multiplayer with\nthe clients on different machines all over the place and the server\non a separate machine or 3) play multiplayer with the server running\non one of the machines that is also being used as a client. In\neffect, one of the guys is going to use his machine as the server\nfor everyone else (including himself) and the client for himself.\nSo... in your situation you could do this two ways: 1) you could\nset up the server for the game and your client on your machine\nand have your friend call you or 2) you guys could set up a separate\nmachine with two modems in it and you both call it to play. (there\nare other combinations but I think you get the idea.) Whew... lot's\nof text and I bet that made no sense at all :)\n\n: 1.In previous DOOM DOOM2 etc. each computer had to have a copy of the\n: wad(pwad) file to play a homebrew level(s). Will it be possible in\n: Quake to Xfer levels between computers or at least from the server\n: to play a game? This would be a welcome feature for playing over the\n: net and also LANs.\nWe are working on a way to include all the sounds/gfx in the\nwad file so that each wad file contains it's own gfx palette\nand sounds... this way you have one file that contains everything\nand you could potentially transfer this file to a server. This code\nis not in there yet, and we may not put it in there ourselves,\nbut it would not be hard to add.\n\n: 2.Will their be some sort of a licence site (for a LAN) / package?\nThere will be, but we are not sure about how it is going to work\nyet.\n\n: Are you going to create a dynamic outdoor setting, too?\nThe game is better suited to cool indoor areas, but you could\ndo outside areas also. We are thinking in terms of levels\nthat everyone out there can play, and so we are trying to\nmake sure that the levels we create have a good balance\nof coolness/speed. There should be some nice outdoor areas\nin Quake.\n\n: Okay, you may not want to release direct info on the server hardware\n: requierements right now, but i am wondering how many users will a Server\n: running on a Pentium 120 (with enough mem) will be able to support? (A\n: rough number at least)\nWe honestly do not know yet. We have been running some servers\non a P90 and we have hooked in around 9 clients without any slow\ndown at all. The max number is not really known yet... but I think\nit will be pretty high.\n\n: Also, assuming people are playing on a server via 28.8K modems, how many\n: users can there be in the game before the game strts getting slugish?\nAgain, we do not know about this. Modem code is not finished\nyet and we have not set up a machine with a ton of modems in\nit yet to test this. It will be pretty high though.\n\n: First, I assume the Quake version for win95 will incorperate directdraw,\n: and all those neat goodies. Will it run faster on a win95 platform as\n: opposed to DOS or LINUX?\nIt will be about the same speed.\n\n: Will it be possible to kill enemies, gain experience for that, and thus\n: grow in power and hp's?\nThis is something that will be possible in DeathMatch, but we\nare not thinking about doing in the actual game. We will\nsee.\n\n: What controller would you recommend when this comes out?\nRight now we are all using Logitech three button mice, but\nsomething cooler might come along before we release.\n\n: How much longer after the DOS release will the Win95 release be?\nThey should come out about the same time. The DOS version we have\nnow will run fine under WIN95 though.\n\n: Will it be possible to hide in the shadows of a corner and thus jump\n: an enemy from behind and crush his skull in?\nYes.\n\n: Is this going to be a CD-ROM game, and if so what kind of speed would\n: you be looking at?\nNope. CD-ROM does not == action.\n\n: Will it be possible to record a game ie: doom lmp's?\nYes.\n\n: Will Quake support the Microsoft Sidewinder Pro, especially the swivel\n: feature?\nFor those of you asking if we are going to support x or y please\nunderstand something: We are writing Quake in such a way that\nwhen we release it the manufactures of these products will be\nable to quickly and easily add support for their products. Chances\nare that many of the cool people out on the net will be writing\nmost of the device drivers for all the cool add ons you want.\n\n: The thing that facinates me about quake is its 3D aspect.  Will you provide\n: true floor over floor design and will the outside environment be realistic?\nFloor over floor is already in there. Has been since the beginning.\nOutsides will be cool.\n\n: What color depth will Quake run in?\nRight now the only depth we are sure of is 8bit. It may ship\nwith the ability to run 8, 16, 24... but we are not sure.\nIt does not matter because the only thing that looks better\nthan 8bit is 24bit, and it is not that big of a difference.\n(This is all under DOS) If you are running under Next you\ncan get 24bit and Linux can get 8 or 16bit.\n\n: I would like to know just how much freedom will quakeC give me.\n: Will it be like a suped dehacked, where all I can do is make new\n: levels monsters and weapons.\nIn QuakeC you will have control over all objects in the world\nsuch as doors, players, weapons, monsters, items etc... This means\nyou could totally reprogram any one of these things from scratch\nor just make minor modifications if you wanted to. You could\nalso turn Quake into a new game with some modifications to\nthe QuakeC and with some changes in the actual C code. (We are\ngoing to release as much of this as we can).\n\n: you mention that QuakeEd will be released w/\n: Quake but for creating objects that you interact with\n: you will need to program in QuakeC.  Will you then\n: also release a QuakeC compiler?\nAll you need to edit QuakeC is a text editor. The QuakeC will\ngo out with the game in the same form that we are working on\nit here. The compiler is built into the game and compiles the\ncode every time you run the game.\n\n: If you w/ a fast puter and somebody w/ a slow puter\n: are loged into the same Quake server, will you be able\n: to run/shoot faster than him?\nThe guy with the fast computer will have a higher frame rate\nand he will get more updates to the server than the other guy...\nin effect he will have an advantage, but on the other hand if\na dork with a slow computer joins a game where everyone is playing\nwith extremely fast systems and connects he will not cause everyone\nelse to slow down.\n\n: 1.) will quake be so advanced that other software companies will\n: not be able to claim that their game is \"like-quake, only better\"\n: or will the engine be easily cloned within a year after the\n: initial release?\nI refuse to answer these types of questions on the grounds that\nI want to say something like \"Quake will smash the shit out of\nall other games... and other game companies pee on themselves.\"\nIf I say things like that I get flamed by other game companies...\nand besides, it's not \"professional\" :)\n\n: 2.) will the quake engine be licensed for other games?\n: possibly a DOOM 3?\nOf course.\n\n: 3.) do you guys realize how freaking anxious all of us are for\n: the release?\nUh, no. Really? I've only gotten 200+ pieces of mail in the\nlast 12 hours!\n\n: How will the auto-mapping be handled?\nThere probably will be no automap.\n\n: How will lmp recording be handled? The same as Doom or from room\n: cameras or something different?\nSame as in DOOM, although it would not be hard to get cameras\nin there.\n\n: Will there a weapon that is as satisfying as\n: the Doom shotgun/super shotgun..\n:) Wait and see.\n\n: What will be the minium modem speed?\nProbably 9600bps.\n\n: If you have run Quake with a 3d accelerator yet, what is the\n: performance improvement estimate?\nIt is great. I will get the exact specs from Michael in\nthe morning... something like 640x480 at 30+ fps.\n\n: About how many enemies/level?\nThis is not something we are going to release yet.\n\n: What do you plan to do to defend Quake against products like D!zone?\nKill. :) Not sure yet.\n\n: When 3D characters were used in games like fade to black and alone in\n: the dark, player control was compromised because the character could\n: not stop on a dime, if he was in the middle of a step, he would\n: complete his step first.  What is Quake's position on this?\nWe have always hated shit like that and we will not\nallow something that \"looks cool\" to destroy the overall\nfun of the game.\n\n: 1.  If I have a network setup between a couple of comps in my\n: apartment, can someone call in on my modem (with my comp as server)\n: and join in the mayhem?\nYes.\n\n: 2.  Are the levels gonna be interconnected... and if so, how would\n: this work in DM?  Say I wanted to pound somebody but I couldn't\n: find them.\nYes they are, but you will be able to specify whether\npeople can go to the next level or not. It will depend\na lot on the type of OS you are running. If the OS\nis multitasking and can run more than one server at a time\nthen when someone leaves a level it can either, take everyone\nwith that guy... or spawn a new server with that level on it\nthat would then run side by side with the current level.\nThis could obviously cause problems if everyone went to\ndifferent levels, but there will be ways to control how\nthis works.\n\n: 3.  Is the Hell Spawn Matrix Death Cube '95 (tm) still in there, or\n: is there going to be a similar object in the game?\nNot sure now.\n\n: 4.  Is voice going to be incorporated in games run over modem?\nIf the modem will support it. We are not going to try to\nget this into the code though.\n\n: 5.  Ponder this:  I've got a network of 8 comps... say the server is\n: a P-100 with 16 megs o ram running win95.... slow or fast net game?\nShould be ok.\n\n: 6.  On the day that Quake is released, is the Internet going to see\n: its biggest shutdown since RTM's worm?  If so, can I stop by Id's office to\n: copy the shareware version? :)\nHeh... what do you think? Crash bitch! Crash!\nYeah, we would *love* to see all our fans here at the office\ntrying to get copies of the game the day we release... I think\nthe building would crash :) Would not be so bad if all our fans\nwere gorgeous super models of course...\n\n: \tWill I be COOL if I play Quake?\nNo, you will be cool if you suck my... anyway.\n\n: 1) Dead bodies as armor (i.e. use your dead buddy as a shield from\n: bullets)?\nThis would be pretty funny... we will see.\n\n: 2) Multiple games with different configs (i.e running three quake server\n: on one one computer for the novice, the moderate, and the psychopath)?\nThis is working now.\n\n: 3) Can characters build shield/shelters from raw material objects in the\n: game (i.e. hold up box in front of chest to keep from getting blasted in\n: the chest)?\nNo.\n\n: b)Would modifying the source slow it down at all, or is it compiled BEFORE\n: runtime on the server?\nYou can modify the source while the game is running but the\nchanges will not take effect until the progs are reloaded... but\nthis is something that you can do on the fly. Basically you would\ntell the server to reload everything, the game would freeze, but\neveryone would stay connected... once the progs were reloaded\n(if there were no bugs in your code) things would continue with\nyour changes.\n\n: c)Can the anti-christianity stuff be kept to a minimum?\nWho says that is Jesus anyway?! That could just be Bob or something.\n\n: d)Will cross-platform netquake be possible with big endian and little endian\n: machines playing together?\nThis will not be a problem. We are already doing it.\n\n: Will it be easy(no c coding involved) to configure a large group DM\n: session so that players do not respawn?\nThis would be *very* easy, but you would have to know how to\nuse QuakeC, which is much like C.\nYou would take this code:\n\tif (!self.button1)\n\t\treturn;\n\tself.deadflag = DEAD_RESPAWNED;\n\t...\nand make it this:\n\tif (!self.button1)\n\t\treturn;\n\treturn;\n\tself.deadflag = DEAD_RESPAWNED;\n\t...\nHe would then never come back.\n\n: 1) I remeber hearing that you guys were designing a new protical for\n: games on the internet.  What's the status of this?\nCarmack is still working on this.\n\n: 2) Does the concept of a \"god person\" still apply?  Can a person change\n: the game play environment during an actuall net game?\nYes.\n\n: Will you be able to drop/hand-off weapons/items (that other players can\n: pick-up)?\nNot on purpose, but if your buddy buys it right next to you\nhe will drop all the shit he was carrying and then you\ncan pick it up. (or you could leave it for him so he\ncan come back and get it... nah, fuck him.)\n\n: By customizing my character's 'skin' with a wall texture, will I be able\n: to hide (in a chameleon like way) by just standing still against a like\n: wall (and then pop out and kill the f%&ker)?\nUh... yeah... I had not thought of that one. You guys suck.\nI can just see it now... a bunch of dorks running around the\nlevels in \"wall texture camo\" going \"Where is everybody?!\"\n\n: Please, oh please, can you give us to ability to eat a slain opponent,\n: thereby gaining health & maybe his magic power? (or just for fun)\nTrent already did some good bone crunch/gut rip sounds that we\nare planing to use just for this. Who cares if it helps your\nhealth or not... it will be fun to kill someone and then take\na bite out of their face for good measure. :)\n\n:Once \"Quake\" is ready for release, will you then announce a release date,\n:or will it just suddenly appear on an FTP site somewhere?\nHehe. This is a good question, but we are not sure yet.\nSomething like 1... 2... 3... release! Crash!\n\n: You mentioned \"involuntary leaving the ground\". Is it possible to knock\n: someone off a cliff with a hammer blow to the back, or (even more fun)\n: can you throw people? :-o\nYou will not be able to throw people, but all weapons\nwill impart some velocity to the \"victim\". If the weapon\nis strong enough it will make him leave the ground. (We\nhave managed to get dead bodies to fly up into supports\nacross the ceiling:)\n\n: Can you aim your weapon to a specific body part. Like aim for an\n: knights weapon arm. Or are you stuck with a top right to bottom left\n: swing (assuming close combat weapons)?\nThis is DeathMatch, if you spend that much time trying to hit\nsomewhere specific you will be dead.\n\n: If you can aim your attack is it possible to block an oppents attack by\n: swinging at it? (Clash sword against sword)\nThis will not be in there.\n\n: Assuming close combat weapons, will the length of the swing affect the\n: damage? Short swings low damage but quick recovery. Long swings slower\n: but deadly.\nNot going to happen.\n\n: Will the user interface be as customizable as the rest of the program?\nYes.\n\n: You said that characters show damage on specific body parts but will it\n: impair them? Would a wounded leg decrease running speed?\nWe are thinking about this, but we are not sure if we like the\nidea or not yet. We will try it out and if it is cool it will\nstay, if not it will end up in some other companies game.\n\n: 1) Does the framerate max out, and if so, what is the maximum?\nNot right now. Probably will not.\n\n: 2) Is there support for external 24-bit models / sprites?\nModels already are.\n\n: 3) What sound formats are supported (i.e. Qsound, ProLogic, etc.)\nAnything that someone wants to write support for.\n\n: 4) What is the minimum requirement / recommended system?\nUhg.\n\n: 5) Will there be a version of Quake optimized for the P6?\nFor the Pentium yes, P6 probably not.\n\n: 6) What will the primary distribution format be?\nNot sure yet.\n\n: 7) About how much disk space will Quake require (game, drivers, swapfiles)?\nShould not be much more than DOOM.\n\n: 8) Will specifications be released before the game so that editors and\n: other levels can be released concurrently?\nYES.\n\n: What 3D acceleration chipsets does ID like?  Which will y'all support?\nRight now the only thing we are playing with is the Rendition.\nThere will be others, but we cannot comment on this right now.\n\n:   You stated that you would make QuakEd available for Win95 and NexT.\n: What about us Linux users?  You were talking about how much you loved it\n: and everything, so I was hoping you could be persuaded to port it to\n: Linux too.\nIt would be cool to have a Linux version... but we do not have\ntime to do it. I am sure that once we release the source those\ncool Linux Gods out there will have an editor ready for you in\na matter of minutes.\n\n: 3. Can we add different death frames to the guys? (like a new type of\n: death.. e.g. die of poisoning)\nYou will be able to add new ones easily and there will be several\nin there when we ship the game.\n\n: 5. I can't wait to see the swimming.. can you drown?  (attach weights to\n: your opponents..)\nWe are still working on this. I do not think we will have drowning,\nbut there will be some cool things happening when you kill a person\nin the water. (bodies float to the surface etc...)\n\n: Also.. you've been letting all these comments about\n: Quake possibly having modern elements (like rockets) sorta slide..\n: not gonna  elaborate??\nHehe. Not going to elaborate. Nope.\n\n: Anyway, you mentioned that in Quake you WOULD be able to get\n: experience for killing other people. Does this mean that you could\n: just beat up on newbies all day and end up powerful enough to beat a\n: better player?\nNo, you get points based on the skill of the guy you\njust killed. Newbies would give you little or no points\ndepending on how the server was set up... and some servers\ncan be set up not to allow newbies or American-Like-God\nplayers on in order to keep things fair.\n\n: Several versions of DOOM were public betas.  Heretic had a public\n: beta.  Hexen had a public beta.  So why can't you release a Quake beta?\nWe are working on something.\n\n(I hope someone out there is keeping all of this in\nsome sort of FAQ so that I don't have to do this again\nanytime soon :)\nIf you sent a question and it does not get answered make\nsure that someone else did not ask a question that was\nsimilar... if you still do not find it that means that\nwe either are not talking about that or the question\nyou asked would have required some serious explanation\nthat I am not willing to get into here.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n\n********\nTHERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*!\nTHERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST EITHER.\nWE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.\n********\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nStatus of DOOM---Updated: Fri, Jul 28th 3:22pm\n\nWe have mastered The Ultimate DOOM! *This is out in stores now*.\nThere is a patch for registered DOOM owners that will turn your\nDOOM into Ultimate DOOM for free.

We saw an almost-final\nversion of Win95-DOOM a couple months ago, so it should be done by now.\n\nWINDOWS: There will be NO Windows 3.1 version of DOOM.\n\nOld news\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nSGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.\nIt is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.

I really want to answer all the\nquestions you people are sending... but there are\ntoo many. Since I started this thing I have recieved\nover 350+ pieces of mail... 10 more while I am writing\nthis! I cannot work on Quake and answer all these questions\nall day long. I know you guys want them answered so\nhere is what I am going to do... I will stop taking\nnew questions right now and finish answering the 160\npeices of mail I still have not gotten to. Once that\nis done I am going to have to call this off. Don't be\nmad... be happy. This means I can get back to work\non Quake and have it out on time. :)\n\nThe reason that Quake will not be released until Spring:\nWe are making sure that this will be the coolest game\nyou ever saw. Nothing more than that.\n\nThings that work:\nJust about everything.\n\nThings we are working on:\nSpeed, monsters, actual game play :), more\nweapons, figuring out some way to have all\nthe people who send us mail bugging us about\nQuake run over by a truck. Joystick code,\nitems, environmental hazards, etc...\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nNetwork Play:\nWe have DeathMatch! (This is really why we are delaying the\nrelease... we have been playing DM too much.)\nRight now we can start up a game with n players and\nrun around killing each other all day long. You\ncan leave the game, and then jump back in whenever\nyou like (as long as the server is still running.)\nDeathMatch right now is great, and it is going to\nget even better. We have found the replacement for\nDOOM DeathMatch... finally :)\n\nEngine:\nAll VESA resolutions are now in. Video hardware support\nis in and working for some cards now. This means that\nyou can run 640x480 at high frame rates. I mean *high*\ntoo. The engine is just about done. There is not much\nmissing from it now. Textures and modeling are rock solid.\nAt this point we are working on the game itself and the\nengine details... minor but important stuff.\n\nMap Editor:\nCarmack just rewrote the editor to allow us more\nflexibility while designing levels. This took some\ntime, but it was worth it. We are now able to\ndo things that were once impossible with the old\neditor.\n\nDone picking on Munchkin.\n\nPlease stop sending Quake questions.\nI cannot keep answering them... it is taking\nway too much time.\n-----------Quake Questions Answered------------------\n: will Quake still be medieval as planned?\nYes. The architecture will remain the same,\nbut we are planning on some new stuff. Not saying\nwhat yet though.\n\n: Also, Romero mentioned looking up and down was a lot\n: easier in Quake than it was in Heretic.\nYes, it will be. There will be more automatic looking\nup and down which means that you will not have to worry\nabout doing it yourself. This will not interfere with\ngameplay though.\n\n: I just bought a 3 button logitech mouse with the assumption\n: that it'd be a bit easier to handle Quake with 3 buttons.\n: Is this in any way true?\nAs far as mice go, this will be the way to do it. There\nmay be other controllers out there more suited to Quake\nby the time it comes out though. Right now we are all\nusing Logitech three button mice.\n\n: Romero stated that id would be unable to use the name Quake\n: since some German company copywrote it first. Any word on\n: the new name (assumadly you'll copywrite it before releasing\n: it this time).\nWe have a new name, but like you said, we cannot release\nit until we have it copyrighted.\n\n: Any major differences between Quake and DOOM deathmatch, besides\n: free coming and going from games?\nWell, these things could change... but right now when you\nkill someone who is carrying rockets he might explode and\ntake you with him:) Also, when you kill someone they dump\nall the ammo they were carrying. There are more, but we\nare not going to get into it right now.\n\n: Do you guys expect to get a fluid\n: game with a bunch of 28800 ppp people\nYes.\n\n: Also, will there be more dmatch \"modes\", such as team games\n: like capture the flag or team wars?\nYes, and it will be very easy for the person running the\nserver to program these games in if he/she wants to.\n\n: Also, since Quake will supposedly offer the ability to play with\n: many many people on one map, how will individuals be differentiated?\nYou will be able to use different \"skins\" so that you\ncould have a huge dragon on the front of your guy etc...\n\n: Any word on how servers will function?\nNot going into this right now.\n\n: On a minor, technological note, any realtime shadows yet?\nNo, this will probably be in our next game though.\n\n: Movable walls in any way?\nAlready in there.\n\n: What about monster AI, will it be slimmed down to near-doom\n: levels to up speed in other areas?\nMonster AI will be much cooler than DOOM AI. Already is.\n\n: Will tcp/ip support be built in?\nAlready is.\n\n: I have read that it will be possible to actually edit maps\n: while \"live action\" is taking place.\nThis will not be possible.\n\n: Along those lines, will it (can it?) be possible to\n: allow a person to directly control a monster (non-player\n: character) in the same manner one controls his/her hero?\nThis could be possible, but we are not going to include the\ncode to allow you to do this. It would be something you\nwould have to add in yourself. It would not be hard to\nadd though.\n\n: i want to be prepared, so what are the h/w requirements\n: for the Quake server?\nWe are not releasing these specs yet. They will not be\ntoo hard to take though.\n\n: What about the Mac version of Quake? When will it come out\n: and what differences will there be?\nThis will eventually happen, and the difference will be that\nit is on the Mac.\n\n: Also, any chance in hell I will be able to run smoothly over\n: the net on my puny little 14.4?\nYour modem would not be the problem here, it would be the net...\nbut you might be able to find a server with a small amount of\nlag that would be playable.\n\n: You mentioned joystick code, is the joystick going to be a plausible\n: way to control your character in Quake (unlike doom) with (I'm assuming)\n: variable sensitivity and analog support?\nThe joystick code will be cool. Better than in DOOM, and should be\na cool way to control looking up and down (with a hatstick).\n\n: Is there anything planned regarding 3D rendering card support?\nAs said above, we have this working and it is cool.\n\n: Can walls be damaged or destroyed during combat?\nNo.\n\n: Does Quake incorporate traps and puzzles to allow\n: allow unarmed players to overcome armed apponents\n: by using their wits and stealth?\nNo, there is no violence in that now is there?\n\n: How will close combat weapons be handled?\nAs simply as possible. Push the key. No more than that.\n\n: How does the character's speed/control compare to DOOM?\n: Will we still be able to mouse-flick 180 degrees and\n: strafe-run etc?\nHell yes. Do you really think that we would let the keyboard\nlamers play the same game as those who know the *right* way\nto play?!\n\n: Which video cards will you be enabling hardware support for?\nWe are speaking of the hardware accelerator boards here. You\nwill be able to use any card that someone bothers to write a\ndriver for. We are making sure that it is possible to write\nexternal drivers for things like this.\n\n: Are we still going to be able to play peer-to-peer deathmatch games?\nYes, you would just run the server on one of the machines\nthat you are using... that machine would act as client to\nitself.\n\n: Will it be possible to setup a \"Quake\" server in conjunction with a\n: multi-line bbs (even if the players have to access it thru slip on the\n: network).\nYes.\n\n: Can we expect a demo/screen shots in the next month or two? Atleast a\n: freakin animation!?\nNo answer on this.\n\n: WHats the current weapon count? What will the final count be?\nThree right now. We are not sure of the final count.\n\n: Have any new monsters been completed?\nYes. I would like to describe some of them, but that is\ninfo that we cannot release right now.\n\n: Has Into the Shadows had and effect on the release date?\nNo.\n\n: Can players be on multiple levels in dmatch? Like You and I (yeah right)\n: in level 1, and Jromero in 2?\nIf the OS that you are running the server under is something\nreal like Linux you will be able to do this.\n\n: 1. Is Trent still doing the sounds, or is that being redone too?\nYes, Trent is still doing the sounds. And doing a great job too.\n\n: 2. You mentioned rockets -- in a medieval setting ?\nHmmm... things could change you know.\n\n: Is the target hardware still 486 dx/2 66 w/ 8mb and non 3d card?\n: If so, at what res will it be running?\nIt does run on this, but you have to size the screen down a\nlittle bit. We are still working on getting the speed up,\neven though it is running very fast right now anyway.\n\n: Any price yet?\nNope.\n\n: Is it easy to modify your character so that you will look\n: different than the others in a deathmatch?\nYou would just give yourself a new skin texture. Should not\nbe too hard to do.\n\n: So what comes after Quake? Spooge....\nWait and see.\n\n: How many levels will the shareware be?\nSame as DOOM.\n\n: Will weapons be multipurpose (like Dark forces; hit an\n: alternate key and throw the hammer instead)?\nThis is possible.\n\n: Story so far?\nHahaha!\n\n: Character Demo? Hehehhehehehe\nNot yet, but we will send something out soon.\n\n: ARE YOU KEEPING THAT STUPID HAMMER,and THERE WILL be multiple\n: weapons a yes,no and a yes,no Is all I need\nWe are not saying about this right now.\n\n: Do you plan on releasing the map\n: editor/graphic/sound editors you used for the game?\nYes, we will be doing this.\n\n: Trent's going to be doing the FX, correct? I've read interviews\n: with romero that've said there will be no music, and there will\n: be trent's music. What's going on? :)\nTrent is doing the SFX for sure and we are trying to\nfigure out if we are going to be able to include a seperate\nsound track with the game (done by Trent).\n\n: Is id still planning on doing a Sony PlayStation version...and will\n: you consider supporting dial-up with that version?\nWe would like to but we cannot make any promises this early.\n\n: If one were planning on running a server and/or doing a load of editing,\n: would you recomend submerging one-self's in NeXTSTEP or LINUX to prepare?\nWell, the only OS you would want to run a *real* server on would\nneed to be under some multitasking OS like Linux or Next, but you\ncan run simple (single level, multiplayer) servers on a DOS box.\nAs far as the editors go... we will probably release the Next and\na WIN95 version of QuakeEd.\n\n: Will it be possible to swim in Quake?\nYes.\n\n: Will a multi-player game be possible using a single computer\n: playing split-screen, instead of needing a network?\nNo.\n\n: You mentioned peer to peer will work by having one machine act as\n: server and client. Will this give any advantage to either machine in\n: terms of performance?\nThe machine acting as client and server will suffer some, but\nnot a lot.\n\n: Will there be flying in Quake? If so, will it be controlled like\n: Heretic/Hexen (fly up/down) or like descent (fly where you point)?\nThere will be a lot of tossing and involuntary leaving the ground:)\nBut there probably won't be any sustained flying.\n\n: Will quake support/use math co-pros.\nNo.\n\n: Is the software required to run a server included in the game?   Will it be\n: present in the shareware version in one form or another?\nYes. Yes.\n\n: How is Quake looking in comparison to DN3D?  Is Apogee making you sweat as\n: much now as they did releasing Blake Stone on the eve of Doom's release?\nHahahah.\n\n: Are any of Trent's sound FX going to revolve around the \"piggy\" theme that\n: is so prevalent in his music?\nSo far they have not, but we will have to wait and see. We have\nnot put any restraints on him... the sfxs are his deal.\n\n: Will there be fog in Quake?\nNot in Quake. Next game.\n\n: Also, will it be possible to QUICKLY kill people (one shot in the back,\n: point blank)?  Will there be body part-specific damage?\nYes and yes.\n\n: would quake client/server run under win95? i mean, using winsock32 and\n: win95 based calls.\nYes.\n\n: if i can have 2 machines networked locally, which one should be running\n: quake server?\nThe faster machine.\n\n: would i be able to run quake server in win95?\nYes.\n\n: Will \"Quake\" have any moving light sources?\nNo. The engine is not set up for things like this.\n\n: Will Quake have full support for the Logitech Cyberman?\nYes, we will include the \"hammer driver\" with Quake so that\nyou can smash the shit out of your CyberMan and by a real controller.\n\n: Will you be able to tell what weapons / armour / artifacts a guy\n: is carrying (before he gets a chance to use them)?\nYes.\n\n: 1st - Will there still be \"voice support\" through the network.  i.e.\n: speaking through a mic and the people \"closest\" to you can hear\n: you while the people furtherst away might faintly hear you or not\n: hear you at all.\nThis will be in there soon.\n\n: 2nd - How will the support be with the VFX1 virtual reality helmet?\nIt will be great. Don't worry.\n\n: 3rd - Can damage be inflicted to certain areas of the body  i.e. if I\n: hit someone in the left shoulder, will they be knocked back in that\n: area?  Will they bleed from that area?\nYes, they will show the damage in the area where you hit them.\n\n: 1.)  Will Quake support 16bit or 24bit color modes?\n16bit under DOS and you can get 24bit under other OSs.\n\n: 2.)  Will Quake be a native Win95 app?\nThere will be a version of this, yes.\n\n: What Operating System will Quake come out for first?\n: DOS? Win95?(Not that Win95 is an OS) Linux?\nDOS, Linux, WIN95, NeXT, IRIX, and maybe more.\n\n: What Operating System will the server Software run under?\n: Unix? Linux? Sun?\nAll of the above.\n\n: What special fees will be involved in running a Quake Server?\nWe have not decided on how this will work yet.\n\n: I read somewhere that all level editing/creating would be done\n: through text (indicating object, coordinates, texture, etc.) to\n: make it easier for people to create level editors. Is this true?\nLevel editing is done in a CAD-like program that we created,\ncalled QuakeEd. When creating objects in the world that you\ninteract with though, you program these in QuakeC.\n\n: Could you tell us a little bit more about how the\n: character animations are done?\nKevin Cloud created monsters/characters with Alias and\nthen animates them and generates frames. The frames are\nthen played back in the QuakeC code whenever the character\nattacks/moves etc...\n\n:  In \"quake\", will the water be maybe deeper, and to make it more\n: realistic, will walking/wading through water slow you down?\nYou will be able to go underwater in Quake.\n\n: Will ammunition be a light source (e.g. fire a rocket and it lights up\n: the corridor as it flies)?\nNo.\n\n: Will there be support for I-glasses and other *TRUE*\n: stereoscopic headsets?\nYes.\n\n: Just out of curiosity...Has id thought about setting up it's own quake\n: network (national, or, in any case, big and public)?\nWe are thinking about this.\n\n: How will the differentiating of other quake players in deathmatch\n: be incorporated? Will we have a charatcer editor for the DM?\nThey will be different colors, or they will have a new skin.\nYou can edit the skins with any paint program that will load\n.lbms.\n\n: 2) Will the DOS version run faster than the Linux version,\n: or vice versa?\nThey will be about the same.\n\n: I herd a rummor that Quake would be ported to Linux like\n: Doom was.  Is there any plans for this or possible plans?\nYes. We love Linux and there will be a Quake version for it.\nWe are hoping that people will realize that Linux is the\nway to go if they want to set up a proper Quake server\nmachine.\n\n: Question 1) Will it be possible to cause environmental damage, such as\n: taking out entire walls in a firefight?\nNo.\n\n: Question 2) Is it possible to dismember enemies?  ie, if I don't like\n: someone's head (or other portion of their physionomy) can I cut it off?\nYes.\n\n: Will \"quake\" be a doom-like slugfest or will you ( and them) be harder to\n: kill then just one blast?\nCome on. Do you want to *wait* to kill someone by pounding on\nthem with a stick for a while... or do you want to shove a\nshotgun under their chin and watch their brains hit the ceiling?!\nSlugfest.\n\n:    Will there be outdoor landscapes that are really spread out\n: like a huge grass area or forest or some kind of terrain, or is it mostly\n: within the castle sorta thing?\nMostly indoors.\n\n: ah yes, i almost forgot.. will quake use wads of some sort? or will\n: everything be in an external file?\nSounds and qc files will be external. Maps and textures will be in\nwads, although we are not calling them that now:)\n\n: Can you move, pile up, or stand on top of dead bodies? Heheheh\n: (alt.games.quake)\nYes, these things are already in there and quite funny.\n\n: How long do we have to wait for the editor to be released?\nUntil the game is released.\n\n: Can we leave markings on walls (bullet holes)?\nNo.\n\n: You keep mentioning \"next game\" for new features...does this\n: mean Quake II or a different series?\nThis means the next game engine after Quake.\n\n: On the experience part I just wanted to add that it would be nice to be\n: able to save a character and play with him throughout the gamer's\n: QUAKE experience.\nThis is something that we intend to have in there. It will\nbe very cool when playing with persistent servers.\n\n: 1)\tWill there be a shareware release? and when?\nYes. When it is finished.\n\n: 2)\tWhat actions can be performed? eg: Running, climbing, rolling,\n: crouching, jumping, leaning etc.\nRight now there is jumping and leaning... there will be\nclimbing (maybe).\n\n: 3)\tI know that heads can be cut off, what about arms, legs, torso's etc.\nDepends on the creature you are attacking. Basically you cannot\ndo this all the time to all creatures (too many frames) but\nwe are going to make sure you can do this sometimes.\n\n: 4)\tAre you guys still supporting the Verite Rendition card? What about\n: Lockheed & Martin's Cards.\nWe are supporting the Rendition card. All others cards will be\nable to be added later by others.\n\n: 5)\tWill there be Day and Night? Weather effects?\nProbably not... but we will see.\n\n: 6)\tStill able to sacrifice to the Daemons???\nOf course.\n\n: 7)\tHow much interaction with the environment will there be?? like moving\n: boxes, smashing things, leaving marks on the environment (burn marks from a\n: spell say for instance)\nWe are not sure yet... depends on how much we think it adds\nto the actual gameplay once it is in... these things sometimes\nlook cool the first time but then get to be old after a while.\n\n: 8)\tAre your 3D polygon character models as detailed as the models in\n: Triton's Into the Shadows? (The guys hair and tunic moves!! V-cool!)\nThey are pretty detailed. ITS and Quake are two totally different\ntypes of games though... it is not fair to either product to make\nthese comparisons.\n\n: 9)\tI know you've said there will be no shadows from the characters, but\n: come on, if Into the Shadows can manage Multiple shadows, Why not Quake???\n: What specifically is stopping you from implementing them. Without them the\n: characters dont look like they belong in the scene if ya know what I mean?!\nSee above.\n\n: this is prolly a stupid question, but will I be able to play quake\n: over a regular modem with a friend, without a server/client deal?\nI will do some explaining for those of you who do understand how\nthis is going to work. The client is the machine that you will\nbe playing the game on. It is the machine that all the graphics\nget drawn by, and all your input goes into. The server is the\nmachine that takes care of all the difficult computations\nneeded in order to create realistic environments like the ones\nin Quake. When running Quake on one PC you are actually running\nboth the client and the server on the same machine. There are\na few different combinations that Quake will allow when it comes\nto this though... you could 1) play single player with the client\non one machine and the server on another. 2) play multiplayer with\nthe clients on different machines all over the place and the server\non a separate machine or 3) play multiplayer with the server running\non one of the machines that is also being used as a client. In\neffect, one of the guys is going to use his machine as the server\nfor everyone else (including himself) and the client for himself.\nSo... in your situation you could do this two ways: 1) you could\nset up the server for the game and your client on your machine\nand have your friend call you or 2) you guys could set up a separate\nmachine with two modems in it and you both call it to play. (there\nare other combinations but I think you get the idea.) Whew... lot's\nof text and I bet that made no sense at all :)\n\n: 1.In previous DOOM DOOM2 etc. each computer had to have a copy of the\n: wad(pwad) file to play a homebrew level(s). Will it be possible in\n: Quake to Xfer levels between computers or at least from the server\n: to play a game? This would be a welcome feature for playing over the\n: net and also LANs.\nWe are working on a way to include all the sounds/gfx in the\nwad file so that each wad file contains it's own gfx palette\nand sounds... this way you have one file that contains everything\nand you could potentially transfer this file to a server. This code\nis not in there yet, and we may not put it in there ourselves,\nbut it would not be hard to add.\n\n: 2.Will their be some sort of a licence site (for a LAN) / package?\nThere will be, but we are not sure about how it is going to work\nyet.\n\n: Are you going to create a dynamic outdoor setting, too?\nThe game is better suited to cool indoor areas, but you could\ndo outside areas also. We are thinking in terms of levels\nthat everyone out there can play, and so we are trying to\nmake sure that the levels we create have a good balance\nof coolness/speed. There should be some nice outdoor areas\nin Quake.\n\n: Okay, you may not want to release direct info on the server hardware\n: requierements right now, but i am wondering how many users will a Server\n: running on a Pentium 120 (with enough mem) will be able to support? (A\n: rough number at least)\nWe honestly do not know yet. We have been running some servers\non a P90 and we have hooked in around 9 clients without any slow\ndown at all. The max number is not really known yet... but I think\nit will be pretty high.\n\n: Also, assuming people are playing on a server via 28.8K modems, how many\n: users can there be in the game before the game strts getting slugish?\nAgain, we do not know about this. Modem code is not finished\nyet and we have not set up a machine with a ton of modems in\nit yet to test this. It will be pretty high though.\n\n: First, I assume the Quake version for win95 will incorperate directdraw,\n: and all those neat goodies. Will it run faster on a win95 platform as\n: opposed to DOS or LINUX?\nIt will be about the same speed.\n\n: Will it be possible to kill enemies, gain experience for that, and thus\n: grow in power and hp's?\nThis is something that will be possible in DeathMatch, but we\nare not thinking about doing in the actual game. We will\nsee.\n\n: What controller would you recommend when this comes out?\nRight now we are all using Logitech three button mice, but\nsomething cooler might come along before we release.\n\n: How much longer after the DOS release will the Win95 release be?\nThey should come out about the same time. The DOS version we have\nnow will run fine under WIN95 though.\n\n: Will it be possible to hide in the shadows of a corner and thus jump\n: an enemy from behind and crush his skull in?\nYes.\n\n: Is this going to be a CD-ROM game, and if so what kind of speed would\n: you be looking at?\nNope. CD-ROM does not == action.\n\n: Will it be possible to record a game ie: doom lmp's?\nYes.\n\n: Will Quake support the Microsoft Sidewinder Pro, especially the swivel\n: feature?\nFor those of you asking if we are going to support x or y please\nunderstand something: We are writing Quake in such a way that\nwhen we release it the manufactures of these products will be\nable to quickly and easily add support for their products. Chances\nare that many of the cool people out on the net will be writing\nmost of the device drivers for all the cool add ons you want.\n\n: The thing that facinates me about quake is its 3D aspect.  Will you provide\n: true floor over floor design and will the outside environment be realistic?\nFloor over floor is already in there. Has been since the beginning.\nOutsides will be cool.\n\n: What color depth will Quake run in?\nRight now the only depth we are sure of is 8bit. It may ship\nwith the ability to run 8, 16, 24... but we are not sure.\nIt does not matter because the only thing that looks better\nthan 8bit is 24bit, and it is not that big of a difference.\n(This is all under DOS) If you are running under Next you\ncan get 24bit and Linux can get 8 or 16bit.\n\n: I would like to know just how much freedom will quakeC give me.\n: Will it be like a suped dehacked, where all I can do is make new\n: levels monsters and weapons.\nIn QuakeC you will have control over all objects in the world\nsuch as doors, players, weapons, monsters, items etc... This means\nyou could totally reprogram any one of these things from scratch\nor just make minor modifications if you wanted to. You could\nalso turn Quake into a new game with some modifications to\nthe QuakeC and with some changes in the actual C code. (We are\ngoing to release as much of this as we can).\n\n: you mention that QuakeEd will be released w/\n: Quake but for creating objects that you interact with\n: you will need to program in QuakeC.  Will you then\n: also release a QuakeC compiler?\nAll you need to edit QuakeC is a text editor. The QuakeC will\ngo out with the game in the same form that we are working on\nit here. The compiler is built into the game and compiles the\ncode every time you run the game.\n\n: If you w/ a fast puter and somebody w/ a slow puter\n: are loged into the same Quake server, will you be able\n: to run/shoot faster than him?\nThe guy with the fast computer will have a higher frame rate\nand he will get more updates to the server than the other guy...\nin effect he will have an advantage, but on the other hand if\na dork with a slow computer joins a game where everyone is playing\nwith extremely fast systems and connects he will not cause everyone\nelse to slow down.\n\n: 1.) will quake be so advanced that other software companies will\n: not be able to claim that their game is \"like-quake, only better\"\n: or will the engine be easily cloned within a year after the\n: initial release?\nI refuse to answer these types of questions on the grounds that\nI want to say something like \"Quake will smash the shit out of\nall other games... and other game companies pee on themselves.\"\nIf I say things like that I get flamed by other game companies...\nand besides, it's not \"professional\" :)\n\n: 2.) will the quake engine be licensed for other games?\n: possibly a DOOM 3?\nOf course.\n\n: 3.) do you guys realize how freaking anxious all of us are for\n: the release?\nUh, no. Really? I've only gotten 200+ pieces of mail in the\nlast 12 hours!\n\n: How will the auto-mapping be handled?\nThere probably will be no automap.\n\n: How will lmp recording be handled? The same as Doom or from room\n: cameras or something different?\nSame as in DOOM, although it would not be hard to get cameras\nin there.\n\n: Will there a weapon that is as satisfying as\n: the Doom shotgun/super shotgun..\n:) Wait and see.\n\n: What will be the minium modem speed?\nProbably 9600bps.\n\n: If you have run Quake with a 3d accelerator yet, what is the\n: performance improvement estimate?\nIt is great. I will get the exact specs from Michael in\nthe morning... something like 640x480 at 30+ fps.\n\n: About how many enemies/level?\nThis is not something we are going to release yet.\n\n: What do you plan to do to defend Quake against products like D!zone?\nKill. :) Not sure yet.\n\n: When 3D characters were used in games like fade to black and alone in\n: the dark, player control was compromised because the character could\n: not stop on a dime, if he was in the middle of a step, he would\n: complete his step first.  What is Quake's position on this?\nWe have always hated shit like that and we will not\nallow something that \"looks cool\" to destroy the overall\nfun of the game.\n\n: 1.  If I have a network setup between a couple of comps in my\n: apartment, can someone call in on my modem (with my comp as server)\n: and join in the mayhem?\nYes.\n\n: 2.  Are the levels gonna be interconnected... and if so, how would\n: this work in DM?  Say I wanted to pound somebody but I couldn't\n: find them.\nYes they are, but you will be able to specify whether\npeople can go to the next level or not. It will depend\na lot on the type of OS you are running. If the OS\nis multitasking and can run more than one server at a time\nthen when someone leaves a level it can either, take everyone\nwith that guy... or spawn a new server with that level on it\nthat would then run side by side with the current level.\nThis could obviously cause problems if everyone went to\ndifferent levels, but there will be ways to control how\nthis works.\n\n: 3.  Is the Hell Spawn Matrix Death Cube '95 (tm) still in there, or\n: is there going to be a similar object in the game?\nNot sure now.\n\n: 4.  Is voice going to be incorporated in games run over modem?\nIf the modem will support it. We are not going to try to\nget this into the code though.\n\n: 5.  Ponder this:  I've got a network of 8 comps... say the server is\n: a P-100 with 16 megs o ram running win95.... slow or fast net game?\nShould be ok.\n\n: 6.  On the day that Quake is released, is the Internet going to see\n: its biggest shutdown since RTM's worm?  If so, can I stop by Id's office to\n: copy the shareware version? :)\nHeh... what do you think? Crash bitch! Crash!\nYeah, we would *love* to see all our fans here at the office\ntrying to get copies of the game the day we release... I think\nthe building would crash :) Would not be so bad if all our fans\nwere gorgeous super models of course...\n\n: \tWill I be COOL if I play Quake?\nNo, you will be cool if you suck my... anyway.\n\n: 1) Dead bodies as armor (i.e. use your dead buddy as a shield from\n: bullets)?\nThis would be pretty funny... we will see.\n\n: 2) Multiple games with different configs (i.e running three quake server\n: on one one computer for the novice, the moderate, and the psychopath)?\nThis is working now.\n\n: 3) Can characters build shield/shelters from raw material objects in the\n: game (i.e. hold up box in front of chest to keep from getting blasted in\n: the chest)?\nNo.\n\n: b)Would modifying the source slow it down at all, or is it compiled BEFORE\n: runtime on the server?\nYou can modify the source while the game is running but the\nchanges will not take effect until the progs are reloaded... but\nthis is something that you can do on the fly. Basically you would\ntell the server to reload everything, the game would freeze, but\neveryone would stay connected... once the progs were reloaded\n(if there were no bugs in your code) things would continue with\nyour changes.\n\n: c)Can the anti-christianity stuff be kept to a minimum?\nWho says that is Jesus anyway?! That could just be Bob or something.\n\n: d)Will cross-platform netquake be possible with big endian and little endian\n: machines playing together?\nThis will not be a problem. We are already doing it.\n\n: Will it be easy(no c coding involved) to configure a large group DM\n: session so that players do not respawn?\nThis would be *very* easy, but you would have to know how to\nuse QuakeC, which is much like C.\nYou would take this code:\n\tif (!self.button1)\n\t\treturn;\n\tself.deadflag = DEAD_RESPAWNED;\n\t...\nand make it this:\n\tif (!self.button1)\n\t\treturn;\n\treturn;\n\tself.deadflag = DEAD_RESPAWNED;\n\t...\nHe would then never come back.\n\n: 1) I remeber hearing that you guys were designing a new protical for\n: games on the internet.  What's the status of this?\nCarmack is still working on this.\n\n: 2) Does the concept of a \"god person\" still apply?  Can a person change\n: the game play environment during an actuall net game?\nYes.\n\n: Will you be able to drop/hand-off weapons/items (that other players can\n: pick-up)?\nNot on purpose, but if your buddy buys it right next to you\nhe will drop all the shit he was carrying and then you\ncan pick it up. (or you could leave it for him so he\ncan come back and get it... nah, fuck him.)\n\n: By customizing my character's 'skin' with a wall texture, will I be able\n: to hide (in a chameleon like way) by just standing still against a like\n: wall (and then pop out and kill the f%&ker)?\nUh... yeah... I had not thought of that one. You guys suck.\nI can just see it now... a bunch of dorks running around the\nlevels in \"wall texture camo\" going \"Where is everybody?!\"\n\n: Please, oh please, can you give us to ability to eat a slain opponent,\n: thereby gaining health & maybe his magic power? (or just for fun)\nTrent already did some good bone crunch/gut rip sounds that we\nare planing to use just for this. Who cares if it helps your\nhealth or not... it will be fun to kill someone and then take\na bite out of their face for good measure. :)\n\n:Once \"Quake\" is ready for release, will you then announce a release date,\n:or will it just suddenly appear on an FTP site somewhere?\nHehe. This is a good question, but we are not sure yet.\nSomething like 1... 2... 3... release! Crash!\n\n: You mentioned \"involuntary leaving the ground\". Is it possible to knock\n: someone off a cliff with a hammer blow to the back, or (even more fun)\n: can you throw people? :-o\nYou will not be able to throw people, but all weapons\nwill impart some velocity to the \"victim\". If the weapon\nis strong enough it will make him leave the ground. (We\nhave managed to get dead bodies to fly up into supports\nacross the ceiling:)\n\n: Can you aim your weapon to a specific body part. Like aim for an\n: knights weapon arm. Or are you stuck with a top right to bottom left\n: swing (assuming close combat weapons)?\nThis is DeathMatch, if you spend that much time trying to hit\nsomewhere specific you will be dead.\n\n: If you can aim your attack is it possible to block an oppents attack by\n: swinging at it? (Clash sword against sword)\nThis will not be in there.\n\n: Assuming close combat weapons, will the length of the swing affect the\n: damage? Short swings low damage but quick recovery. Long swings slower\n: but deadly.\nNot going to happen.\n\n: Will the user interface be as customizable as the rest of the program?\nYes.\n\n: You said that characters show damage on specific body parts but will it\n: impair them? Would a wounded leg decrease running speed?\nWe are thinking about this, but we are not sure if we like the\nidea or not yet. We will try it out and if it is cool it will\nstay, if not it will end up in some other companies game.\n\n: 1) Does the framerate max out, and if so, what is the maximum?\nNot right now. Probably will not.\n\n: 2) Is there support for external 24-bit models / sprites?\nModels already are.\n\n: 3) What sound formats are supported (i.e. Qsound, ProLogic, etc.)\nAnything that someone wants to write support for.\n\n: 4) What is the minimum requirement / recommended system?\nUhg.\n\n: 5) Will there be a version of Quake optimized for the P6?\nFor the Pentium yes, P6 probably not.\n\n: 6) What will the primary distribution format be?\nNot sure yet.\n\n: 7) About how much disk space will Quake require (game, drivers, swapfiles)?\nShould not be much more than DOOM.\n\n: 8) Will specifications be released before the game so that editors and\n: other levels can be released concurrently?\nYES.\n\n: What 3D acceleration chipsets does ID like?  Which will y'all support?\nRight now the only thing we are playing with is the Rendition.\nThere will be others, but we cannot comment on this right now.\n\n:   You stated that you would make QuakEd available for Win95 and NexT.\n: What about us Linux users?  You were talking about how much you loved it\n: and everything, so I was hoping you could be persuaded to port it to\n: Linux too.\nIt would be cool to have a Linux version... but we do not have\ntime to do it. I am sure that once we release the source those\ncool Linux Gods out there will have an editor ready for you in\na matter of minutes.\n\n: 3. Can we add different death frames to the guys? (like a new type of\n: death.. e.g. die of poisoning)\nYou will be able to add new ones easily and there will be several\nin there when we ship the game.\n\n: 5. I can't wait to see the swimming.. can you drown?  (attach weights to\n: your opponents..<evil grin>)\nWe are still working on this. I do not think we will have drowning,\nbut there will be some cool things happening when you kill a person\nin the water. (bodies float to the surface etc...)\n\n: Also.. you've been letting all these comments about\n: Quake possibly having modern elements (like rockets) sorta slide..\n: not gonna  elaborate??\nHehe. Not going to elaborate. Nope.\n\n: Anyway, you mentioned that in Quake you WOULD be able to get\n: experience for killing other people. Does this mean that you could\n: just beat up on newbies all day and end up powerful enough to beat a\n: better player?\nNo, you get points based on the skill of the guy you\njust killed. Newbies would give you little or no points\ndepending on how the server was set up... and some servers\ncan be set up not to allow newbies or American-Like-God\nplayers on in order to keep things fair.\n\n: Several versions of DOOM were public betas.  Heretic had a public\n: beta.  Hexen had a public beta.  So why can't you release a Quake beta?\nWe are working on something.\n\n: If I understand well, only the guy in control of the game server would be\n: able to change the game on the fly i.e. change player characteristics, new\n: weapons, new artifacts...?\n: Isn't that unfair to those players who are connected as clients and have no\n: control over the game whatsoever? Or am I wrong ? (as usual ;-)\nYes, this could be unfair if the guy you are playing with is\na cheating monkey... but we are working on a way of flaging\na server that has been messed with. So you should be able to\ntell if your \"buddy\" is cheating or not.\n\n: \" This means that you can run 640x480 at high frame rates.\"\n: Does this apply to all decent video cards, or only those with 3d\n: accelerators?\nAccelerators only.\n\n: \"1) play single player with the client\n: on one machine and the server on another.\"\n: Would this increase game speed in anyway?\nIn most cases it would only increase the speed a little.\n\n: Plain and simple can we expect anything for christmas, I don't care what\n: just something to look at; screen shots, animation, picture of your mom :)\nI will post a picture of my mom for you guy on Christmas :) No, I will\ntry to make sure that you guys get some sort of Christmas present.\nThis DOES NOT mean we are going to release the game or anything,\nbut maybe some new screenshots/info/something.\n\n:   : I have read that it will be possible to actually edit maps\n:   : while \"live action\" is taking place.\n:   This will not be possible.\n:   : 2) Does the concept of a \"god person\" still apply?  Can a person\n:   : change the game play environment during an actuall net game?\n:   Yes.\nThis did not make sense to some of you. What this means is that\nyou cannot change the level itself, but if you were a God person\nyou could have control over what was going on in a level. You\ncould spawn a monster behind a guy, make people freeze in place\nso that everyone else can beat on them etc... pretty much any\n\"God Tool\" that you can imagine could be created and used on the\npeople on your server... but you cannot make a new wall appear or\nanything that deals with changing the physical structure of a level.\n\n:   Lastly, will there be any OS/2 support.  You mentioned a few times that\n: a server required a \"real\" OS for multiple levels.  Have you tested any\n: code under OS/2?\nWe have not tested any code under OS/2, but I am sure someone out\nthere will create a port for us once the game is out.\n\n: How exactly does the aiming work in quake?\nJust like it did in DOOM. Point and click. Instant blood.\n\n: Is there an invisibility sphere, beserk box etc as from Doom?\nNo, we have not put anything like these two items in, but\nwe are working on new items that should replace them.\n\n: Someone asked if you could make\n: barriers and you said no, but you could make a fort with dead bodies\n: couldn't you?\nNo, because there is no way to move dead bodies around other than\nshooting them. There is no way to make them stack.\n\n: On skin textures, couldn't you just make your skin transparent or is this\n: somehow disabled?\nYou could not make your skin transparent because we do not have\na transparent color available to those polys.\n\n: Do you guys have any hardware plans, it was mentioned some time ago that\n: you might be making headsets, is that still in the works, are you guys\n: working on releasing a real controller for us?\nWe are not working on any hardware right now. If we do anything it will\nbe to find a nice controller that we are all using and put some\nkind of id stamp on it.\n\n: Will all player characters essentially be the same, or will there be\n: different types as in Hexen?\nThe same.\n\n: I loved the fact that you could drink the blood in Wolf3d when you were\n: under 10% health, will there be any sort of pools of blood around dead\n: bodies in which you could do the same in Quake?  Or will there be any\n: other vampiric elements in it?\nI am working on some vampiric weapons right now. We will see how they\nwork out.\n\n:  o  Ok, I saw that you did not have plans to port QuakeEd for Linux.\n: Oh man, that hoortz like you can't imagine.\nCome on... once we release the source code the Linux community will\nhave this huge race to see who can get the coolest/fastest\neditor out there. Don't worry about this.\n\n:  I know you're using Alias to build\n: your models but how will we define our *own* 3D objects?\nWell, you could either use Alias, or use some other 3D editor\nand then use a converter to make the model data what it needs to\nbe.\n\n: I have heard that due to a Limitation of BSP builders, the view will not be\n: able to \"tilt\".  That is, tilt from side to side, or rotate.\nWe have tilt working.\n\n: Ok, so the server has been hosting a deathmatch for 2 days straight, with\n: players coming and going. Thousands of body parts are piling up.\n: ...Things are looking a little cluttered.\nBodies enter a queue just like in DOOM. After there are a certain\nnumber of them on the level they will start to decompose and\nthen finally dissapear.\n\n: 1) Has the 'Quake' engine been optimised (sorry - I'm British) optimized for\n: Pentium processors ?\nYes.\n\n: Would ID consider producing a virtual world - something like\n: the virtual world in 'Snow Crash' - with virtual towns, roads, bars, clubs,\n: bikes, cars etc etc etc ?\nWe are not going to do this, but YOU could easily set your server\nup like this. This would be a sort of virtual MUD. People could\ncome on, look around, talk to each other. They could submit an\napplication for a room and you could tack one on for them in\nthe editor and then reload the server when there are not many\npeople on. Stuff like that. I am making sure that everything you\nwould need in order to do this will be included in the game.\n\n: 3) Do you get christmas off ?\nWhat's Christmas?\n\n: You say you eventually will support the mac. How eventually (third party\n: 2 years after the initial release kind of support?)\n: If you support it, what about quickdraw 3d acceleration?\nWe know the MacDOOM stuff took a long time. We will try to make\nsure the same thing does not happen with MacQuake. Not sure what\nthey are going to utilize in order to make it happen.\n\n:      I understand you will be doing the Sony Playstation version\n:      yourselves\n:      - will this be a cool as the PC version?\nWell, no. But it will be worth playing.\n\n:      - will deathmatch play be possible?\nYes.\n\n:      - will it be released within a reasonable time of the PC version or\nHopefully.\n\n: Linux is repeatedly mentioned as the server platform of choice for a\n: PC owner with a couple of friends to kill. If there's going to be a\n: CD version of Quake, what about putting a standard Linux distribution\n: (Slackware, Red Hat, Debian, whatever) on it?\nWe are thinking about this.\n\n: Also, you said that it would be possible to write the QuakeC code\n: to have a player be one of the baddies.  Will it be possible to\n: edit a DeathMatch code to where everybody is playing an entirely\n: different creature?\nYou could do this.\n\n: Will future versions of your software support anything other than\n: IPX networks (ie. Internet TCP/IP) for multiplayer games or will\n: be forever be stuck with third-party products like Kali?\nWe already have Quake running with TCP/IP and IPX.\n\n: have you seen the Into the Shadows demo of the 4 polygon-texture-mapped\n: characters and how does it compare to Quake?\nStop sending us shit about ITS. Yes, we have seen the demo, yes it was\ncool, no we don't give a shit about it. Quake will rule. There\nis no comparison between these two games. Besides, no one has even\nseen anything more than the ITS demo, and there is no telling what\nthe actual game will be like. The same goes for Quake. Let's start\ncomparing them when they are out.\n\n: You mentioned there would be no realtime shadows in quake: does that mean\n: the ones in the screenshots you released are pre-rendered? Doesn't that\n: take a whole bunch of space?\nNo, we mean that there will be no *moving* shadows. Everything you\nsee in the screenshots came directly from our screens to yours.\n\n\nI am answering the last questions in my mailbox and then that\nis it. Any new mail that I get today I am going to start deleting.\nI know I said I would do this until Friday, but I have gotten\nvery little done in the last few days except for answering all\nthese questions. Please understand that I would like to keep\nanswering all of these, but I just can't. Thanks.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n\n********\nTHERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*!\nTHERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST EITHER.\nWE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.\n********\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nStatus of DOOM---Updated: Fri, Jul 28th 3:22pm\n\nWe have mastered The Ultimate DOOM! *This is out in stores now*.\nThere is a patch for registered DOOM owners that will turn your\nDOOM into Ultimate DOOM for free.

I really want to answer all the\nquestions you people are sending... but there are\ntoo many. Since I started this thing I have recieved\nover 350+ pieces of mail... 10 more while I am writing\nthis! I cannot work on Quake and answer all these questions\nall day long. I know you guys want them answered so\nhere is what I am going to do... I will stop taking\nnew questions right now and finish answering the 160\npeices of mail I still have not gotten to. Once that\nis done I am going to have to call this off. Don't be\nmad... be happy. This means I can get back to work\non Quake and have it out on time. :)\n\nThe reason that Quake will not be released until Spring:\nWe are making sure that this will be the coolest game\nyou ever saw. Nothing more than that.\n\nThings that work:\nJust about everything.\n\nThings we are working on:\nSpeed, monsters, actual game play :), more\nweapons, figuring out some way to have all\nthe people who send us mail bugging us about\nQuake run over by a truck. Joystick code,\nitems, environmental hazards, etc...\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nNetwork Play:\nWe have DeathMatch! (This is really why we are delaying the\nrelease... we have been playing DM too much.)\nRight now we can start up a game with n players and\nrun around killing each other all day long. You\ncan leave the game, and then jump back in whenever\nyou like (as long as the server is still running.)\nDeathMatch right now is great, and it is going to\nget even better. We have found the replacement for\nDOOM DeathMatch... finally :)\n\nEngine:\nAll VESA resolutions are now in. Video hardware support\nis in and working for some cards now. This means that\nyou can run 640x480 at high frame rates. I mean *high*\ntoo. The engine is just about done. There is not much\nmissing from it now. Textures and modeling are rock solid.\nAt this point we are working on the game itself and the\nengine details... minor but important stuff.\n\nMap Editor:\nCarmack just rewrote the editor to allow us more\nflexibility while designing levels. This took some\ntime, but it was worth it. We are now able to\ndo things that were once impossible with the old\neditor.\n\nDone picking on Munchkin.\n\nPlease stop sending Quake questions.\nI cannot keep answering them... it is taking\nway too much time. I know I said I would do\nthis until Friday... but there is no way I can\nkeep this up. Please accept my apologies.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n\n********\nTHERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*!\nTHERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST EITHER.\nWE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.\n********\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nStatus of DOOM---Updated: Fri, Jul 28th 3:22pm\n\nWe have mastered The Ultimate DOOM! *This is out in stores now*.\nThere is a patch for registered DOOM owners that will turn your\nDOOM into Ultimate DOOM for free.

I've\nbeen having some fun with networking and AI, and we're getting tons of new art,\nmodels, and interface screens in every day.  One of these days we need to snap\nsome shots specifically of the UI -- its gorgeous.  And the new skies for the\nmodern day levels will floor you, trust me.  We were driving to go see \"The 13th\nWarrior\" tonight, and when I saw the full moon out, I couldn't help thinking, \n\"Ours looks better than that\"...\n\nI've also been working a bit on the side on a presentation I'm doing for the\nGame Developer's mini-conference in LA next month.  When I signed on for this\nit seems like years away, and now its like exactly one month from today, so \nas usual I'm cramming.  It should be interesting though, I'll be talking about\nthe entire life-cycle of our character modeling system.  Character modeling\nsystems aren't particularly unique or anything -- every game has one -- but I\nthought it would be interesting to talk about the different phases ours went\nthrough and how it constantly got improved and morphed along the way.  For \nexample, we started with a real basic closed-mesh system like we used in Jedi\nKnight, because it was what I was familiar with in the past.  Well, after about\n1 day of that the artists the ability to do proper soft-skin meshes, so we \nadded that.  Then we heard from some friends that Requiem was doing WEIGHTED\nsoft-skin meshes, so after playing with the math a bit, we added that, too.\nAnd so it went, feature by feature, until now we've got this huge thing with\ncontinuous automatic LOD, shadow volume rendering, material shaders, skeleton-\nattachments, etc.  Its interesting to take a step back and see how lots of \ntiny, incremental improvements got us from where we started over a year ago\nto where we're at today.  Hopefully other people will find it interesting, too.\n\nThe title of the talk is \"Breathing life into the undead\" or something like \nthat.  Hopefully anyone who's down in LA will have time to come check it out,\nits always fun to hear other people's ideas on this stuff.  Most times I start\nto talk shop with other programmers I end up getting a few new cool ideas.  The\nLA show is in Orange County (but they still call it LA) on September 27th.\nI'm also planning to give the same talk right here on our home turf at the \nMarin (San Francisco) conference later this year (like December-ish).  Probably\nthe Marin one will be the more polished performance, but it seems everyone other\ngame developer up here has already stopped by for lunch to see this stuff...\nCheck out www.gdconf.com and look for the \"roadtrips\" link.  Its like $90 for\nthe day, and it would suck to give this talk to like 5 people I already know..\n\nAlso, they're starting up another session of the UC Berkeley extension class in the\ncity, which is more of an intro-level game programming thing than the Roadtrip\ndeal, but its still fun.  Last semester's went really well and a couple of \npeople ended up landing cool new jobs.  The UCB extension in the City (and there\nis only one City, as you well know) has moved to a new location, so hopefully the\ntraffic getting in is better.  This semester's class is 5 weeks on Tuesdays, 9/14\nto 10/12 from 6:30pm for 3 hours.  The URL for Berkely extension is \nwww.unex.berkeley.edu.  The course is something like \"Game programming in Windows\"\n(catchy, huh?).  \n\nWhich reminds me, I'm dying to buy a new laptop to drag with me to the class.\nAnyone have any comments, pro or con about those slick Sony Vaio mini-notebooks?\nSerious techno-lust is setting in.

We appreciate all the \nemail inquiries and stuff, but its not yet time to discuss that.\n\nI wanted to mention a course that I've been teaching for the past couple \nyears through the UC Berkeley extension campus in downtown S.F.  Its a 5 \nweek course that runs evenings from 6:30 to 9:30 on Tuesday starting \nMarch 6.  The last couple years the topics were really broad, covering \nDirectDraw, DirectSound, and all that, but I've decided this year to focus \nprimarily on Direct3D8 and only touch upon the other APIs where its \nnecessary to get a simple game demo up and running.  I've found in the \npast that the 3D stuff was what people were mainly interested in, and \nfrankly the other APIs are easy enough to learn on your own.  So this \nyear's course will be a little different from before.  The course is \ngeared to people that know C or C++ but haven't written a 3D game before.  \nIt also covers some game programming basics like simulation loops, basic \ndynamics simulation, world representation, visibilitiy, etc.  If anyone is \ncurious about getting into games on the programming side please check it \nout.  I have a great time doing this each year.  The classes are usually \nreally small, so its a good chance to get 1-on-1 feedback and ideas on \nyour own projects.\n\nThe URL for the course info is http://www.unex.berkeley.edu/cat/326801.html\nIf you can't make it this semester, I'll probably be doing it again next \nyear (on DX9?)\n\nIn other Nihilistic news, I'm happy to report that we've filled our recent \njob opening for an animator, and we'll have an announcement shortly about \nthe new hire.  Thanks to everyone that submitted demo reels and such, and \nwe'll keep everything on file for any future openings.  We're thrilled \nwith the number and quality of submissions we got.  Thanks to Morgan at \ngamasutra.com and Daivd@Factor5 for directing us to \"highend3d.com\" to \nhelp spread the word, those ads really got the ball rolling.\n\nNihilistic folk will be speaking again at the GDC this year.  Designer \nJacob Stephens will be hosting a level design panel including Paul J from \nId, Dario from Valve, Eric B from Raven, and (listed last because I know \nhow won't mind!) Duncan Brown from LucasArts.  Our lead LD Steve Thoms and \nartist Yujin Kiem will be doing a roundtable on LD-artist interaction.  \nAnthony Chiang is repeating his highly-rated roundtable from last year on \ntechnical artists, and I'll be sitting in on a panel on scripting \nlanguages for game engines that includes Tim from Epic, and top guys from \nBioware, LucasArts, and Microsoft.  Should be a fun year.  The keynotes \nshould be good too, Iain McKaig from Lucasfilm for art, Wil Wright for \ngame design, and Marivin Minsky for programming, among others.\n\n\n(File last updated on Tue 27 Feb 2001 at 10:57)"}, {"by": "israel@lith.com", "time": 926361000, "contents": "\n*** Monolith Production's Finger Server\n\nUser name: israel\nPlan modified: Mon May 10 13:10:19 1999\n\n\t\t\t\t5/10/99\n\n\n\t\tWell, It\u00c2\u0092s a beautiful morning this fine Monday only five days before my wedding.

It\u00c2\u0092s so utterly horrible that it cannot be imagined.  The mere scent of it is enough to drive someone into the fields of micro-management and nose hair plucking.  In these fields many breeds of near human cattle graze upon bitter foliage.  I was so scarred by my first encounter with a vat of tedium that all I could do for the following year was to watch reruns of Thirty Something and sit on my couch drooling over tax forms.  The only thing that saved me was the random emails that my feline filching friend DFB had scattered throughout the bureaucraticallisticisms of my pulpy pile of legalspeak hogswallow.  He helped find my happy place, which by the way is on the way to Neverland but instead of turning left at the second light you turn right and follow the wormhole until you get to the furry lump. Say the word owldrahbraghdiim five times fast backwards and you will be instantly transported to the greatest housing development on the East Side of Dream.  Once there ask for Manfred.

Here is where the greatest revolution against the Dreaded Doldrums, the Wooden Aardvarks, their cousins the Woolen Cardsharques and their evil agents of great fishiness, the vile Fishers of Men Plans and sends forth it's own agents to topple the Tower of Tedium and the evil empire which grows ever stronger in it's shadow.\nSo beware, all of you, the unfriendly eaters of dreams and their nefarious coterie of colostomy crooks. \n\nViva la revolution!\n\n\n\n2/24/99\n\n\n\n\n      It's been years since last we've talked.

I haven't gotten a lot of sleep lately.\n\nWell, I think I came to the verdict that my previous update was a stupid question to ask. Considering what I wrote, the responses (a total of 4 I believe) were pretty good. In the sake of courtesy, I will not print the name and e-mail of those who responded\n\n\"As for hammering out a badass Q3 mod...\"\n\n\"So in answer to your originally questions, yes if the mod is good (which it hopefully would be) but no if the mod is crap.\"\n\nMy first mistake in the .plan update. I shouldn't have automatically assumed it would be \"bad ass\". Of course most people would like a mod if it was \"bad ass\". My real point in saying that was \"Do people know the Coven well enough to take note JUST for releasing the mod\". Terrible wording on my part.\n\n\"Since you have .plan files right up there with id Software, Raven, Dynamix, etc.; it seems that The Coven is a mod group who tries to compete with commercial games.  Kinda makes you raise an eyebrow.\"\n\nhehe. Competition is hardly an issue when compared to these companies. If we were dealing with making mods for all/many of these companies or had made our OWN games, this would be an issue. To date, however, we have only made mods for Id's products, pinning us at the heels of these companies. Not much of a competition to these guys. I'd say we're closer to competing with Evolve and Endor Productions (both groups of excellent designers, from what I've seen).\n\n\"What a stupid question, you must be feeling really down if you're wondering things like that :( Ofcourse people care if its good and you know how to market it.\"\n\nTrue. The question in and of itself says very little for my self-worth. More inaccurate wording on my part.\n\n\"Have you though of inviting some gaming magazines to do articles?\"\n\nNumerous times. The problem is this: Why would a magazine care if the public doesn't care. We have, in fact, approached numerous magazines about our past products, and got about a page of mention about Disposable Heroes in a UK magazine. However, magazines (in my belief) have no obligation to take note of something the public already hasn't. In this case, we'd done (IMO) a good job, and a lot of OTHER places took note...but the public didn't care, expecially since it was a cheap lot of Mods that was about a year late in the making.\n\n\"Or maybe you could sell your products to the magazines so they had something to publish on their cover cd's.\"\n\nSold an OEM version of DH for a few hundred to a magazine. They put it on a cover disk. OOoopsy! No additional profit generated! :)\n\n\"I'm not trying to be rude or anything.  It's just that most of us are\nwondering when we'll see commercial product come from your doors.\"\n\n2, as a matter of fact. Disposable Heroes, a google of mods and skins for Quake and Quake 2 and Deadlode2, a damn good Q2 teamplay mod, focusing on realistics in physics and weapons. In addition to that, Deadlode 2 is extremely modifiable for any server. I don't think thats really what you meant though.

Cable companies can't even keep\n\ta unidirectional broadcast up reliably;\n\twho expects them to do better with point\n\tto point bidirectional data?  not me; I\n\tlove my DSS!\n\n4) 56kbps modems:\n\t(or whatever the next step is after the 33.6kbps is)\n\tthey'll have the usual initial compatability problems\n\tand lack of ISP support, but they'll do great.  What\n\tis there to compete?

If you need to make a linked\nlist, make your own link field.  chain gets written by\nsome of the builtin functions (like findradius) so your\nlist can get screwed.\n\nIf you don't want an entity to touch things anymore, don't\nchange it's .touch to SUB_Null.  Instead change it's .solid\nto SOLID_NOT.  Both ways work, but having the the entity\nstill solid means that the engine must still go through all\nthe steps of detecting collisions and calling the null\nfunction (IOW, it's slower).\n\nIf an entity does not need to think then just do not update\nit's nextthink field.  Having a think function that really\ndoesn't do anything is bad for the same reasons as the touch\nfunction in the previous tip.\n\nDo not have an entity think more often than is necessary.\nThis is mainly to keep your prgs net friendly.  Let's say\nyou have an entity that thinks every 0.05 seconds (20\ntimes per sec, the default max rate for a dedicated server).\nYes, you could do some really cool stuff.  The problem is\nthat you are potentially causing that entity to be updated\nin every single message from the client to the server; it\ndepends on what you do in the think, but it quite likely.\nRemember: The bigger the messages, the more likely it is\nthe clients will see lag.\n\n\nw00p list\n---------\nM3's (red or black)\nGirl Scout cookies (Samoas)\n\nllama list\n----------\nanybody who uses a client side bot\n\t(without making it *REALLY* obvious it's a bot)\n\n--------------------\n\nJohn Cash\n\njcash@idsoftware.com\n\n"}, {"by": "jcash@idsoftware.com", "time": 859176000, "contents": "[idsoftware.com]\nLogin name: jcash                       In real life: John Cash\nDirectory: /raid/nardo/jcash            Shell: /bin/csh\nLast login Mon Mar 24 12:56 on ttyp5 from idtokay\nPlan:\nBusy, busy, busy workin' on Quake2.

Cooked rare or medium rare.\n                Burgers, steaks, meatballs.. whatever.\n                No steak sauce, but gravy or juice is good.\n        Fried stuff:\n                Mainly potato chips and french fries.\n                Not those lame baked ones; real ones with\n                salt and oil and fat (and flavor) and maybe\n                bbq, vinegar, or something hot/spicy.\n        Dessert\n                Good stuff, not that low fat/low calorie crap.\n                Whipped cream is a definite plus.

Anytime you want.  I find\n        a snack to be good right before or right\n        after exercising.  Contrary to what you might\n        be thinking, fruit is actually OK as a snack...\n        as long as you \"wash it down\" with a candy bar.\n\nExercise:\n        Hey, what kind of diet doesn't include exercise?\n        This is the key to my diet.  There is only one\n        exercise that is aerobic, burns lots of calories,\n        and you'll actually enjoy doing.  As an added\n        bonus it can be singles, couples, or even teams.\n        I'm talking, of course, about good old fashioned\n        sex.  The more the better (but take it easy when\n        working out alone!)  BTW, here's where that\n        whipped cream on the desserts can come in handy.\n\nThere you have it.  I think it'll catch on.. I mean,\nwhat is there not to like?\n\nSo, I hear you thinking: sounds great, but does it\nreally work?  Well, it does for me.  I'm 5'10\" and\nweigh 125 pounds.  I eat what I want, when I want,\nand \"work out\" as often as possible (w00p!!!)\n\nWarning: There is one possible side effect of this\ndiet...   ummm... I have two of 'em... both boys\nSo practice safe dieting.\n\n\n\nQuakeC Tips\n-----------\nDon't use the chain field.  If you need to make a linked\nlist, make your own link field.  chain gets written by\nsome of the builtin functions (like findradius) so your\nlist can get screwed.\n\nIf you don't want an entity to touch things anymore, don't\nchange it's .touch to SUB_Null.  Instead change it's .solid\nto SOLID_NOT.  Both ways work, but having the the entity\nstill solid means that the engine must still go through all\nthe steps of detecting collisions and calling the null\nfunction (IOW, it's slower).\n\nIf an entity does not need to think then just do not update\nit's nextthink field.  Having a think function that really\ndoesn't do anything is bad for the same reasons as the touch\nfunction in the previous tip.\n\nDo not have an entity think more often than is necessary.\nThis is mainly to keep your prgs net friendly.  Let's say\nyou have an entity that thinks every 0.05 seconds (20\ntimes per sec, the default max rate for a dedicated server).\nYes, you could do some really cool stuff.  The problem is\nthat you are potentially causing that entity to be updated\nin every single message from the client to the server; it\ndepends on what you do in the think, but it quite likely.\nRemember: The bigger the messages, the more likely it is\nthe clients will see lag.\n\n\nw00p list\n---------\nThe Cash diet plan\nFemale Quake players\nGirl Scout cookies\n        Samoas are the best.  Sorry, news dudes.\n        Thin Mints (and the peanut butter ones)\n        are good too, but Samoas rule.  They\n        give you more reason to \"diet\" ;-)\n\nllama list\n----------\na minor bot rant:\n        complete bots are cool.  I mean bots that\n        try to play entirely by themselves with\n        absolutely no human input (Reaper style).\n\n        augmentation bots (aka proxy bots, like\n        the stooge bot) are NOT.  I am sick and\n        tired of lamers using these things and\n        trying to lie and saying they are not.\n        Those fools are giving llamas a bad name.\n\n--------------------\n\nJohn Cash\n\njcash@idsoftware.com\n\n"}, {"by": "jcash@idsoftware.com", "time": 926902860, "contents": "Welcome to id Software's Finger Service V1.5!\n\nName: John Cash\nEmail: jcash@idsoftware.com\nDescription: Programmer\nProject: Quake 3 Arena\nLast Updated: 05/16/1999 21:39:19 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEpisode 1\n=========\nI went, I saw, it kicked ass!!!\n\nFront\nBack\n\n--------------------\n\nJohn Cash\njcash@idsoftware.com\n\"Hellrot\""}, {"by": "jcash@idsoftware.com", "time": 927054060, "contents": "Welcome to id Software's Finger Service V1.5!\n\nName: John Cash\nEmail: jcash@idsoftware.com\nDescription: Programmer\nProject: Quake 3 Arena\nLast Updated: 05/18/1999 15:37:52 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ3TEST\n======\n\nIPX: The current build of Q3TEST's IPX support is broken.

We have provided an incredibly powerful (and free) method of allowing people to build teams for creating games, yet few people are using it. Maybe it's our fault because we haven't explained it well enough or maybe our user interface is bad, but whatever it is, get over it and use the Marketplace!! \n\nFor those of you that don't know what it is, the GarageGames Marketplace is a free, game development-only version of job sites such as Monster.com, eLance, or Hotjobs.com. \n\nIn the Marketplace you can post your profile/resume to let others see what you are doing. Your profile can be posted in any of three over thirteen categories such as Programmer, Web Developer, Designer, etc. In addition, you can enter your specialty (in your own words), skill level, talent descriptions, work samples, screen shots, and URL links to your own works. \n\nEven if you are happily employed, it doesn't hurt to promote yourself a little. For this situation we allow you to choose an option that tells readers you are Employed, Make No Offers, or if you are feeling frisky, you can choose Employed, But Willing To Listen:) \n\nIn a similar manner you can post your Company and Project information for self promotion or simply to communicate what you are doing and get feedback from a vibrant development community. \n\nLastly, we have Help Wanted Ads that allow you to post job or team openings. These ads can range from large companies with paying positions all the way down to first timers trying to solicit like-minded team members for their first project. \n\nI can tell you that this system works. In the past month, Monster Studios has successfully recruited a sub-contract programmer, two low poly 3D shape artists, and a musician/sfx specialist. They were all small projects, but they all paid money to the developers. \n\nGarageGames does not make money off the Marketplace, but it also doesn't cost us much to run it. We see it as a service to back up our mission statement of providing technology, tools, team building, education, and a market for indie game developers.\n"}, {"by": "jeremy@lith.com", "time": 926970180, "contents": "\n*** Monolith Production's Finger Server\n\nUser name: jeremy\nPlan modified: Mon May 17 14:37:13 1999\n\n \n05/17/1999\n----\nWhee!

Crescent Fresh!!!\n\nthat is all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan this!!!\n\nWell, judging by the amount of responses I recieved, it seems there a lot of people out there who like Jack Kirby's stuff as much as I do.\n\nI offer up then another brilliant artist who's work is usually loved or hated(rarely any in-between)in comics' fandom at least.\n\nMIKE MIGNOLA.\n\nI have been awestruck by Mignola's art since I first saw it. From his earlier D.C. work on Cosmic Odyssey to his more recent work on Batman: Gotham By Gaslight, Dracula (Topps), Doctor Doom/Doctor Strange, Phantom Stranger, Fafhared and The Grey Mouser,Aliens Salvation(Dark Horse), Legends of the Dark Knight #54 and his brilliant creator-owned series: HELL BOY(Dark Horse). \n\nEspecially \"Hell Boy: Wake the Devil\". It's creepy.\n\nSpecifically, Mike Mignola's art is hands-down the best in comics right now. No one uses dramatic lighting like he does. The detail he illustrates serves more to texture the creepy-crawly-creatures and moody sets than to render for the sake of rendering. Don't get me wrong rendering can be awesome, when done right--(Will Eisner,Berni Wrightson, Frank Miller, Kelly Jones, Timothy Bradstreet,etc.)--Unfortunately, most comic-book artists today seem to illustrate books hoping computer-coloring will save them the trouble of setting a mood in the black and white line art. More often than not, these artists tend to put so many of the same stylized little hatchings everywhere, that the rocks have the same texture as the people. Even worse, they do it to hide the poorly executed figures, or backgrounds.\n\nMike Mignola's art appears too simple for some comic-fans(perhaps those fans who can't see past the latest X-Men artist), but if you ask most artists and some fans they'll tell you that's where the brilliance in his art lies. Simplicity. Basic black shapes and great story-telling. You're never distracted by his art when you're reading the Hell Boy books, it's like for once the art and story have become one entity. Most of the X-Books I buy, I tend to breeze through looking at the art first and then I'll read it.  With Mignola's stuff it sucks you in like a great movie would. You don't start thinking about all the work that went into the book until the story has taken you to it's inevitable end. I could say the same about movies like \"Saving Private Ryan\" or \"Brave Heart\".\n\nStory-telling. Something a lot of comic-book artists could learn. \n\nthat's my opinon anyways...Peace--JIM\n\nwell I only found one site for the interested parties out there to visit, go check it out!\n\nhttp://www.abraxis.com/alz/Hellboy.html \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW PLAN!!!\n\nJack Kirby is the ArtGod.(especially for comicbooks!)\n\nHe was the ultimate conceptual artist. Imagine if \"King Kirby\" designed video games... The weapons alone would be mind-blowing. (how would one do \"Kirby-crackles\" in a 3d engine?...hmmm...) \n\nHis far-out character design, and wacky level architecture would, at the very least, artistically dwarf anything out there. His plot would delightfully confuse and enlighten the interactive gaming community. Alas, because he has passed away we may never know... I urge any artist to take five mintues to study some of his illustrations and some of his comic books.(especially those who have no idea who Jack Kirby is/was) You'll be creatively refreshed, possibly inspired. I can't help but be influenced by his amazing designs lately, anyway just thought I'd share...\n\nARTISTS GO CHECK THESE OUT!!!!\n\nHere's a crazy space-ship!!!

Paul is a cool guy and a talented mutha' fucker.\n\nI would also like to report that Daikatana's rendered cinematics are looking incredible.  I just finished doodling another set of storyboards written by Christian, and after seeing what Jerry and the cinematic guys are doing I can't wait to see these new shots animated.\n\nI have also been playing Daikatana a bit.  Wow.  All the weapons are rad.  My favorite is the \"ION Blaster\"-It's probably the weapon design I liked drawing the most, and that combined with  Ken's awesome fucking skin, a killer 3D model and the weapon effects on it make it my personal favorite so far....who knows, every time I look at the progress of the game I see crazy-new stuff.\n\nFor now though:  the \"ION Blaster\" kicks your ass!!\n\nI would also like to quickly kiss-the-ass of the current Daikatana ART team:\n\nJerry O' Flaherty-funky boss/ hard-core-bad-ass-art director\nBryan Pritchard-fearless leader/ lightwave master\nRonn Harbin-amazing animator/ massive modeler\nPete Hushvahtov---model-building-big-boy/  the russian destruction!\nKen Scott-sensational skin artist/ texture-titillation man\nAndy Chang-luscious level texturer/ Funng!!\nAndrew Collins-sexy San Fransisco textures/ cool-whip!\nChuck Crist---groovy Greek level textures/ \"the Host with the Most, but don't burn the Toast!\"\nMark Morgan-miraculous medieval level textures/ he basically rules.\n\n(Russ, Clay, and Jeff are in Austin now but they rock too!)\n\nI would especially like to thank the God of Art who has deeply inspired us all....

William Scarboro, whom I worked with at 3D Realms, died of a sever asthma\nattack on August 9.  His funeral was today at 1pm.  Here's the obituary: \nhttp://www.legacy.com/dallasmorningnews/LegacySubPage2.asp?Page=LifeStory&PersonId=446857\n\nFor those who didn't know William, he programmed the actors and weapons in Rise of the\nTriad, and he coded the renderer that was going to be used for Prey.  You can thank\nWilliam for the /EKG (Engine Killing Gibs) cheat in ROTT, as well as the over the top\nweapon effects that most people remember from the game.\n\nWilliam found humor in extreme or excessive demonstrations of power.  If he saw \nanything that impressed him to some degree, it was \"destructive\", \"sad\", or \"gone\".  You\nsort of had to know his lingo to get what he was saying.\n\nFor William, math was the ultimate expression of power.  He would call me up some nights to\ndescribe to me some new mathematical concept he'd read about.  In many ways, he helped me\nbetter understand the math involved in 3D engines.  Later, after he left the game industry,\nhe became a fan of component programming and COM.

It's always disappointed me that current consoles\nweren't programmable like some of the early systems were.  I first started\nprogramming on a Bally Arcade using the BASIC language cartridge that shipped\nwith the system and later moved to an Atari 800 (though it wasn't really priced\nas a console).\n\nConsoles tend to be more friendly and less imposing than a PC.  While Linux\nis a bit more hefty than popping in a BASIC language cartridge, at least it's\na start towards opening up consoles to the hobbyist programmer.  It also\nopens up the possibility of some really neat applications of the PS2 in the\nhome.\n\nOf course, YABasic (in Europe) and Artdink's Basic Studio are also nice\nsolutions.\n\nMarch 21, 2001\n--------------\n\nRobert came in today with a copy of Serious Sam by Croteam.  The game is\na blast to play and to watch!  By the second level Duffy had 5 guys watching \nover his shoulder (there probably would have been more, but half the\ncompany is out at CGDC).  For $20, Serious Sam is a total deal.\n\nBuy it!  I want to see more games from Croteam! :)\n\n\nMarch 19, 2001\n--------------\n\nCongratulations to the Tribes 2 team on going gold!

Lately, I've realized I've been totally converted over to the Darkside.  I have a Microsoft Mouse, keyboard, speakers, use Windows this, use Office 2000, Use Frontpage daily..  Anyway, OK, so I'm a \"Bill Software Groupie\" I guess.  :)  Anyway, Frontpage quirkiness came up to bite me in the ass today.  Here's a story..\n\nYou know how when you're on a web site, and you put your mouse over a picture, and you see some descriptive text?  Well, in HTML, that's called an \"Alt Tag\".  Microsoft's Frontpage 98 has a rather brain dead feature where it will force you to have an alt tag on inserted images, whether you want it or not.   If you don't pick it, your alt tag will end up looking something like this: alt=\"DNF_Nov99_Area51.jpg (707019 bytes)\".  Well, that's fine for something of that nature.  However...\n\nAs you know, our new web site is under construction, and I'm in the process of moving over all the content from the old site to the new layout.  Brian Cozzens did all the base art again for the new site, and he put the skeleton together using Frontpage98.  The layout uses several small image place graphics to construct the layout.  Anyways, I just realized that today, because of this \"feature\" of FP98, I have a *TON* of alt tags all over my pages that look something like this:\n\nalt=\"transblock.gif (43 bytes)\"\nalt=\"boxbottomleft.gif (55 bytes)\"\nalt=\"boxbottomright.gif (55 bytes)\"\nalt=\"boxgreyleft.gif (81 bytes)\"\nalt=\"barbottomleft.gif (221 bytes)\"\nalt=\"barbottomright.gif (166 bytes)\"\n\nThat's just some of them.  These stupid tiny little graphics generate these alt tags.  It doesn't make the pages look bad - until you happen to hover your mouse over one of these images - and then you see \"transblock.gif (43 bytes)\" as the hover text.  Arrrrrrrgh!  As of right now, I have 314 HTML pages that comprise the total site, and I've got a bunch more to go.  OK, no big deal to remove these, really.  I just use the Global Search & Replace feature of Frontpage 2000 (which is what I'm using).  Well, that brings us to our other Microsoft annoyance.\n\nFP2k has such a stupid way of doing Global Search & Replace, I can't believe it.  If I tell FP2k to search for alt=\"transblock.gif (43 bytes)\" and replace it with nothing, it will remove the tag as I wish it.  **HOWEVER**, the way it works is so lame.  FP2k will search through all your HTML pages, and very nicely tell you what pages in your web have these occurrances, and how many are on each page.  OK, load up the first one, and say \"Replace All\".  When you are done with that, it (essentially, I don't remember the exact text now) says \"Do you want to load the next page and replace those\"?   ARRRRRRRRGH!!!   There is no way to _totally automate it_.  The end result is that it will do what you want, but you have to sit there and hit two keystrokes for every page.  When you have over 300 pages, and you need to do about 8 or 9 seperate search & Replaces, you can see where the major annoyance is.\n\nTo make matters worse, I asked out in the Microsoft Frontpage Usenet group about how to get around this, and was told there's no way to do it automatically, except to \"Use Macros\".  Well, that's all and good, except the FP2k macros are in Visual Basic (which I don't understand). \n\nSo, I have to sit here and do all these frickin' keystrokes because of Microsoft's a) Brain dead alt tag policy in Frontpage 98, and their b) Brain dead way of doing search & Replace in Frontpage 2000.  Anyone else run into this and come up with a workaround?\n\n\nSo how is your day going?  :)\n\n\nCD's I've been listening to lately:\n\n1) Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince - Greatest Hits\n2) AC/DC - Ballbreaker\n3) Badlands - Badlands\n4) Blue Murder - Blue Murder\n5) Deep Purple - Perfect Strangers"}, {"by": "joey@ionstorm.com", "time": 929492700, "contents": "\n*** Ion Storm's Finger Server\n\nUser name: joey\nPlan modified: Tue Jun 15 21:18:26 1999\n\n__________\n\n1999-06-15\n__________\n\nBack for a short stint here at Ion.\nHoped those of you at E3 who saw the \nAnachronox camera scriptor liked it :-)\n"}, {"by": "joey@ionstorm.com", "time": 998439240, "contents": "\n*** Ion Storm's Finger Server\n\nUser name: joey\nPlan modified: Tue Aug 21 21:09:22 2001\n\n----------\n\n2001-08-21\n\nPatch 2 is testing at Eidos.\n\nSome of us are still active on www.planetanachronox.com forums\nif you want to reach us about the game.

A lot of people have also expressed\ninterest in editing using our powerful cinematic scriptor and\nscripting language -- we are preparing documentation for a subsequent\nrelease that will be announced on the forums.\n\nI'm one of the last people to clean up my cube.  Right now I'm\nbacking up parts of our data tree and sourcesafe databases in case\nEidos needs us to fix something for the patch.  Our network is being\ndismantled in a few days, I hear.... all the reusable equipment is\ngoing down to the Austin office.\n\nIt's reeeaal quiet up here.\n\nSort of sad to be finally packing up.  All the cubes are empty.\nLots of memories and friends made up here.  Not to mention the lines\nand lines and lines of code :)\n\nWell, that's enough melodrama.\nBest of luck to all ex-Anox team on our job searches...\nSee you guys around.\n\n----------\n\n2001-07-30\n\nAlthough Ion Storm Dallas is no longer, a few of us are using the last \ncouple days of rent left on our space to make one more patch for \nAnachronox while the network and our data trees are still intact.  \nDetails can be found at:\n\nhttp://www.forumplanet.com/planetanachronox/topic.asp?fid=2221&tid=265673\n\nThanks for everybody who has supported us during this long journey.\n\n----------\n\n2001-07-02\n\nPatch 1 is released.  Download and install please.  Fixes many random\ncrash problems across all operating systems.\n\nGraphical fixes in the patch not in the patch readme:\n\n- Environment mapping supported on low-end cards with sorry drivers \n  (glTexGen calls replaced with internal software calculations).\n\n- Polygon z-fighting problems on multi-pass models, on certain cards\n  (especially TNT/TNT2) fixed.\n\nAlso, there is a _dramatic_ speedup on map file loading times (can be\nup to 1000% on some systems).\n\nBy the way, just so you guys know, all three core programmers on\nAnachronox develop under Win2K .... so we have run the game thousands\nof times without problems. I, personally, have only completely locked\nup my win2k anachronox development box two times in the past several\nmonths, and I suspect it was either due to overheating or when I\naccidentally kicked the case really really hard with my left foot\nwhen I tripped into my work area :P\n\nI suspect it is an unfortunate, unlucky combination of hardware and\nsoftware that is causing these persistent win2k (and other os) crash\nproblems, even with the just-released patch.\n\nWe tried to do the best we could testing all the hardware out there.\nI even forced one of our team members to suffer under an Evil Kyro\ncard!! -- just because I was trying to get as diversified an\nenvironment as possible in the office. (I think he hasn't yet\nforgiven me for the pain he had to endure while working on Anachronox\n.... with all the problems on that card).\n\nUnfortunately, we just don't have the testing \"army\" the size of\nMicrosoft, and with the pc hardware market in the state it is in \ntoday.... it is impossible to test all 40 x 10^100 hardware / \nsoftware combinations.\n\nAt this point, the only suggestions I can make are (if you have\nalready installed the patch).....\n\n- Make sure all your memory chips are good -- VERY IMPORTANT.\n  The best one I've used is at http://www.memtest86.com/ \n- Quit all background applications (icq, norton, ALL antivirus).\n- Turn off 3d sound by using setupanox.exe\n- Do a full install to an _uncompressed_ drive.\n- Experiment with using the anox_640gl or anox_1280gl or anox_window\n  batch files.  Do NOT use the anox_v2v3 batch file.\n- Experiment with flipping your desktop color depth between 16 and\n  32 bit.\n- Make sure you have the latest drivers for your video card.\n- Make sure your virtual memory settings are \"let windows decide\" \n  or \"automatic\" and you have a good amount of free disk space on\n  your operating system install drive.\n- On Win2k, install service pack 2.\n- On Win2k, don't use \"compatibility mode\" to run Anachronox.\n- On Win9x, make sure you have installed all critical updates.\n- Fiddle with your cdrom dma settings (if you are very brave).\n\nThese are of course, general suggestions that might apply to any\nsoftware incompatability problems.  I hope this helps the few\nremaining ones out there who are suffering from post-patch problems.\n\n----------\n\n2001-06-30\n\nWell, well.  First plan file update in several YEARS.\n\nAnyways, we are done with the patch, but Eidos will not\ncomplete testing until Monday.

The difficult decisions come up when it comes to \"trades\" of various kinds, where a change will give an increase in performance, but at a cost.\n\nRelative performance trades. Part of being a driver writer is being able to say \"I don't care if stippled, anti-aliased points with texturing go slow\", and optimizing accordingly. Some hardware features, like caches and hierarchical buffers, may be advantages on some apps, and disadvantages on others. Command buffer sizes often tune differently for different applications.\n\nQuality trades. There is a small amount of wiggle room in the specs for pixel level variability, and some performance gains can be had by leaning towards the minimums. Most quality trades would actually be conformance trades, because the results are not exactly conformant, but they still do \"roughly\" the right thing from a visual standpoint. Compressing textures automatically, avoiding blending of very faint transparent pixels, using a 16 bit depth buffer, etc. A good application will allow the user to make most of these choices directly, but there is good call for having driver preference panels to enable these types of changes on naive applications. Many drivers now allow you to quality trade in an opposite manner - slowing application performance by turning on anti-aliasing or anisotropic texture filtering.\n\nConformance trades. Most conformance trades that happen with drivers are unintentional, where the slower, more general fallback case just didn't get called when it was supposed to, because the driver didn't check for a certain combination to exit some specially optimized path. However, there are optimizations that can give performance improvements in ways that make it impossible to remain conformant. For example, a driver could choose to skip storing of a color value before it is passed on to the hardware, which would save a few cycles, but make it impossible to correctly answer glGetFloatv( GL_CURRENT_COLOR, buffer ).\n\nNormally, driver writers will just pick their priorities and make the trades, but sometimes there will be a desire to make different trades in different circumstances, so as to get the best of both worlds.\n\nExplicit application hints are a nice way to offer different performance characteristics, but that requires cooperation from the application, so it doesn't help in an ongoing benchmark battle. OpenGL's glHint() call is the right thought, but not really set up as flexibly as you would like. Explicit extensions are probably the right way to expose performance trades, but it isn't clear to me that any conformant trade will be a big enough difference to add code for.\n\nEnd-user selectable optimizations. Put a selection option in the driver properties window to allow the user to choose which application class they would like to be favored in some way. This has been done many times, and is a reasonable way to do things. Most users would never touch the setting, so some applications may be slightly faster or slower than in their \"optimal benchmark mode\".\n\nAttempt to guess the application from app names, window strings, etc. Drivers are sometimes forced to do this to work around bugs in established software, and occasionally they will try to use this as a cue for certain optimizations.\n\nMy positions:\n\nMaking any automatic optimization based on a benchmark name is wrong. It subverts the purpose of benchmarking, which is to gauge how a similar class of applications will perform on a tested configuration, not just how the single application chosen as representative performs.\n\nIt is never acceptable to have the driver automatically make a conformance tradeoff, even if they are positive that it won't make any difference. The reason is that applications evolve, and there is no guarantee that a future release won't have different assumptions, causing the upgrade to misbehave. We have seen this in practice with Quake3 and derivatives, where vendors assumed something about what may or may not be enabled during a compiled vertex array call. Most of these are just mistakes, or, occasionally, laziness.\n\nAllowing a driver to present a non-conformant option for the user to select is an interesting question. I know that as a developer, I would get hate mail from users when a point release breaks on their whiz-bang optimized driver, just like I do with overclocked CPUs, and I would get the same \"but it works with everything else!\" response when I tell them to put it back to normal. On the other hand, being able to tweak around with that sort of think is fun for technically inclined users. I lean towards frowning on it, because it is a slippery slope from there down in to \"cheating drivers\" of the see-through- walls variety.\n\nQuality trades are here to stay, with anti-aliasing, anisotropic texture filtering, and other options being positive trades that a user can make, and allowing various texture memory optimizations can be a very nice thing for a user trying to get some games to work well. However, it is still important that it start from a completely conformant state by default. This is one area where application naming can be used reasonably by the driver, to maintain user selected per-application modifiers.\n\nI'm not fanatical on any of this, because the overriding purpose of software is to be useful, rather than correct, but the days of game-specific mini- drivers that can just barely cut it are past, and we should demand more from the remaining vendors.\n\nAlso, excessive optimization is the cause of quite a bit of ill user experience with computers.

We were all very busy at the time, but I took a shot at bringing up support over a weekend. I hadn't coded any of the support for the custom ATI extensions yet, but I ran the game using only standard OpenGL calls (this is not a supported path, because without bump mapping everything looks horrible) to see how it would do. It didn't even draw the console correctly, because they had driver bugs with texGen. I thought the odds were very long against having all the new, untested extensions working properly, so I pushed off working on it until they had revved the drivers a few more times.\n\nMy judgment was colored by the experience of bringing up Doom on the original Radeon card a year earlier, which involved chasing a lot of driver bugs. Note that ATI was very responsive, working closely with me on it, and we were able to get everything resolved, but I still had no expectation that things would work correctly the first time.\n\nNvidia's OpenGL drivers are my \"gold standard\", and it has been quite a while since I have had to report a problem to them, and even their brand new extensions work as documented the first time I try them. When I have a problem on an Nvidia, I assume that it is my fault. With anyone else's drivers, I assume it is their fault. This has turned out correct almost all the time. I have heard more anecdotal reports of instability on some systems with Nivida drivers recently, but I track stability separately from correctness, because it can be influenced by so many outside factors.\n\nATI had been patiently pestering me about support for a few months, so last month I finally took another stab at it. The standard OpenGL path worked flawlessly, so I set about taking advantage of all the 8500 specific features. As expected, I did run into more driver bugs, but ATI got me fixes rapidly, and we soon had everything working properly. It is interesting to contrast the Nvidia and ATI functionality:\n\nThe vertex program extensions provide almost the same functionality. The ATI hardware is a little bit more capable, but not in any way that I care about. The ATI extension interface is massively more painful to use than the text parsing interface from nvidia. On the plus side, the ATI vertex programs are invariant with the normal OpenGL vertex processing, which allowed me to reuse a bunch of code. The Nvidia vertex programs can't be used in multipass algorithms with standard OpenGL passes, because they generate tiny differences in depth values, forcing you to implement EVERYTHING with vertex programs. Nvidia is planning on making this optional in the future, at a slight speed cost.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the vertex object / vertex array range extensions. ATI's extension seems more \"right\" in that it automatically handles synchronization by default, and could be implemented as a wire protocol, but there are advantages to the VAR extension being simply a hint. It is easy to have a VAR program just fall back to normal virtual memory by not setting the hint and using malloc, but ATI's extension requires different function calls for using vertex objects and normal vertex arrays.\n\nThe fragment level processing is clearly way better on the 8500 than on the Nvidia products, including the latest GF4. You have six individual textures, but you can access the textures twice, giving up to eleven possible texture accesses in a single pass, and the dependent texture operation is much more sensible. This wound up being a perfect fit for Doom, because the standard path could be implemented with six unique textures, but required one texture (a normalization cube map) to be accessed twice. The vast majority of Doom light / surface interaction rendering will be a single pass on the 8500, in contrast to two or three passes, depending on the number of color components in a light, for GF3/GF4 (*note GF4 bitching later on).\n\nInitial performance testing was interesting. I set up three extreme cases to exercise different characteristics:\n\nA test of the non-textured stencil shadow speed showed a GF3 about 20% faster than the 8500. I believe that Nvidia has a slightly higher performance memory architecture.\n\nA test of light interaction speed initially had the 8500 significantly slower than the GF3, which was shocking due to the difference in pass count. ATI identified some driver issues, and the speed came around so that the 8500 was faster in all combinations of texture attributes, in some cases 30+% more. This was about what I expected, given the large savings in memory traffic by doing everything in a single pass.\n\nA high polygon count scene that was more representative of real game graphics under heavy load gave a surprising result. I was expecting ATI to clobber Nvidia here due to the much lower triangle count and MUCH lower state change functional overhead from the single pass interaction rendering, but they came out slower. ATI has identified an issue that is likely causing the unexpected performance, but it may not be something that can be worked around on current hardware.\n\nI can set up scenes and parameters where either card can win, but I think that current Nvidia cards are still a somewhat safer bet for consistent performance and quality.\n\nOn the topic of current Nvidia cards:\n\nDo not buy a GeForce4-MX for Doom.\n\nNvidia has really made a mess of the naming conventions here. I always thought it was bad enough that GF2 was just a speed bumped GF1, while GF3 had significant architectural improvements over GF2. I expected GF4 to be the speed bumped GF3, but calling the NV17 GF4-MX really sucks.\n\nGF4-MX will still run Doom properly, but it will be using the NV10 codepath with only two texture units and no vertex shaders. A GF3 or 8500 will be much better performers. The GF4-MX may still be the card of choice for many people depending on pricing, especially considering that many games won't use four textures and vertex programs, but damn, I wish they had named it something else.\n\nAs usual, there will be better cards available from both Nvidia and ATI by the time we ship the game.\n\n8:50 pm addendum: Mark Kilgard at Nvidia said that the current drivers already support the vertex program option to be invarint with the fixed function path, and that it turned out to be one instruction FASTER, not slower."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 1016164800, "contents": "Mark Kilgard and Cass Everitt at Nvidia have released a paper on shadow volume rendering with several interesting bits in it.

I tried to set up a \"poster child\" case that would stress the memory subsystem above and beyond any driver or triangle level inefficiencies, but I was unable to get it to ever approach the performance of a GF4.\n\nThe basic hardware support is good, with fragment flexibility better than GF4 (but not as good as ATI 8500), but it just doesn't keep up in raw performance. With a die shrink, this chip could probably be a contender, but there are probably going to be other chips out by then that will completely eclipse this generation of products.\n\nNone of the special features will be really useful for Doom:\n\nThe 10 bit color framebuffer is nice, but Doom needs more than 2 bits of destination alpha when a card only has four texture units, so we can't use it.\n\nAnti aliasing features are nice, but it isn't all that fast in minimum feature mode, so nobody is going to be turning on AA. The same goes for \"surround gaming\". While the framerate wouldn't be 1/3 the base, it would still probably be cut in half.\n\nDisplacement mapping. Sigh. I am disappointed that the industry is still pursuing any quad based approaches. Haven't we learned from the stellar success of 3DO, Saturn, and NV1 that quads really suck?

I was thinking about a certain other companies proposed approach. Matrox's implementation actually looks quite good, so even if we don't use it because of the geometry amplification issues, I think it will serve the noble purpose of killing dead any proposal to implement a quad based solution.\n\nI got a 3Dlabs P10 card in last week, and yesterday I put it through its paces. Because my time is fairly over committed, first impressions often determine how much work I devote to a given card. I didn't speak to ATI for months after they gave me a beta 8500 board last year with drivers that rendered the console incorrectly. :)\n\nI was duly impressed when the P10 just popped right up with full functional support for both the fallback ARB_ extension path (without specular highlights), and the NV10 NVidia register combiners path. I only saw two issues that were at all incorrect in any of our data, and one of them is debatable. They don't support NV_vertex_program_1_1, which I use for the NV20 path, and when I hacked my programs back to 1.0 support for testing, an issue did show up, but still, this is the best showing from a new board from any company other than Nvidia.\n\nIt is too early to tell what the performance is going to be like, because they don't yet support a vertex object extension, so the CPU is hand feeding all the vertex data to the card at the moment. It was faster than I expected for those circumstances.\n\nGiven the good first impression, I was willing to go ahead and write a new back end that would let the card do the entire Doom interaction rendering in a single pass. The most expedient sounding option was to just use the Nvidia extensions that they implement, NV_vertex_program and NV_register_combiners, with seven texture units instead of the four available on GF3/GF4. Instead, I decided to try using the prototype OpenGL 2.0 extensions they provide.\n\nThe implementation went very smoothly, but I did run into the limits of their current prototype compiler before the full feature set could be implemented. I like it a lot. I am really looking forward to doing research work with this programming model after the compiler matures a bit. While the shading languages are the most critical aspects, and can be broken out as extensions to current OpenGL, there are a lot of other subtle-but-important things that are addressed in the full OpenGL 2.0 proposal.\n\nI am now committed to supporting an OpenGL 2.0 renderer for Doom through all the spec evolutions. If anything, I have been somewhat remiss in not pushing the issues as hard as I could with all the vendors. Now really is the critical time to start nailing things down, and the decisions may stay with us for ten years.\n\nA GL2 driver won't give any theoretical advantage over the current back ends optimized for cards with 7+ texture capability, but future research work will almost certainly be moving away from the lower level coding practices, and if some new vendor pops up (say, Rendition back from the dead) with a next-gen card, I would strongly urge them to implement GL2 instead of proprietary extensions.\n\nI have not done a detailed comparison with Cg. There are a half dozen C-like graphics languages floating around, and honestly, I don't think there is a hell of a lot of usability difference between them at the syntax level. They are all a whole lot better than the current interfaces we are using, so I hope syntax quibbles don't get too religious. It won't be too long before all real work is done in one of these, and developers that stick with the lower level interfaces will be regarded like people that write all-assembly PC applications today. (I get some amusement from the all-assembly crowd, and it can be impressive, but it is certainly not effective)\n\nI do need to get up on a soapbox for a long discourse about why the upcoming high level languages MUST NOT have fixed, queried resource limits if they are going to reach their full potential. I will go into a lot of detail when I get a chance, but drivers must have the right and responsibility to multipass arbitrarily complex inputs to hardware with smaller limits. Get over it."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 1043816400, "contents": "NV30 vs R300, current developments, etc\n\nAt the moment, the NV30 is slightly faster on most scenes in Doom than the R300, but I can still find some scenes where the R300 pulls a little bit ahead.  The issue is complicated because of the different ways the cards can choose to run the game.\n\nThe R300 can run Doom in three different modes: ARB (minimum extensions, no specular highlights, no vertex programs), R200 (full featured, almost always single pass interaction rendering), ARB2 (floating point fragment shaders, minor quality improvements, always single pass).\n\nThe NV30 can run DOOM in five different modes: ARB, NV10 (full featured, five rendering passes, no vertex programs), NV20 (full featured, two or three rendering passes), NV30 ( full featured, single pass), and ARB2.\n\nThe R200 path has a slight speed advantage over the ARB2 path on the R300, but only by a small margin, so it defaults to using the ARB2 path for the quality improvements.  The NV30 runs the ARB2 path MUCH slower than the NV30 path. Half the speed at the moment.  This is unfortunate, because when you do an exact, apples-to-apples comparison using exactly the same API, the R300 looks twice as fast, but when you use the vendor-specific paths, the NV30 wins.\n\nThe reason for this is that ATI does everything at high precision all the time, while Nvidia internally supports three different precisions with different performances.  To make it even more complicated, the exact precision that ATI uses is in between the floating point precisions offered by Nvidia, so when Nvidia runs fragment programs, they are at a higher precision than ATI's, which is some justification for the slower speed.  Nvidia assures me that there is a lot of room for improving the fragment program performance with improved driver compiler technology.\n\nThe current NV30 cards do have some other disadvantages:  They take up two slots, and when the cooling fan fires up they are VERY LOUD.  I'm not usually one to care about fan noise, but the NV30 does annoy me.\n\nI am using an NV30 in my primary work system now, largely so I can test more of the rendering paths on one system, and because I feel Nvidia still has somewhat better driver quality (ATI continues to improve, though).  For a typical consumer, I don't think the decision is at all clear cut at the moment.\n\nFor developers doing forward looking work, there is a different tradeoff - the NV30 runs fragment programs much slower, but it has a huge maximum instruction count.  I have bumped into program limits on the R300 already.\n\nAs always, better cards are coming soon.\n\n-----\n\nDoom has dropped support for vendor-specific vertex programs (NV_vertex_program and EXT_vertex_shader), in favor of using ARB_vertex_program for all rendering paths.  This has been a pleasant thing to do, and both ATI and Nvidia supported the move.  The standardization process for ARB_vertex_program was pretty drawn out and arduous, but in the end, it is a just-plain-better API than either of the vendor specific ones that it replaced.  I fretted for a while over whether I should leave in support for the older APIs for broader driver compatibility, but the final decision was that we are going to require a modern driver for the game to run in the advanced modes.  Older drivers can still fall back to either the ARB or NV10 paths.\n\nThe newly-ratified ARB_vertex_buffer_object extension will probably let me do the same thing for NV_vertex_array_range and ATI_vertex_array_object.\n\nReasonable arguments can be made for and against the OpenGL or Direct-X style of API evolution.  With vendor extensions, you get immediate access to new functionality, but then there is often a period of squabbling about exact feature support from different vendors before an industry standard settles down.  With central planning, you can have \"phasing problems\" between hardware and software releases, and there is a real danger of bad decisions hampering the entire industry, but enforced commonality does make life easier for developers.  Trying to keep boneheaded-ideas-that-will-haunt-us-for-years out of Direct-X is the primary reason I have been attending the Windows Graphics Summit for the past three years, even though I still code for OpenGL.\n\nThe most significant functionality in the new crop of cards is the truly flexible fragment programming, as exposed with ARB_fragment_program.  Moving from the \"switches and dials\" style of discrete functional graphics programming to generally flexible programming with indirection and high precision is what is going to enable the next major step in graphics engines.\n\nIt is going to require fairly deep, non-backwards-compatible modifications to an engine to take real advantage of the new features, but working with ARB_fragment_program is really a lot of fun, so I have added a few little tweaks to the current codebase on the ARB2 path:\n\nHigh dynamic color ranges are supported internally, rather than with post-blending.  This gives a few more bits of color precision in the final image, but it isn't something that you really notice.\n\nPer-pixel environment mapping, rather than per-vertex.  This fixes a pet-peeve of mine, which is large panes of environment mapped glass that aren't tessellated enough, giving that awful warping-around-the-triangulation effect as you move past them.\n\nLight and view vectors normalized with math, rather than a cube map.  On future hardware this will likely be a performance improvement due to the decrease in bandwidth, but current hardware has the computation and bandwidth balanced such that it is pretty much a wash.  What it does (in conjunction with floating point math) give you is a perfectly smooth specular highlight, instead of the pixelish blob that we get on older generations of cards.\n\nThere are some more things I am playing around with, that will probably remain in the engine as novelties, but not supported features:\n\nPer-pixel reflection vector calculations for specular, instead of an interpolated half-angle.  The only remaining effect that has any visual dependency on the underlying geometry is the shape of the specular highlight. Ideally, you want the same final image for a surface regardless of if it is two giant triangles, or a mesh of 1024 triangles.  This will not be true if any calculation done at a vertex involves anything other than linear math operations.  The specular half-angle calculation involves normalizations, so the interpolation across triangles on a surface will be dependent on exactly where the vertexes are located.  The most visible end result of this is that on large, flat, shiny surfaces where you expect a clean highlight circle moving across it, you wind up with a highlight that distorts into an L shape around the triangulation line.\n\nThe extra instructions to implement this did have a noticeable performance hit, and I was a little surprised to see that the highlights not only stabilized in shape, but also sharpened up quite a bit, changing the scene more than I expected.  This probably isn't a good tradeoff today for a gamer, but it is nice for any kind of high-fidelity rendering.\n\nRenormalization of surface normal map samples makes significant quality improvements in magnified textures, turning tight, blurred corners into shiny, smooth pockets, but it introduces a huge amount of aliasing on minimized textures.  Blending between the cases is possible with fragment programs, but the performance overhead does start piling up, and it may require stashing some information in the normal map alpha channel that varies with mip level. Doing good filtering of a specularly lit normal map texture is a fairly interesting problem, with lots of subtle issues.\n\nBump mapped ambient lighting will give much better looking outdoor and well-lit scenes.  This only became possible with dependent texture reads, and it requires new designer and tool-chain support to implement well, so it isn't easy to test globally with the current Doom datasets, but isolated demos are promising.\n\nThe future is in floating point framebuffers.  One of the most noticeable thing this will get you without fundamental algorithm changes is the ability to use a correct display gamma ramp without destroying the dark color precision.  Unfortunately, using a floating point framebuffer on the current generation of cards is pretty difficult, because no blending operations are supported, and the primary thing we need to do is add light contributions together in the framebuffer.  The workaround is to copy the part of the framebuffer you are going to reference to a texture, and have your fragment program explicitly add that texture, instead of having the separate blend unit do it.  This is intrusive enough that I probably won't hack up the current codebase, instead playing around on a forked version.\n\nFloating point framebuffers and complex fragment shaders will also allow much better volumetric effects, like volumetric illumination of fogged areas with shadows and additive/subtractive eddy currents.\n\nJohn Carmack"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 1044594000, "contents": "The machinima music video that Fountainhead Entertainment (my wife's company) produced with Quake based tools is available for viewing and voting on at: http://www.mtv.com/music/viewers_pick/ (\"In the waiting line\")\n\nI thought they did an excellent job of catering to the strengths of the medium, and not attempting to make a game engine compete (poorly) as a general purpose renderer.

The issue is complicated because of the different ways the cards can\nchoose to run the game.\n\nThe R300 can run Doom in three different modes: ARB (minimum extensions, no\nspecular highlights, no vertex programs), R200 (full featured, almost always\nsingle pass interaction rendering), ARB2 (floating point fragment shaders,\nminor quality improvements, always single pass).\n\nThe NV30 can run DOOM in five different modes: ARB, NV10 (full featured, five\nrendering passes, no vertex programs), NV20 (full featured, two or three\nrendering passes), NV30 ( full featured, single pass), and ARB2.\n\nThe R200 path has a slight speed advantage over the ARB2 path on the R300, but\nonly by a small margin, so it defaults to using the ARB2 path for the quality\nimprovements.  The NV30 runs the ARB2 path MUCH slower than the NV30 path.\nHalf the speed at the moment.  This is unfortunate, because when you do an\nexact, apples-to-apples comparison using exactly the same API, the R300 looks\ntwice as fast, but when you use the vendor-specific paths, the NV30 wins.\n\nThe reason for this is that ATI does everything at high precision all the\ntime, while Nvidia internally supports three different precisions with\ndifferent performances.  To make it even more complicated, the exact\nprecision that ATI uses is in between the floating point precisions offered by\nNvidia, so when Nvidia runs fragment programs, they are at a higher precision\nthan ATI's, which is some justification for the slower speed.  Nvidia assures\nme that there is a lot of room for improving the fragment program performance\nwith improved driver compiler technology.\n\nThe current NV30 cards do have some other disadvantages:  They take up two\nslots, and when the cooling fan fires up they are VERY LOUD.  I'm not usually\none to care about fan noise, but the NV30 does annoy me.\n\nI am using an NV30 in my primary work system now, largely so I can test more\nof the rendering paths on one system, and because I feel Nvidia still has\nsomewhat better driver quality (ATI continues to improve, though).  For a\ntypical consumer, I don't think the decision is at all clear cut at the\nmoment.\n\nFor developers doing forward looking work, there is a different tradeoff --\nthe NV30 runs fragment programs much slower, but it has a huge maximum\ninstruction count.  I have bumped into program limits on the R300 already.\n\nAs always, better cards are coming soon.\n\n-------------\n\nDoom has dropped support for vendor-specific vertex programs\n(NV_vertex_program and EXT_vertex_shader), in favor of using\nARB_vertex_program for all rendering paths.  This has been a pleasant thing to\ndo, and both ATI and Nvidia supported the move.  The standardization process\nfor ARB_vertex_program was pretty drawn out and arduous, but in the end, it is\na just-plain-better API than either of the vendor specific ones that it\nreplaced.  I fretted for a while over whether I should leave in support for\nthe older APIs for broader driver compatibility, but the final decision was\nthat we are going to require a modern driver for the game to run in the\nadvanced modes.  Older drivers can still fall back to either the ARB or NV10\npaths.\n\nThe newly-ratified ARB_vertex_buffer_object extension will probably let me do\nthe same thing for NV_vertex_array_range and ATI_vertex_array_object.\n\nReasonable arguments can be made for and against the OpenGL or Direct-X style\nof API evolution.  With vendor extensions, you get immediate access to new\nfunctionality, but then there is often a period of squabbling about exact\nfeature support from different vendors before an industry standard settles\ndown.  With central planning, you can have \"phasing problems\" between\nhardware and software releases, and there is a real danger of bad decisions\nhampering the entire industry, but enforced commonality does make life easier\nfor developers.  Trying to keep boneheaded-ideas-that-will-haunt-us-for-years\nout of Direct-X is the primary reason I have been attending the Windows\nGraphics Summit for the past three years, even though I still code for OpenGL.\n\nThe most significant functionality in the new crop of cards is the truly\nflexible fragment programming, as exposed with ARB_fragment_program.  Moving\nfrom the \"switches and dials\" style of discrete functional graphics\nprogramming to generally flexible programming with indirection and high\nprecision is what is going to enable the next major step in graphics engines.\n\nIt is going to require fairly deep, non-backwards-compatible modifications to\nan engine to take real advantage of the new features, but working with\nARB_fragment_program is really a lot of fun, so I have added a few little\ntweaks to the current codebase on the ARB2 path:\n\nHigh dynamic color ranges are supported internally, rather than with\npost-blending.  This gives a few more bits of color precision in the final\nimage, but it isn't something that you really notice.\n\nPer-pixel environment mapping, rather than per-vertex.  This fixes a pet-peeve\nof mine, which is large panes of environment mapped glass that aren't\ntessellated enough, giving that awful warping-around-the-triangulation effect\nas you move past them.\n\nLight and view vectors normalized with math, rather than a cube map.  On\nfuture hardware this will likely be a performance improvement due to the\ndecrease in bandwidth, but current hardware has the computation and bandwidth\nbalanced such that it is pretty much a wash.  What it does (in conjunction\nwith floating point math) give you is a perfectly smooth specular highlight,\ninstead of the pixelish blob that we get on older generations of cards.\n\nThere are some more things I am playing around with, that will probably remain\nin the engine as novelties, but not supported features:\n\nPer-pixel reflection vector calculations for specular, instead of an\ninterpolated half-angle.  The only remaining effect that has any visual\ndependency on the underlying geometry is the shape of the specular highlight.\nIdeally, you want the same final image for a surface regardless of if it is\ntwo giant triangles, or a mesh of 1024 triangles.  This will not be true if\nany calculation done at a vertex involves anything other than linear math\noperations.  The specular half-angle calculation involves normalizations, so\nthe interpolation across triangles on a surface will be dependent on exactly\nwhere the vertexes are located.  The most visible end result of this is that\non large, flat, shiny surfaces where you expect a clean highlight circle\nmoving across it, you wind up with a highlight that distorts into an L shape\naround the triangulation line.\n\nThe extra instructions to implement this did have a noticeable performance\nhit, and I was a little surprised to see that the highlights not only\nstabilized in shape, but also sharpened up quite a bit, changing the scene\nmore than I expected.  This probably isn't a good tradeoff today for a gamer,\nbut it is nice for any kind of high-fidelity rendering.\n\nRenormalization of surface normal map samples makes significant quality\nimprovements in magnified textures, turning tight, blurred corners into shiny,\nsmooth pockets, but it introduces a huge amount of aliasing on minimized\ntextures.  Blending between the cases is possible with fragment programs, but\nthe performance overhead does start piling up, and it may require stashing\nsome information in the normal map alpha channel that varies with mip level.\nDoing good filtering of a specularly lit normal map texture is a fairly\ninteresting problem, with lots of subtle issues.\n\nBump mapped ambient lighting will give much better looking outdoor and\nwell-lit scenes.  This only became possible with dependent texture reads, and\nit requires new designer and tool-chain support to implement well, so it isn't\neasy to test globally with the current Doom datasets, but isolated demos are\npromising.\n\nThe future is in floating point framebuffers.  One of the most noticeable\nthing this will get you without fundamental algorithm changes is the ability\nto use a correct display gamma ramp without destroying the dark color\nprecision.  Unfortunately, using a floating point framebuffer on the current\ngeneration of cards is pretty difficult, because no blending operations are\nsupported, and the primary thing we need to do is add light contributions\ntogether in the framebuffer.  The workaround is to copy the part of the\nframebuffer you are going to reference to a texture, and have your fragment\nprogram explicitly add that texture, instead of having the separate blend unit\ndo it.  This is intrusive enough that I probably won't hack up the current\ncodebase, instead playing around on a forked version.\n\nFloating point framebuffers and complex fragment shaders will also allow much\nbetter volumetric effects, like volumetric illumination of fogged areas with\nshadows and additive/subtractive eddy currents.\n\nJohn Carmack\n\nFeb 7, 2003\n-----------\nThe machinima music video that Fountainhead Entertainment (my wife's company)\nproduced with Quake based tools is available for viewing and voting on at:\nhttp://www.mtv.com/music/viewers_pick/ (\"In the waiting line\")\n\nI thought they did an excellent job of catering to the strengths of the\nmedium, and not attempting to make a game engine compete (poorly) as a\ngeneral purpose renderer.  In watching the video, I did beat myself up a\nbit over the visible popping artifacts on the environment mapping, which are\na direct result of the normal vector quantization in the md3 format.  While it\nisn't the same issue (normals are full floating point already in Doom), it was\nthe final factor that pushed me to do the per-pixel environment mapping for\nthe new cards in the current engine.\n\nThe neat thing about the machinima aspect of the video is that they also have\na little game you can play with the same media assets used to create the\nvideo.

There were two main factors involved in my not doing updates for a long time - a good chunk of my time and interest was sucked into Armadillo Aerospace, and the fact that the work I had been doing at Id for the last half of Doom 3 development was basically pretty damn boring.\n\nThe Armadillo work has been very rewarding from a learning-lots-of-new-stuff perspective, and I'm still committed to the vehicle development, even post X-Prize, but the work at Id is back to a high level of interest now that we are working on a new game with new technology. I keep running across topics that are interesting to talk about, and the Armadillo updates have been a pretty good way for me to organize my thoughts, so I'm going to give it a more general try here. .plan files were appropriate ten years ago, and sort of retro-cute several years ago, but I'll be sensible and use the web.\n\n I'm not quite sure what the tone is going to be - there will probably be some general interest stuff, but a bunch of things will only be of interest to hardcore graphics geeks.\n\n I have had some hesitation about doing this because there are a hundred times as many people interested in listening to me talk about games / graphics / computers as there are people interested in rocket fabrication, and my mailbox is already rather time consuming to get through.\n\n If you really, really want to email me, add a \"[JC]\" in the subject header so the mail gets filtered to a mailbox that isn't clogged with spam. I can't respond to most of the email I get, but I do read everything that doesn't immediately scan as spam. Unfortunately, the probability of getting an answer from me doesn't have a lot of correlation with the quality of the question, because what I am doing at the instant I read it is more dominant, and there is even a negative correlation for \"deep\" questions that I don't want to make an off-the-cuff response to.\n\n   Quake 3 Source\n\nI intended to release the Q3 source under the GPL by the end of 2004, but we had another large technology licensing deal go through, and it would be poor form to make the source public a few months after a company paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for full rights to it. True, being public under the GPL isn't the same as having a royalty free license without the need to disclose the source, but I'm pretty sure there would be some hard feelings.\n\n Previous source code releases were held up until the last commercial license of the technology shipped, but with the evolving nature of game engines today, it is a lot less clear. There are still bits of early Quake code in Half Life 2, and the remaining licensees of Q3 technology intend to continue their internal developments along similar lines, so there probably won't be nearly as sharp a cutoff as before. I am still committed to making as much source public as I can, and I won't wait until the titles from the latest deal have actually shipped, but it is still going to be a little while before I feel comfortable doing the release.\n\n   Random Graphics Thoughts\n\nYears ago, when I first heard about the inclusion of derivative instructions in fragment programs, I couldn't think of anything off hand that I wanted them for. As I start working on a new generation of rendering code, uses for them come up a lot more often than I expected.\n\n I can't actually use them in our production code because it is an Nvidia-only feature at the moment, but it is convenient to do experimental code with the nv_fragment_program extension before figuring out various ways to build funny texture mip maps so that the built in texture filtering hardware calculates a value somewhat like the derivative I wanted.\n\n If you are basically just looking for plane information, as you would for modifying things with texture magnification or stretching shadow buffer filter kernels, the derivatives work out pretty well. However, if you are looking at a derived value, like a normal read from a texture, the results are almost useless because of the way they are calculated. In an ideal world, all of the samples to be differenced would be calculated at once, then the derivatives calculated from there, but the hardware only calculates 2x2 blocks at a time. Each of the four pixels in the block is given the same derivative, and there is no influence from neighboring pixels. This gives derivative information that is basically half the resolution of the screen and sort of point sampled. You can often see this effect with bump mapped environment mapping into a mip-mapped cube map, where the texture LOD changes discretely along the 2x2 blocks. Explicitly coloring based on the derivatives of a normal map really shows how nasty the calculated value is.\n\n Speaking of bump mapped environment sampling.. I spent a little while tracking down a highlight that I thought was misplaced. In retrospect it is obvious, but I never considered the artifact before: With a bump mapped surface, some of the on-screen normals will actually be facing away from the viewer. This causes minor problems with lighting, but when you are making a reflection vector from it, the vector starts reflecting into the opposite hemisphere, resulting in some sky-looking pixels near bottom edges on the model. Clamping the surface normal to not face away isn't a good solution, because you get areas that \"see right through\" to the environment map, because a reflection past a clamped perpendicular vector doesn't change the viewing vector. I could probably ramp things based on the geometric normal somewhat, and possibly pre-calculate some data into the normal maps, but I decided it wasn't a significant enough issue to be worth any more development effort or speed hit.\n\n Speaking of cube maps.. The edge filtering on cube maps is showing up as an issue for some algorithms. The hardware basically picks a face, then treats it just like a 2D texture. This is fine in the middle of the texture, but at the edges (which are a larger and larger fraction as size decreases) the filter kernel just clamps instead of being able to sample the neighbors in an adjacent cube face. This is generally a non-issue for classic environment mapping, but when you start using cube map lookups with explicit LOD bias inputs (say, to simulate variable specular powers into an environment map) you can wind up with a surface covered with six constant color patches instead of the smoothly filtered coloration you want. The classic solution would be to implement border texels, but that is pretty nasty for the hardware and API, and would require either the application or the driver to actually copy the border texels from all the other faces. Last I heard, upcoming hardware was going to start actually fetching from the other side textures directly. A second-tier chip company claimed to do this correctly a while ago, but I never actually tested it.\n\n Topics continue to chain together, I'll probably write some more next week."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 1117166400, "contents": "Cell phone adventures\n\nI'm not a cell phone guy. I resisted getting one at all for years, and even now I rarely carry it. To a first approximation, I don't really like talking to most people, so I don't go out of my way to enable people to call me. However, a little while ago I misplaced the old phone I usually take to Armadillo, and my wife picked up a more modern one for me. It had a nice color screen and a bunch of bad java game demos on it. The bad java games did it.\n\n I am a big proponent of temporarily changing programming scope every once in a while to reset some assumptions and habits. After Quake 3, I spent some time writing driver code for the Utah-GLX project to give myself more empathy for the various hardware vendors and get back to some low-level register programming. This time, I decided I was going to work on a cell phone game.\n\n I wrote a couple java programs several years ago, and I was left with a generally favorable impression of the language. I dug out my old \"java in a nutshell\" and started browsing around on the web for information on programming for cell phones. After working my way through the alphabet soup of J2ME, CLDC, and MIDP, I've found that writing for the platform is pretty easy.\n\n In fact, I think it would be an interesting environment for beginning programmers to learn on. I started programming on an Apple II a long time ago, when you could just do an \"hgr\" and start drawing to the screen, which was rewarding. For years, I've had misgivings about people learning programming on Win32 (unix / X would be even worse), where it takes a lot of arcane crap just to get to the point of drawing something on the screen and responding to input. I assume most beginners wind up with a lot of block copied code that they don't really understand.\n\n All the documentation and tools needed are free off the web, and there is an inherent neatness to being able to put the program on your phone and walk away from the computer. I wound up using the latest release of NetBeans with the mobility module, which works pretty well. It certainly isn't MSDev, but for a free IDE it seems very capable. On the downside, MIDP debugging sessions are very flaky, and there is something deeply wrong when text editing on a 3.6 ghz processor is anything but instantaneous.\n\n I spent a while thinking about what would actually make a good game for the platform, which is a very different design space than PCs or consoles. The program and data sizes are tiny, under 200k for java jar files. A single texture is larger than that in our mainstream games. The data sizes to screen ratios are also far out of the range we are used to. A 128x128x16+ bit color screen can display some very nice graphics, but you could only store a half dozen uncompressed screens in your entire size budget. Contrast with PCs, which may be up to a few megabytes of display data, but the total game data may be five hundred times that.\n\n You aren't going to be able to make an immersive experience on a 2\" screen, no matter what the graphics look like. Moody and atmospheric are pretty much out. Stylish and fun is about the best you can do.\n\n The standard cell phone style discrete button direction pad with a center action button is a good interface for one handed navigation and selection, but it sucks for games, where you really want a game boy style rocking direction pad for one thumb, and a couple separate action buttons for the other thumb. These styles of input are in conflict with each other, so it may never get any better. The majority of traditional action games just don't work well with cell phone style input.\n\n Network packet latency is bad, and not expected to be improving in the foreseeable future, so multiplayer action games are pretty much out (but see below).\n\n I have a small list of games that I think would work out well, but what I decided to work on is DoomRPG - sort of Bard's Tale meets Doom. Step based smooth sliding/turning tile movement and combat works out well for the phone input buttons, and exploring a 3D world through the cell phone window is pretty neat. We talked to Jamdat about the business side of things, and hired Fountainhead Entertainment to turn my proof-of-concept demo and game plans into a full-featured game.\n\n So, for the past month or so I have been spending about a day a week on cell phone development. Somewhat to my surprise, there is very little internal conflict switching off from the high end work during the day with gigs of data and multi-hundred instruction fragment shaders down to texture mapping in java at night with one table lookup per pixel and 100k of graphics. It's all just programming and design work.\n\n It turns out that I'm a lot less fond of Java for resource-constrained work. I remember all the little gripes I had with the Java language, like no unsigned bytes, and the consequences of strong typing, like no memset, and the inability to read resources into anything but a char array, but the frustrating issues are details down close to the hardware.\n\n The biggest problem is that Java is really slow. On a pure cpu / memory / display / communications level, most modern cell phones should be considerably better gaming platforms than a Game Boy Advanced. With Java, on most phones you are left with about the CPU power of an original 4.77 mhz IBM PC, and lousy control over everything.\n\n I spent a fair amount of time looking at java byte code disassembly while optimizing my little rendering engine. This is interesting fun like any other optimization problem, but it alternates with a bleak knowledge that even the most inspired java code is going to be a fraction the performance of pedestrian native C code.\n\n Even compiled to completely native code, Java semantic requirements like range checking on every array access hobble it. One of the phones (Motorola i730) has an option that does some load time compiling to improve performance, which does help a lot, but you have no idea what it is doing, and innocuous code changes can cause the compilable heuristic to fail.\n\n Write-once-run-anywhere. Ha. Hahahahaha. We are only testing on four platforms right now, and not a single pair has the exact same quirks. All the commercial games are tweaked and compiled individually for each (often 100+) platform. Portability is not a justification for the awful performance.\n\n Security on a cell phone is justification for doing something, but an interpreter isn't a requirement - memory management units can do just as well. I suspect this did have something to do with Java's adoption early on. A simple embedded processor with no MMU could run arbitrary programs securely with java, which might make it the only practical option. However, once you start using blazingly fast processors to improve the awful performance, a MMU with a classic OS model looks a whole lot better.\n\n Even saddled with very low computing performance, tighter implementation of the platform interface could help out a lot. I'm not seeing very conscientious work on the platforms so far. For instance, there is just no excuse for having 10+ millisecond granularity in timing. Given that the java paradigm is sort of thread-happy anyway, having a real scheduler that Does The Right Thing with priorities and hardware interfacing would be an obvious thing. Pressing a key should generate a hardware interrupt, which should immediately activate the key listening thread, which should be able to immediately kill an in-process rendering and restart another one if desired. The attitude seems to be 15 msec here, 20 there, stick it on a queue, finish up a timeslice, who cares, right?\n\n I suspect I will enjoy working with BREW, the competing standard for cell phone games. It lets you use raw C/C++ code, or even, I suppose, assembly language, which completely changes the design options. Unfortunately, they only have a quarter the market share that the J2ME phones have. Also, the relatively open java platform development strategy is what got me into this in the first place - one night I just tried writing a program for my cell phone, which isn't possible for the more proprietary BREW platform.\n\n I have a serious suggestion for the handset designers to go with my idle bitching. I have been told that fixing data packet latency is apparently not in the cards, and it isn't even expected to improve much with the change to 3G infrastructure. Packet data communication seems more modern, and has the luster of the web, but it is worth realizing that for network games and many other flashy Internet technologies like streaming audio and video, we use packets to rather inefficiently simulate a switched circuit.\n\n Cell phones already have a very low latency digital data path - the circuit switched channel used for voice. Some phones have included cellular modems that use either the CSD standard (circuit switched data) at 9.8Kbits or 14.4Kbits or the HSCSD standard (high speed circuit switched data) at 38.4Kbits or 57.6Kbits. Even the 9.8Kbit speed would be great for networked games. A wide variety of two player peer-to-peer games and multiplayer packet server based games could be implemented over this with excellent performance. Gamers generally have poor memories of playing over even the highest speed analog modems, but most of the problems are due to having far too many buffers and abstractions between the data producers/consumers and the actual wire interface. If you wrote eight bytes to the device and it went in the next damned frame (instead of the OS buffer, which feeds into a serial FIFO, which goes into another serial FIFO, which goes into a data compressor, which goes into an error corrector, and probably a few other things before getting into a wire frame), life would be quite good. If you had a real time scheduler, a single frame buffer would be sufficient, but since that isn't likely to happen, having an OS buffer with accurate queries of the FIFO positions is probably best. The worst gaming experiences with modems weren't due to bandwidth or latency, but to buffer pileup."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 1146542400, "contents": "Orcs & Elves\n\nI'm not managing to make regular updates here, but I'll keep this around just in case. I have a bunch of things that I want to talk about -- some thoughts on programming style and reliability, OpenGL, Xbox 360, etc, but we have a timely topic with the release of our second mobile game, Orcs & Elves, that has spurred me into making this update.\n\nDoomRPG, our (Id Software's and Fountainhead Entertainment's) first mobile title, has been very successful, both in sales and in awards. I predict that the interpolated turn based style of 3D gaming will be widely adopted on the mobile platform, because it plays very naturally on a conventional cell phone. Gaming will be a lot better when there is a mass market of phones that can be played more like a gamepad, but you need to make do with what you actually have.\n\nOne of the interesting things about mobile games is that the sales curve is not at all like the drastically front loaded curve of a PC or console game. DoomRPG is selling better now than when it was initially released, and the numbers are promising for supporting additional development work. However, unless I am pleasantly surprised, the hardware capabilities are going to advance much faster than the market in the next couple years, leading to an unusual situation where you can only afford to develop fairly crude games on incredibly powerful hardware. Perhaps \"elegantly simple\" would be the better way of looking at it, but it will still wind up being like developing an Xbox title for $500,000. That will wind up being great for many small game companies that just want to explore an idea, but having resource far in excess of your demands does minimize the value of being a hot shot programmer. :-)\n\nTo some degree this is already the case on high end BREW phones today. I have a pretty clear idea what a maxed out software renderer would look like for that class of phones, and it wouldn't be the PlayStation-esq 3D graphics that seems to be the standard direction. When I was doing the graphics engine upgrades for BREW, I started along those lines, but after putting in a couple days at it I realized that I just couldn't afford to spend the time to finish the work. \"A clear vision\" doesn't mean I can necessarily implement it in a very small integral number of days. I wound up going with a less efficient and less flexible approach that was simple and robust enough to not likely need any more support from me after I handed it over (it didn't).\n\nDuring the development of DoomRPG, I had commented that it seemed obvious that it should be followed up with a \"traditional, Orcs&Elves sort of fantasy game\". A couple people independently commented that \"Orcs&Elves\" wasn't a bad name for a game so since we didn't run into any obstacles, Orcs& Elves it was. Naming new projects is a lot harder than most people think, because of trademark issues.\n\nIn hindsight, we made a strategic mistake at the start of O&E development. We were fresh off the high end BREW version of DoomRPG, and we all liked developing on BREW a lot better than Java. It isn't that BREW is inherently brilliant, it just avoids the deep sucking nature of java for resource constrained platforms (however, note the above about many mobile games not being resource constrained in the future), and allows you to work inside visual studio. O&E development was started high-end first with the low-end versions done afterwards. I should have known better (Anna was certainly suspicious), because it is always easier to add flashy features without introducing any negatives than it is to chop things out without damaging the core value of a game. The high end version is really wonderful, with all the graphics, sound, and gameplay we aimed for, but when we went to do the low end versions, we found that even after cutting the media as we planned, we were still a long way over the 280k java application limit. Rather than just butchering it, we went for pain, suffering, and schedule slippage, eventually delivering a game that still maintained high quality after the de-scoping (the low end platforms still represent the majority of the market). It would have been much easier to go the other way, but the high end phone users will be happy with our mistake.\n\nDoomRPG had three base platforms that were customized for different phones -- Java, low end BREW, and high end BREW. O&E added a high end java version that kept most of the quality of the high end BREW version on phones fast enough to support it from carriers willing to allow the larger download. The download size limits are probably the most significant restriction for gaming on the high end phones. I don't really understand why the carriers encourage streaming video traffic, but balk at a couple megs of game media.\n\nI am really looking forward to the response to Orcs&Elves, because I think it is one of the best product evolutions I have been involved in. The core game play mechanics that were laid out in DoomRPG have proven strong and versatile (again, I bet we have a stable genre here), but now we have a big bag of tricks and a year of polishing the experience behind us, along with a world of some depth. I found it a very good indicator that play testers almost always lost track of time while playing.\n\nThis project was doubly nostalgic for me -- the technology was over a decade old for me, but the content took me back twenty years. All the computer games I wrote in high school were adventure games, and my first two commercial sales were Ultima style games for the Apple II, but Id Software never got around to doing one. Old timers may recall that we were going to do a fantasy game called \"The Fight For Justice\" (starring a hero called Quake...) after Commander Keen, but Wolfenstein 3D and the birth of the FPS sort of got in the way. :-) "}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 1193976000, "contents": "Technology and Games\n\nSource: http://blogs.ign.com/OrcsandElves/2007/11/02/70591/\n\nMost of my time lately is spent working on Rage, id Software's Id Tech 5 based game that runs on PCs, Macs, 360s, and PS3s. A modern high-end game is a really breathtaking consumer of computation and storage resources for anyone that has been around computers for any length of time. Our target platforms have at least 512 mb of ram, almost 20 gb of media storage, and many tens of gflops of computation, but the development environment involves an even more massive deployment, with a terabyte of raw data being generated before the final culling and compression is done. It is easy to be a little nonchalant about the continuous pace of improvement with computing, but I still take the time to feel a sense of awe about it all.\n\nI started programming on a Commodore VIC-20 with 4k of ram and a tape drive, and I remember writing absurdly long lines of basic code to save the couple bytes that a new line number would consume. As the years went by, and my projects moved from the Apple II to the PC and the early consoles, I continued to gain new insights and perspective on different problems, and I often thought that it would be fun to go back to one of the early small systems. Now that I \"knew what I was doing\", I could do a lot more within the tight constraints than I was ever able to before. I actually carried a bunch of old systems around with me from house to house for many years before I reached the conclusion that I never was going to spend any real time on them again, and finally tossed them out.\n\nAs technology continued to rapidly advance, I saw a lot of good programmers sort of peel off from high end game development, and migrate to other platforms where their existing skill sets were still exactly what was needed. There was a large contingent of hard core assembly language programmers that never wanted to \"get soft\" with the move to C for more complex game development, and many of them moved from PCs to platforms like the super Nintendo, and eventually into embedded systems or device firmware. There was another contingent that never wanted to move to windows, and so on.\n\nThere is an appeal to working with tighter constraints. The more limited the platform, the closer you can feel you are getting to an \"optimal\" solution. On a modern big system, there are dozens of ways to accomplish any given task, and it just isn't possible to evaluate all the tradeoffs between the implementations of hundreds of different tasks. On a little system, you have to constrain your design to have a much smaller total number of tasks, and the available options are a lot more reduced. Seeing if something is The Right Thing is a lot easier.\n\nI probably had my personal \"moment of truth\" around the beginning of Doom 3's development, when it became clear that it is no longer possible to deeply understand every single part of a modern application. There is just too much. Nevertheless, I found that I could still enjoy my work when confined to a subset of the entire project, and I have thus remained committed to the high end. However, the appeal of smaller systems still lingers.\n\nA couple years ago, almost on a whim, I got involved in developing games for mobile phones. The primary instigator was when I ran a bunch of games on a new phone and was left frankly appalled at how poor they were. I was thinking to myself \"I wrote better games than this each month before we founded Id\". I downloaded the SDK for the phone, and started tinkering around a bit. A proof of concept demo and a plan for a game play style specifically tailored for cell phones followed, and we wound up with DoomRPG, and later Orcs & Elves which turned out to be big hits.\n\nIn an ideal world, where I could either stop time or clone myself, I would act as a lead programmer for some smaller projects. In the real world, I can't justify spending much time away from the high-end work, so the low-end work gets done in a few short bursts of engine creation and foundation laying, which is then handed over to the Fountainhead team to actually build a great game. After that, Anna mostly uses me as a threat -- if her programmers tell her that something she really wants in a game can't be done, she threatens to call me up and have me tell them how straightforward the problem really is, which usually fuels them to figure out how to do it on their own.\n\nMobile development was fun in a resource constrained design sort of way, but the programming didn't have the \"tight\" feel that early gaming had, due to the huge variability in the platforms. When I was messing around on my own phone, I spent some time doing java bytecode disassembly and timing, but it was fairly pointless in light of the two hundred or so different phones the game would wind up running on.\n\nEnter the Nintendo DS.\n\n\nWe had initially looked at possibly moving one of the cell phone titles over to the GBA, but it didn't look like the market would support it, and technically it would have only turned out somewhere in between the low end and high end cell phone versions. With the success of DS, and a suspicion that the players might be a little more open to new third party titles, EA decided that they would support developing a really enhanced version of Orcs&Elves for the DS. This is going a bit out on a limb -- most successful Game Boy / DS titles have been either first-party Nintendo titles, or titles with a strong movie / toy / history tie in. While Orcs & Elves is doing well on mobile, it is still very far from a recognized brand.\n\nThe resource limits on the DS make it almost perfect for a small team development. The hardware is fun to work with, you can directly poke at all the registers, the tool chain works well, and the built in limitations of cartridge memory keeps the design decisions fairly straightforward. Going one step farther up to the PSP with a UMD brings you into the realm of large media sizes that can rapidly consume multi-million dollar development budgets.\n\nOnce the decision was made to go for it, it was my job to figure out what we could reasonably hope to accomplish on the platform, andbring up a first cut at the 3D rendering engine.\n\nUp next: all the technical details"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 1194498000, "contents": "DS Technology\n\nSource: http://blogs.ign.com/OrcsandElves/2007/11/08/71156/\n\nThe actual implementation decisions for Orcs&Elves DS were driven by the hardware, the development timeline, and the budget. With a five person team, we had six months to bring it all together on a new platform. I wrote the code for the hardware accelerated 3D renderer and for the remainder of the project, I was technical advisor.\n\nThe basic compute power of a 32 bit, 66 mhz arm processor and four megs of ram is a pleasant size to work with, basically about what we had on the PC back when the original Doom was written. You are intrinsically limited to a design that is compact enough that you can wrap your head around every aspect of it at once, but you don't wind up mired in crazy size decisions like trading a couple functions of code for an extra graphical icon.\n\nGoing back to fixed point math is always a chore, and while the DS has hardware acceleration for fixed point math, it doesn't automatically integrate with C/C++ code. The compiler / linker / debugger tool chain worked just fine, and I never felt that I was fighting the development environment like it used to be with the really early consoles. The DS SDK takes my preferred approach of both documenting the hardware fully and providing a helper library with full source code that you can pull apart as necessary.\n\nThe baseline spec we started with was a 16 meg cart for the game. I was sure we could get all the features we were discussing to fit in there, but in hindsight, we really should have pushed for a 32 meg cart, because it would have allowed us to add a lot more high quality 2D art to the game, and include some pre-rendered cinematics to help set the mood and tell the story. Anna had pushed for this from the beginning, but I was worried that we wouldn't have enough time to create the additional media, and I didn't want to eat the extra manufacturing costs on a speculative game release of an unknown IP.\n\nAt first glance, a 16 meg cart is over eight times as large as our high end cell phone distribution, but that turns out to be misleading. Everything is highly compressed on the mobile versions, but because of the need to directly DMA many assets in a usable form on the DS, and sometimes due to the tighter ram limits, a lot of the media takes up more space on the DS. The game is still a lot bigger, but not 8x.\n\nInterfacing with the DS 3D graphics processor was my major contribution to the project. The DS is an unusual graphics machine, with no direct analog before it, but the individual pieces were close enough to things I had experience with that I was able to be effective pretty quickly. While there are a few things I wish would have been done differently, I still found it a lot of fun to work with.\n\n\nThe geometry engine is nice and clean, implementing a good subset of the basic OpenGL pipe in fixed point. It is also quite fast relative to the rest of the system. I had originally laid out the code to double buffer all the command traffic so that the geometry engine could completely overlap with the CPU, but it turned out that we would run into the polygon limits on the rasterizer before the geometry engine worked up much of a sweat, so I just saved memory and let the geometry engine run with a single command buffer. The game logic tended to take more time to process than the geometry engine, so it was almost never a gating factor. A title that heavily used vertex lighting and matrix stack operations might be able to load up the geometry pipeline a bit, but with just texture and color at the verts, it has margin.\n\nUnlike classic OpenGL, you can change the matrix in the middle of specifying a primitive, allowing single bone skinned model rendering to be performed with a conventional vertex pipeline. This was a novel approach that I hadn't seen anywhere else. It was a little odd to see an explicitly separate model and projection matrix in hardware, since they are usually pre-multiplied into a single MVP matrix, but it allows the slow main cpu to avoid having to do some matrix math.\n\nThe question of 3D models versus sprites was one of the most significant decisions for Orcs&Elves. There are several situations in the game where you may be facing six or eight monsters, and I was concerned about how low poly the enemies would have to be to avoid problems with the rasterizer, especially when you consider that monsters can chase you into scenes that may tax the rasterizer all by themselves. Coupled with the fact that developing a new skeletal animation system, building all new models, and animating them would almost certainly have busted our development timeline, in the given circumstances, we decided sprites would do a better job.\n\nThe rasterization side of things on the DS is... quirky. Almost all 3D rendering systems today use a frame buffer and a depth buffer that is stored in dedicated graphics memory and incrementally updated by the graphics processor. The DS essentially renders as it is being displayed, with only a small set of lines acting as a buffer. This saves memory, and can give speed and power savings, but it has some significant tradeoffs.\n\nFailure modes are bad -- If you overload the polygon list, the remaining polygons just don't show up. This can be mediated by drawing the nearby and important things first, so if anything disappears it is hopefully in the distance where it isn't very noticeable. If you overload the fill rate, horizontal bars appear across the screen. In a perspective view, the greatest complexity and density tend to be in the middle of the screen, so if your scene gets too bad, a jittering color bar tends to appear in the center.\n\nIn a conventional rendering engine, overloading complexity just tends to make the game go slower. On the DS, overloading looks broken. This means that you need to leave yourself a lot more margin, and therefore use the hardware less aggressively. The plus side is that since the hardware is re-drawing the screen at 60hz no matter what you do, you are strongly encouraged to make sure the rest of your game also stays at 60hz.\n\n\nThe lack of texture filtering on the DS is the most obvious difference with other current platforms, and it does strongly encourages a cartoony art style for games. The art style for O&E isn't really ideal, and perhaps we should have stylized things a bit more.\n\nYou don't have a lot of texture memory available on the DS, less even than an original Playstation. In O&E, the environment graphics (walls and floors) are allocated statically at map load time, and must be balanced by the level artist. The character sprites are dynamically managed, with high resolution artwork for the monster directly in front of the player being swapped in every frame. The field of view and sprite positioning are carefully managed, along with a \"pushback factor\", to ensure that the sprites are at 1:1 scale when they are one tile away, and 2:1 scale when they are right in front of the player. Without bilinear filtering on the texturing, non-integral scales wind up looking very ugly. This is one of the advantages of the tile based play -- if it was completely free form, the monsters would look a lot uglier. There isn't any intermediate step to be taken to improve the monster rendering without using a full 4x the memory to render an adjacent monster at a 1:1 scale. Even if we had more memory, I probably would have spent it on more animations instead of higher resolution.\n\nThe most disappointing mistake in the DS hardware is the lack of even the basic original blending modes from OpenGL. This was a mistake that was common in the very first generation of PC 3D accelerators, where so many companies just assumed that \"blending\" meant \"alpha blending\", and they didn't include support for add, modulate, and the other standard blending modes. No relevant company had made that mistake in a decade, and Nintendo's consoles have always done it right since the U64, so it was a surprise to see it in the DS. Additive blending in particular is crucial to most \"3D flash\" sorts of rendering, and various non-additive modulation modes are used for light mapping and other core rendering features.\n\nI only got to spend four days actually writing all the 3D code for Orcs&Elves, so there are lots of potential directions that I am interested in exploring in the future. We plan to have two more DS projects in development next year, which I hope will let me try out a skeletal animation system, experiment with the networking hardware, and implement a more flexible high level culling algorithm than what I used in O&E.\n\nJohn Carmack"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 1238040000, "contents": "iPhone development: Wolfenstein 3D Classic\n\nSource: http://www.idsoftware.com/wolfenstein3dclassic/wolfdevelopment.htm\n\nI had been frustrated for over a year with the fact that we didn't have any iPhone development projects going internally at Id.  I love my iPhone, and I think the App Store is an extremely important model for the software business.  Unfortunately, things have conspired against us being out early on the platform.\n\nRobert Duffy and I spent a week early on starting to bring up the Orcs & Elves DS codebase on the iPhone, which would have been a nice project for a launch title, but it wasn't going to be a slam dunk.  The iPhone graphics hardware is a more capable superset of the DS hardware (the driver overhead is far, far worse, though), but the codebase was fairly DS specific, with lots of Nintendo API calls all over the place.  I got the basics drawing by converting things to OpenGL ES, but I was still on the fence as to whether the best approach to get all the picky little special effects working would be a complete GL conversion, or a DS graphics library emulation layer.  Coupled with the fact that the entire user interface would need to be re-thought and re-tested, it was clear that the project would take several months of development time, and need artists and designers as well as coding work.  I made the pitch that this would still be a good plan, but the idMobile team was already committed to the Wolfenstein RPG project for conventional Java and BREW mobile phones, and Anna didn't want to slip a scheduled milestone on the established, successful development directions there for a speculative iPhone project.\n\nAfter thinking about the platform's capabilities a bit more, I had a plan for an aggressive, iPhone specific project that we actually started putting some internal resources on, but the programmer tasked with it didn't work out and was let go.  In an odd coincidence, an outside development team came to us with a proposal for a similar project on the Wii, and we decided to have them work on the iPhone project with us instead.  We should be announcing this project soon, and it is cool.  It is also late, but that's software development...\n\nLate last year, the mobile team had finished up all the planned versions of Wolfenstein RPG, but EA had suggested that in addition to the hundreds of customized versions they normally produce for all the various mobile phones, they were interested in having another team do a significant media quality improvement on it for the iPhone.  While Wolf RPG is a very finely crafted product for traditional cell phones, it wasn't designed for the iPhone's interface or capabilities, so it wouldn't be an ideal project, but it should still be worth doing.  When we got the first build to test, I was pleased with how the high res artwork looked, but I was appalled at how slow it ran.  It felt like one of the mid range java versions, not better than the high end BREW as I expected.  I started to get a sinking feeling.  I searched around in the level for a view that would confirm my suspicion, and when I found a clear enough view of some angled geometry I saw the tell-tale mid-polygon affine swim in the texture as I rotated.  They were using the software rasterizer on the iPhone.  I patted myself on the back a bit for the fact that the combination of my updated mobile renderer, the intelligent level design / restricted movement, and the hi-res artwork made the software renderer almost visually indistinguishable from a hardware renderer, but I was very unhappy about the implementation.\n\nI told EA that we were NOT going to ship that as the first Id Software product on the iPhone.  Using the iPhone's hardware 3D acceleration was a requirement, and it should be easy -- when I did the second generation mobile renderer (written originally in java) it was layered on top of a class I named TinyGL that did the transform / clip / rasterize operations fairly close to OpenGL semantics, but in fixed point and with both horizontal and vertical rasterization options for perspective correction.  The developers came back and said it would take two months and exceed their budget.\n\nRather than having a big confrontation over the issue, I told them to just send the project to me and I would do it myself.  Cass Everitt had been doing some personal work on the iPhone, so he helped me get everything set up for local iPhone development here, which is a lot more tortuous than you would expect from an Apple product.  As usual, my off the cuff estimate of \"Two days!\" was optimistic, but I did get it done in four, and the game is definitely more pleasant at 8x the frame rate. \n\nAnd I had fun doing it.\n\nSince we now were doing something resembling \"real work\" on the iPhone at the office, we kept it going at a low priority.  One of the projects Cass was tinkering around with at home was a port of Quake 3, and we talked about different interface strategies every now and then. \n\nUnfortunately, when we sat down to try a few things out, we found that Q3 wasn't really running fast enough to make good judgments on iPhone control systems.  The hardware should be capable enough, but it will take some architectural changes to the rendering code to get the most out of it.\n\nI was just starting to set up a framework to significantly revise Q3 when I considered the possibility of just going to an earlier codebase to experiment with initially.  If we wanted to factor performance out of the equation, we could go all the way back to Wolfenstein 3D, the grandfather of FPS games.  It had the basic run and gun play that has been built on for fifteen years, but it originally ran on 286 computers, so it should be pretty trivial to hold a good framerate on the iPhone.\n\nWolfenstein was originally written in Borland C and TASM for DOS, but I had open sourced the code long ago, and there were several projects that had updated the original code to work on OpenGL and modern operating systems.  After a little looking around, I found Wolf3D Redux at http://wolf3dredux.sourceforge.net/.  One of the development comments about \"removal of the gangrenous 16 bit code\" made me smile.\n\nIt was nice and simple to download, extract data from a commercial copy of Wolfenstein, and start playing on a PC at high resolution.  Things weren't as smooth as they should be at first, but two little changes made a huge difference -- going at VBL synced update rates with one tic per cycle instead of counting milliseconds to match 70 hz game tics, and fixing a bug with premature integralization in the angle update code that caused mouse movement to be notchier than it should be.  The game was still fun to play after all these years, and I began to think that it might be worthwhile to actually make a product out of Wolfenstein on the iPhone, rather than just using it as a testbed, assuming the controls worked out as fun to play.  The simple episodic nature of the game would make it easy to split up into a $0.99 version with just the first episode, a more expensive version with all sixty levels, and we could release Spear of Destiny if there was additional demand.  I was getting a little ahead of myself without a fun-to-play demonstration of feasibility on the iPhone, but the idea of moving the entire line of classic Id titles over -- Wolf, Doom, Quake, Quake 2, and Quake Arena, was starting to sound like a real good idea.\n\nI sent an email to the Wolf 3D Redux project maintainer to see if he might be interested in working on an iPhone project with us, but it had been over a year since the last update, and he must have moved on to other things.  I thought about it a bit, and decided that I would go ahead and do the project myself.  The \"big projects\" at Id are always top priority, but the systems programming work in Rage is largely completed, and the team hasn't been gated on me for anything in a while.  There is going to be memory and framerate optimization  work going on until it ships, but I decided that I could spend a couple weeks away from Rage to work on the iPhone exclusively.  Cass continued to help with iPhone system issues, I drafted Eric Will to create the few new art assets, and Christian Antkow did the audio work, but this was the first time I had taken full responsibility for an entire product in a very long time.\n\n@Design notes@\n\nThe big question was how \"classic\" should we leave the game?  I have bought various incarnations of Super Mario Bros on at least four Nintendo platforms, so I think there is something to be said for the classics, but there were so many options for improvement.  The walls and sprites in the game were originally all 64 x 64 x 8 bit color, and the sound effects were either 8khz / 8 bit mono or (sometimes truly awful) FM synth sounds.  Changing these would be trivial from a coding standpoint.  In the end, I decided to leave the game media pretty much unchanged, but tweak the game play a little bit, and build a new user framework around the core play experience.  This decision was made a lot easier by the fact that we were right around the 10 meg over-the-air app download limit with the converted media.  This would probably be the only Id project to ever be within hailing distance of that mark, so we should try to fit it in.\n\nThe original in-game status bar display had to go, because the user's thumbs were expected to cover much of that area.  We could have gone with just floating stats, but I thought that BJ's face added a lot of personality to the game, so I wanted to leave that in the middle of the screen.  Unfortunately, the way the weapon graphics were drawn, especially the knife, caused issues if they were just drawn above the existing face graphics.  I had a wider background created for the face, and used the extra space for directional damage indicators, which was a nice improvement in the gameplay.  It was a tough decision to stop there on damage feedback, because a lot of little things with view roll kicks, shaped screen blends, and even double vision or blurring effects, are all pretty easy to add and quite effective, but getting farther away from \"classic\".\n\nI started out with an explicit \"open door\" button like the original game, but I quickly decided to just make that automatic.  Wolf and Doom had explicit \"use\" buttons, but we did away with them on Quake with contact or proximity activation on everything.  Modern games have generally brought explicit activation back by situationally overriding attack, but hunting for push walls in Wolf by shooting every tile wouldn't work out.  There were some combat tactics involving explicitly shutting doors that are gone with automatic-use, and some secret push walls are trivially found when you pick up an item in front of them now, but this was definitely the right decision.\n\nYou could switch weapons in Wolf, but almost nobody actually did, except for occasionally conserving ammo with the chain gun, or challenges like \"beat the game with only the knife\".  That functionality didn't justify the interface clutter.\n\nThe concept of \"lives\" was still in wolf, with 1-ups and extras at certain scores.  We ditched that in Doom, which was actually sort of innovative at the time, since action games on computers and consoles were still very much take-the-quarter arcade oriented.  I miss the concept of \"score\" in a lot of games today, but I think the finite and granular nature of the enemies, tasks, and items in Wolf is better suited to end-of-level stats, so I removed both lives and score, but added persistent awards for par time, 100% kills, 100% secrets, and 100% treasures.  The award alone wasn't enough incentive to make treasures relevant, so I turned them into uncapped +1 health crumbs, which makes you always happy to find them.\n\nI increased the pickup radius for items, which avoided the mild frustration of having to sometimes make a couple passes at an item when you are cleaning up a room full of stuff.\n\nI doubled the starting ammo on a fresh level start.  If a player just got killed, it isn't good to frustrate them even more with a severe ammo conservation constraint.  There was some debate about the right way to handle death:  respawn with the level as is (good in that you can keep making progress if you just get one more shot off each time, bad in that weapon pickups are no longer available), respawn just as you entered the level (good -- keep your machinegun / chaingun, bad -- you might have 1 health), or, what I chose, restart the map with basic stats just as if you had started the map from the menu.\n\nThere are 60 levels in the original Wolf dataset, and I wanted people to have the freedom to easily jump around between different levels and skills, so there is no enforcement of starting at the beginning.  The challenge is to /complete /a level, not /get to/ a level.  It is fun to start filling in the grid of level completions and awards, and it often feels better to try a different level after a death.  The only exception to the start-anywhere option is that you must find the entrance to the secret levels before you can start a new game there.\n\nIn watching the early testers, the biggest issue I saw was people sliding off doors before they opened, and having to maneuver back around to go through.  In Wolf, as far as collision detection was concerned, everything was just a 64x64 tile map that was either solid or passable. \n\nDoors changed the tile state when they completed opening or began closing.  There was discussion about magnetizing the view angle towards doors, or somehow beveling the areas around the doors, but it turned out to be pretty easy to make the door tiles only have a solid central core against the player, so players would slide into the \"notch\" with the door until it opened.  This made a huge improvement in playability.\n\nThere is definitely something to be said for a game that loads in a few seconds, with automatic save of your position when you exit.  I did a lot of testing by playing the game, exiting to take notes in the iPhone notepad, then restarting Wolf to resume playing.  Not having to skip through animated logos at the start is nice.  We got this pretty much by accident with the very small and simple nature of Wolf, but I think it is worth specifically optimizing for in future titles.\n\nThe original point of this project was to investigate FPS control schemes for the iPhone, and a lot of testing was done with different schemes and parameters.  I was sort of hoping that there would be one \"obviously correct\" way to control it, but it doesn't turn out to be the case.\n\nFor a casual first time player, it is clearly best to have a single forward / back / turn control stick and a fire button.\n\nTilt control is confusing for first exposure to the game, but I think it does add to the fun factor when you use it.  I like the tilt-to-move option, but people that play a lot of driving games on the iPhone seem to like tilt-to-turn, where you are sort of driving BJ through the levels.  Tilt needs a decent deadband, and a little bit of filtering is good.  I was surprised that the precision on the accelerometer was only a couple degrees, which makes it poorly suited for any direct mapped usage, but it works well enough as a relative speed control.\n\nSerious console gamers tend to take to the \"dual stick\" control modes easily for movement, but the placement of the fire button is problematic.  Using an index finger to fire is effective but uncomfortable.  I see many players just move the thumb to fire, using strafe movement for fine tuning aim.  It is almost tempting to try to hijack the side volume switch for fire, but the ergonomics aren't quite right, and it would be very un-Apple-like, and wouldn't be available on the iPod touch (plus I couldn't figure out how...).\n\nWe tried a tilt-forward to fire to allow you to keep your thumbs on the dual control sticks, but it didn't work out very well.  Forward / back tilt has the inherent variable holding angle problem for anything, and a binary transition point is hard for people to hold without continuous feedback.  Better visual feedback on the current angle and trip point would help, but we didn't pursue it much.  For a game with just, say, a rocket launcher, shake/shove-to-fire might be interesting, but it isn't any good for wolf.\n\nIt was critical for the control sticks to be analog, since digital direction pads have proven quite ineffective on touch screens due to progressive lack of registration during play.  With an analog stick, the player has continuous visual feedback of the stick position in most cases, so they can self correct.  Tuning the deadband and slide off behavior are important.\n\nLevel design criteria has advanced a lot since Wolfenstein, but I wasn't going to open up the option of us modifying the levels, even though the start of the first level is painfully bad for a first time player, with the tiny, symmetric rooms for them to get their nose mashed into walls and turned around in.  The idea is that you started the game in a prison cell after bashing your guard over the head, but even with the exact same game tools, we would lead the player through the experience much better now.  Some of the levels are still great fun to play, and it is interesting to read Tom Hall and John Romero's designer notes in the old hint manuals, but the truth is that some levels were scrubbed out in only a couple hours, unlike the long process of testing and adjustment that goes on today.\n\nIt was only after I thought I was basically done with the game that Tim Willits pointed out the elephant in the gameplay room -- for 95% of players, wandering around lost in a maze isn't very much fun. \n\nImplementing an automap was pretty straightforward, and it probably added more to the enjoyment of the game than anything else.  Before adding this, I thought that only a truly negligible amount of people would actually finish all 60 levels, but now I think there might be enough people that get through them to justify bringing the Spear of Destiny levels over later.\n\nWhen I was first thinking about the project I sort of assumed that we wouldn't bother with music, but Wolf3D Redux already had code that converted the old id music format into ogg, so we would up with support at the beginning, and it turned out pretty good.  We wound up ripping the red book audio tracks from one of the later commercial Wolf releases and encoding at a different bitrate, but I probably wouldn't have bothered if not for the initial support.  It would have been nice to re-record the music with a high quality MIDI synth, but we didn't have the original MIDI source, and Christian said that the conversion back from the id music format to midi was a little spotty, and would take a fair amount of work to get right.  I emailed Bobby Prince, the original composer, to see if he had any high quality versions still around, but he didn't get back with me.\n\nThe game is definitely simplistic by modern standards, but it still has its moments.  Getting the drop on a brown shirt just as he is pulling his pistol from the holster.  Making an SS do the \"twitchy dance\" with your machine gun.  Rounding a corner and unloading your weapon on ... a potted plant.  Simplistic plays well on the iPhone. \n\n@Programming notes@\n\nCass and I got the game running on the iPhone very quickly, but I was a little disappointed that various issues around the graphics driver, the input processing, and the process scheduling meant that doing a locked-at-60-hz game on the iPhone wasn't really possible.  I hope to take these up with Apple at some point in the future, but it meant that Wolf would be a roughly two tick game.  It is only \"roughly\" because there is no swapinterval support, and the timer scheduling has a lot of variability in it.  It doesn't seem to matter all that much, the play is still smooth and fun, but I would have liked to at least contrast it with the perfect limit case.\n\nIt turns out that there were a couple issues that required work even at 30hz.  For a game like Wolf, any PC that is in use today is essentially infinitely fast, and the Wolf3D Redux code did some things that were convenient but wasteful.  That is often exactly the right thing to do, but the iPhone isn't quite as infinitely fast as a desktop PC.\n\nWolfenstein (and Doom) originally drew the characters as sparse stretched columns of solid pixels (vertical instead of horizontal for efficiency in interleaved planar mode-X VGA), but OpenGL versions need to generate a square texture with transparent pixels.  Typically this is then drawn by either alpha blending or alpha testing a big quad that is mostly empty space.  You could play through several early levels of Wolf without this being a problem, but in later levels there are often large fields of dozens of items that stack up to enough overdraw to max out the GPU and drop the framerate to 20 fps.  The solution is to bound the solid pixels in the texture and only draw that restricted area, which solves the problem with most items, but Wolf has a few different heavily used ceiling lamp textures that have a small lamp at the top and a thin but full width shadow at the bottom.  A single bounds doesn't exclude many texels, so I wound up including two bounds, which made them render many times faster.\n\nThe other problem was CPU related.  Wolf3d Redux used the original ray casting scheme to find out which walls were visible, then called a routine to draw each wall tile with OpenGL calls.  The code looked something like this:\n\n[code]DrawWall( int wallNum ) {\n   char   name[128];\n   texture_t   *tex;\n   sprintf( name, \"walls/%d.tga\", wallNum );\n   tex = FindTexture( name );\n   ...\n}\ntexture_t FindTexture( const char *name ) {\n   int   i;\n   for ( i = 0 ; i < numTextures ; i++ ) {\n      if ( !strcmp( name, texture[name]->name ) ) {\n         return texture[name];\n      }\n   }\n   ...\n} [/code]\n\nI winced when I saw that at the top of the instruments profile, but again, you could play all the early levels that only had twenty or thirty visible tiles at a time without it actually being a problem.  However, some later levels with huge open areas could have over a hundred visible tiles, and that led to 20hz again.  The solution was a trivial change to something resembling:\n\n[code]DrawWall( int wallNum ) {\n   texture_t   *tex = wallTextures[wallNum];\n   ...\n} [/code]\n\nWolf3D Redux included a utility that extracted the variously packed media from the original games and turned them into cleaner files with modern formats.  Unfortunately, an attempt at increasing the quality of the original art assets by using hq2x graphics scaling to turn the 64x64 art into better filtered 128x128 arts was causing lots of sprites to have fringes around them due to incorrect handling of alpha borders.  It wasn't possible to fix it up at load time, so I had to do the proper outline-with-color-but-0-alpha operations in a modified version of the extractor.  I also decided to do all the format conversion and mip generation there, so there was no significant CPU time spent during texture loading, helping to keep the load time down.  I experimented with the PVRTC formats, but while it would have been ok for the walls, unlike with DXT you can't get a lossless alpha mask out of it, so it wouldn't have worked for the sprites.  Besides, you really don't want to mess with the carefully chosen pixels in a 64x64 block very much when you scale it larger than the screen on occasion.\n\nI also had to make one last minute hack change to the original media -- the Red Cross organization had asserted their trademark rights over red crosses (sigh) some time after we released the original Wolfenstein 3D game, and all new game releases must not use red crosses on white backgrounds as health symbols.  One single, solitary sprite graphic got modified for this release.\n\nUser interface code was the first thing I started making other programmers do at Id when I no longer had to write every line of code in a project, because I usually find it tedious and unrewarding.  This was such a small project that I went ahead and did it myself, and I learned an interesting little thing.  Traditionally, UI code has separate drawing and input processing code, but on a touchscreen device, it often works well to do a combined \"immediate mode interface\", with code like this: \n\n[code]if ( DrawPicWithTouch( x, y, w, h, name ) ) {\n\tmenuState = newState;\n} [/code]\n\nDoing that for the floating user gameplay input controls would introduce a frame of response latency, but for menus and such, it works very well.\n\nOne of the worst moments during the development was when I was getting ready to hook up the automatic savegame on app exit.  There wasn't any savegame code.  I went back and grabbed the original 16 bit dos code for load / save game, but when I compiled I found out that the Wolf3d Redux codebase had changed a lot more than just the near / far pointer issues, asm code, and comment blocks.  The changes were sensible things, like grouping more variables into structures and defining enums for more things, but it did mean that I wasn't dealing with the commercially tested core that I thought I was.  It also meant that I was a lot more concerned about a strange enemy lerping through the world bug I had seen a couple times.\n\nI seriously considered going back to the virgin codebase and reimplementing the OpenGL rendering from scratch.  The other thing that bothered me about the Redux codebase was that it was basically a graft of the Wolf3D code into the middle of a gutted Quake 2 codebase.  This was cool in some ways, because it gave us a console, cvars, and the system / OpenGL portable framework, and it was clear the original intention was to move towards multiplayer functionality, but it was a lot of bloat.  The original wolf code was only a few dozen C files, while the framework around it here was several times that.\n\nLooking through the original code brought back some memories.  I stopped signing code files years ago, but the top of WL_MAIN.C made me smile:\n\n[code]/*\n=============================================================================\n\nWOLFENSTEIN 3-D\n\nAn Id Software production\n\nby John Carmack\n\n=============================================================================\n*/ [/code]\n\nIt wasn't dated, but that would have been in 1991.\n\nIn the end, I decided to stick with the Redux codebase, but I got a lot more free with hacking big chunks of it out.  I reimplemented load / save game (fixing the inevitable pointer bugs involved), and by littering asserts throughout the code, I tracked the other problem down to an issue with making a signed comparison against one of the new enum types that compare as unsigned.  I'm still not positive if this was the right call, since the codebase is sort of a mess with lots of vestigial code that doesn't really do anything, and I don't have time to clean it all up right now.\n\nOf course, someone else is welcome to do that.  The full source code for the commercial app is available on the web site.  There was a little thought given to the fact that if I had reverted to the virgin source, the project wouldn't be required to be under the GPL.  Wolf and the app store presents a sort of unique situation -- a user can't just compile the code and choose not to pay for the app, because most users aren't registered developers, and the data isn't readily available, but there is actually some level of commercial risk in the fast-moving iPhone development community.  It will not be hard to take the code that is already fun to play, pull a bunch of fun things off the net out of various projects people have done with the code over the years, dust off some old map editors, and load up with some modern quality art and sound.\n\nEveryone is perfectly within their rights to go do that, and they can aggressively try to bury the original game if they want.  However, I think there is actually a pretty good opportunity for cooperation.  If anyone makes a quality product and links to the original Wolf app, we can start having links to \"wolf derived\" or \"wolf related\" projects. \n\nThat should turn out to be a win for everyone.\n\nI'm going back to Rage for a while, but I do expect Classic Doom to come fairly soon for the iPhone.\n"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 1240804800, "contents": "iPhone development: Doom Classic Progress Report\n\nSource: http://www.idsoftware.com/iphone-doom-classic-progress/\n\nI have been spending the majority of my time working on iPhone Doom Classic for several weeks now, and the first beta build went out to some external testers a couple days ago. I am moving back on to Rage for a while, but I expect to be able to finish it up for submission to the App Store next month.\n\nWolfenstein 3D Classic was a quickie project to satisfy my curiosity and test the iPhone waters, but Doom is a more serious effort. In addition to the millions of people with fond memories of the game, there is still an active gaming / development community surrounding the original Doom, and I don't want to disappoint any of them.\n\nOne of the things I love about open sourcing the old games is that Doom has been ported to practically everything with a 32 bit processor, from toasters to supercomputers. We hear from a lot of companies that have moved the old games onto various set top boxes and PDAs, and want licenses to sell them. We generally come to some terms in the five figure range for obscure platforms, but it is always with a bit of a sigh. The game runs, and the demo playbacks look good, but there is a distinct lack of actually caring about the game play itself. Making Doom run on a new platform is only a couple days of work. Making it a really good game on a platform that doesn't have a keyboard and mouse or an excess of processing power is an honest development effort.\n\nTo my surprise, Christian was able to dig up the original high quality source material for the Doom sounds, so we have 22khz 16 bit sound effects instead of the 11khz 8 bit ones from the original game. It turns out that I can barely tell the difference, which is a sign that we made good choices way back then about catering the sounds to the output device. If we were on the fence for any resource limits, I would have considered sticking with the originals, but the current OpenAL mixer code has errors with 8 bit source buffers, so I would have had to convert to 16 bit at load time anyway, and just referencing the high quality source media actually speeds up the load times.\n\nThe music is all stored as mp3, performed on a high quality synthesizer. For Wolf, we used ogg, because that's what was in the Redux codebase that I started with, but I don't have all that CPU performance margin anymore, so it was necessary to use the iPhone's audio decompression hardware through the AudioQueue services. The music is the largest part of the application, but everything else is still well over the 10 meg cellular app transfer limit, so I'm not tempted to try and squeeze it under like we did with Wolfenstein. Maybe being able to get an app over 3G really isn't very important to its success. The fact that people are downloading Myst on the iPhone is heartening -- I have ideas for leveraging our high end idTech-5 content creation pipeline for a future iPhone game, if people will go for a few hundred meg download.\n\nThe toughest question was the artwork. Since Wolf was selling well, I had planned on paying contractors to upscale all the Doom graphics to twice the original resolution. When I pulled all the graphics out and tallied it all up, it looked a lot more marginal than I had expected. There were over two thousand individual pieces of art, and it was over ten megatexels in exactly bounded area, let alone atlas fit or power of two inset. The PVRTC compressed formats would work great for the floors and ceilings, which are all nice 64x64 blocks, but it has issues for both the walls and floors.\n\nPVRTC textures must be power of two and, notably, square. If you want a 256 x 512 texture that needs to repeat in both axis, you need to resample it to 512 x 512 to use PVRTC, which means you lose half your compression benefit and get distorted filter kernels and mip level selections. Even worse, Doom had the concept of composited walls, where a surface was generated by adding, say, a switch texture on top of a wall texture. You can't do that sort of operation with PVRTC images. The clean sheet of paper solution to both problems is to design around textures that the hardware likes and use more geometry where you need to tile or combine them, but Doom wasn't well suited to that approach.\n\nCharacter sprites don't get repeated, so a lot of them can be packed into a nice square 1024 x 1024 texture to minimize waste, but the PVRTC texture formats aren't well suited to sprite graphics. The DXT1 compression format has an exact bit mask for the alpha channel, which is what you want for an application like this. PVRTC treats alpha like any other color channel, so you get coupling between the alpha and color channels that results in partially transparent pixels ringing outside the desired character boundary. It works fine for things like clouds or fireballs, but not so good for character sprites. It looks like it should be possible to get an exact binary mask with the 2 bit PVRTC mode, which could be combined with a 4 bit PVRTC color texture to get a 6 bpp perfectly outlined sprite, but the multitexture performance on the iPhone, even with PVRTC textures, is not fast enough to prevent missing 30 fps when you have a hoard of monsters in front of you.\n\nWe started to do some internal samples of up-scaled artwork to use as reference for getting the contractor quotes, and it just wasn't looking all that spectacular. Doubling the art and smoothing out the edges wasn't buying much. There was certainly a lot of room for improvement, since Doom was designed around a 256 color palette with a limited selection of intensity ramps for lighting, but moving there from the starting point would be tricky. If I went to one of our artists today and asked them to draw a bad-ass Baron of Hell throwing a fireball in a 256 x 256 x 16 bit block, I would get something a LOT better than the original art, but it would look different, not just better.\n\nI was also a little taken aback by some of the backlash against the updated graphics that I put in for Wolf 1.1. I took the walls, guns, and decorative sprites from the Mac version of Wolfenstein, and had Eric use that as source to recreate some similar graphics that weren't present in the Mac version. After release, there were a number of reviews that complained, saying that it \"ruined the classic feel\". I have a couple thoughts abut this: Changing the look on a point release is going to cause some level of complaint, so it is probably a good idea to make any changes from \" classic\" you think you might want in version 1.0. I also believe most of the complaints were due to the view weapons. The original gun artwork wasn't great, but the double-res ones weren't very good either, and they were a bit different looking. I debated with myself a bit about using them at all, and it looks like I probably shouldn't have. I can't see any drawback whatsoever to the double res walls and sprites, since they are in the same style, just better looking when you jam your face up against them.\n\nIn the end, I decided not to do anything with the DOOM source art. With the GPU accelerated filtering and 24 bit lighting it looks a lot better than it ever did, and with floors, ceilings, and lighting you don't seem to notice the low resolution as much as with Wolf.\n\nWith the speed (a solid 30 fps, even in the more aggressive later levels), the audio, the resolution, and the rendering quality, it is Doom as you remember it, which is quite a bit better than it actually was. If you go back and play the original game on a 386 with a sound blaster, you will be surprised at the 15 fps, FM-synth music, \"bathroom tile sized\" 320 x 200 pixels, external network game setup utility, and external keyboard configuration. A lot of people remember it as \"The best game EVER!\", but \"ever\" has sure moved a lot in the last decade!\n\nBefore I actually started coding on the project, I had visions of adding a lot of modern tuned effects to the core gameplay experience. It would certainly stay a sprite-and-sector based game, but there are many things that would be done differently with the benefit of a GPU and the wisdom of hindsight. Once I began actually working on it, it started to look like a bad idea for a number of reasons. I am trying to not be very disruptive in the main codebase, because I want it to stay a part of http://prboom.sourceforge.net/ instead of being another codebase fork. While I can certainly add a bunch of new features fairly quickly, iterating through a lot of user testing and checking for problems across the >100 commercial Doom levels would take a lot longer. There really is value in \" classic\" in this case, and there would be some degree of negative backlash to almost any \"improvements\" I made. There will still be a couple tiny tweaks, but nothing radical is changing in the basic play. It would be fun to take a small team, permanently fork it, and make a \"Doom++\" just for the iPhone, but that wouldn't be the best first move. Maybe later.\n\nThe iPhone interface around the game is all done nicely. Wolf Classic got dinged a bit for the blocky look of the buttons and interface components. I didn't actually see any complaints about the crappy monospace font, but it deserved some. Everything looks good now.\n\nThe initial release will be for OS 2.x, and support multiplayer over WiFi. A later release will be for 3.x only, and support bluetooth multiplayer. I looked into the possibility of 3G multiplayer, but the latencies just aren't good enough -- I see 380 or so pings from my phone to local servers. This was interesting, because I have talked to other hardware vendors that claim 3G latencies of half that. I'm not sure if there are issues with the iPhone, issues with AT&T's network in Dallas, or if the vendor was just mistaken about what they were getting. One anecdotal report is that iPhones work better in Japan than here, so it may be infrastructure.\n\nI will probably have another update later with more technical details about the logic behind the new rendering architecture (rewritten for > 2x the speed of the original prBoom GL renderer), touch control issues, and so on.\n"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 1243396800, "contents": "iPhone development: Doom Classic Progress Report\n\nSource: http://www.idsoftware.com/iphone-doom-classic-progress/\n\nI have been spending the majority of my time working on iPhone Doom Classic for several weeks now, and the first beta build went out to some external testers a couple days ago.

After Doom Resurrection had its time in the sun, I was prepared to put the rest of the work into Doom Classic, but we ran into another schedule conflict.  As I related in my Wolf Classic notes http://www.idsoftware.com/wolfenstein-3d-classic-platinum/wolfdevelopment.htm , Wolfenstein RPG for the iPhone was actually done before Wolfenstein Classic, but EA had decided to sit on it until the release of the big PC / console Wolfenstein game in August.\n\nI really thought I was going to go back and finish things up in September, but I got crushingly busy on other fronts.  In an odd little bit of serendipity, after re-immersing myself in the original Doom for the iPhone, I am now working downstairs at Id with the Doom 4 team.  I'm calling my time a 50/50 split between Rage and Doom 4, but the stress doesn't divide.  September was also the month that Armadillo Aerospace flew the level 2 Lunar Lander Challenge:\n\nhttp://www.armadilloaerospace.com/n.x/Armadillo/Home/News?news_id=368\n\nFinally, in October I SWORE I would finish it, and we aimed for a Halloween release.  We got it submitted in plenty of time, but we ran into a couple approval hiccups that caused it to run to the very last minute.  The first was someone incorrectly thinking that the \"Demos\" button that played back recorded demos from the game, was somehow providing demo content for other commercial products, which is prohibited.  The second issue was the use of an iPhone image in the multiplayer button, which we had to make a last minute patch for.\n\n@Release notes@\n\nOk, the game is finally out (the GPL source code is being packaged up for release today).  Based on some review comments, there are a couple clarifications to be made:\n\nMultiplayer requires a WiFi connection that doesn't have UDP port 14666 blocked.  I'm quite happy with the simple and fast multiplayer setup, but it seems like many access points just dump the packets in the trash.  If the multiplayer button on the main menu doesn't start pulsing for additional players after the first player has hit it, you won't be able to connect.  I have also seen a network where the button would pulse, but the player would never get added to the player list, which meant that somehow the DNS packets were getting through, but the app packets weren't.  It works fine on a normal AirPort install...  More on networking below.\n\nI took out tilt-to-turn just to free up some interface screen space, because I didn't know anyone that liked that mode, and my query thread on Touch Arcade didn't turn up people that would miss it a lot. \n\nEvidently there are a few people that do care a lot, so we will cram that back in on the next update.  The functionality is still there without a user interface, so you can enable it by four-finger-tapping to bring up the keyboard and typing \"tiltturn 4000\" or some number like that, and it will stay set.  Make sure you have tiltmove pulled down to 0.  I never got around to putting in a real console, but you can change a few parameters like that, as well as enter all the original doom cheat codes like IDDQD, IDKFA, etc.\n\nI think that the auto-centering control sticks in Doom Classic are a better control scheme than the fixed sticks from Wolf Classic.  The advice for wolf was to adjust the stick positions so that your thumbs naturally fell in the center point, so I just made that automatic for Doom.  Effective control always involved sliding your thumbs on the screen, rather than discretely tapping it, and this mode forces you to do that from the beginning. Still, even if the new mode is some fraction \"better\", there are a lot of people who have logged a lot of hours in Wolfenstein Classic, and any change at all will be a negative initially.  In the options->settings menu screen, there is a button labeled \"Center sticks: ON\" that can be toggled off to keep the sticks fixed in place like in Wolf.\n\nA subtle difference is that the turning sensitivity is now graded so that a given small movement will result in a specific percentage increase in speed, no matter where in the movement range it is.  With linear sensitivity, if you are 10 pixels off from the center and you move your thumb 10 pixels farther, then the speed exactly doubles.  If you are 50 pixels off from the center, the same 10 pixel move only increases your turning rate by 20%.  With ramped sensitivity, you would get a 20% (depending on the sensitivity scale) increase in speed in both cases, which tends to be better for most people.  You can disable this by toggling the \"Ramp turn: ON\" option off.\n\nIn hindsight, I should have had a nice obvious button on the main options screen that said \"Wolfenstein Style\" and had the same options, but I have always had difficult motivating myself to do good backwards compatibility engineering.  Even then, the movement speeds are different between the games, so it wouldn't have felt exactly the same.\n\nIt was a lot of fun to do this project, working on it essentially alone, as a contrast to the big teams on the major internal projects.  I was still quite pleased with how the look and feel of the game holds up after so long, especially the \"base style\" levels.  The \"hell levels\" show their age a lot more, where the designers were really reaching beyond what the technology could effectively provide.\n\n@Future iPhone work@\n\nWe do read all the reviews in the App store, and we do plan on supporting Doom Classic with updates.  Everything is still an experiment for us on the iPhone, and we are learning lessons with each product.  At this point, we do not plan on making free lite versions of future products, since we didn't notice anything worth the effort with Wolfenstein, and other developers have reported similar findings.\n\nWe have two people at Id that are going to be dedicated to iPhone work.  I doubt I will be able to personally open Xcode again for a few months, but I do plan on trying to work out a good touch interface for Quake Classic and the later 6DOF games.  I also very much want to make at least a tech demo that can run media created with a version of our idTech 5 megatexture content creation pipeline.  I'm not sure exactly what game I would like to do with it, so it might be a 500 mb free gee-whiz app...\n\nWolfenstein Classic Platinum was a break-in opportunity for the new internal iPhone developers.  We were originally planning on making the Spear of Destiny levels available as in-app purchased content.  Then we decided to make it a separate \"Platinum Edition\" application at a reasonable price.  Finally, we decided that we would just make it a free update, but something has gone wrong during this process -- people who buy the app for the first time get everything working properly, but many people who upgrade the App from a previous purchase are seeing lots of things horribly broken.  We are working with Apple to try to debug and fix this, but the workaround is to uninstall the app completely, then reload it.  The exciting thing about Wolf Platinum is the support for downloadable levels, which is the beta test for future game capabilities.  Using a URL to specify downloadable content for apps is a very clean way to interface to the game through a web page or email message.\n\nThe idMobile team is finishing up the last of the BREW versions of Doom 2 RPG, and work has started on an iPhone specific version, similar to the Wolfenstein RPG release.  The real-time FPS games are never going to be enjoyable for a lot of people, and the turn based RPG games are pretty neat in many regards.  If they are well received, we will probably bring over the Orcs&Elves games as well.\n\nI want to work on a Rage themed game to coincide with Rage's release, but we don't have a firm direction or team chosen for it.  I was very excited about doing a really-designed-for-the-iPhone first person shooter, but at this point I am positive that I don't have the time available for it.\n\n@Networking techie stuff@\n\nI doubt one customer in ten will actually play a network game of Doom Classic, but it was interesting working on it.\n\nWay back in March when I was first starting the work, I didn't want the game to require 3.0 to run, and I generally try to work with the lowest level interfaces possible for performance critical systems, so I wasn't looking at GameKit for multiplayer.  I was hoping that it was possible to use BSD sockets to allow both WiFi networking on 2.0 devices and WiFi or ad-hoc bluetooth on 3.0 devices.  It turns out that it is possible, but it wasn't documented as such anywhere I could find.\n\nI very much approve of Apple's strategy of layering Obj-C frameworks on top of Unix style C interfaces.  Bonjour is a layer over DNS, and GameKit uses sockets internally.  The only bit of obscure magic that goes on is that the bluetooth IP interface only comes into existence after you have asked DNS to resolve a service that was reported for it.  Given this, there is no getting around using DNS for initial setup. \n\nWith WiFi, you could still use your own broadcast packets to do player finding and stay completely within the base sockets interfaces, and this might even make some sense, considering that there appear to be some WiFi access points that will report a DNS service's existence that your app can't actually talk to.\n\nFor every platform I have done networking on previously, you could pretty much just assume that you had the loopback interface and an Ethernet interface, and you could just use INADDR_ANY for pretty much everything.  Multiple interfaces used to just be an issue for big servers, but the iPhone can have a lot of active interfaces -- loopback, WiFi Ethernet, Bluetooth Ethernet, and several point to point interfaces for the cellular data networks.\n\nAt first, I was excited about the possibility of multiplayer over 3G.  I had been told by someone at Intel that they were seeing ping times of 180 ms on 3G devices, which could certainly be made to work for gaming. \n\nUnfortunately, my tests, here in Dallas at least, show about twice that, which isn't worth fighting.  I'm a bit curious whether they were mistaking one-way times, or if the infrastructure in California is really that much better.  In any case, that made my implementation choice clear -- local link networking only.\n\nA historical curiosity: the very first release of the original Doom game on the PC used broadcast IPX packets for LAN networking.  This seemed logical, because broadcast packets for a network game of N players has a packet count of just N packets on the network each tic, since everyone hears each packet.  The night after we released the game, I was woken up by a call from a college sysadmin yelling at me for crippling their entire network.  I didn't have an unlisted number at the time.  When I had decided to implement network gaming, I bought and read a few books, but I didn't have any practical experience, so I had thought that large networks were done like the books explained, with routers connecting independent segments.  I had no idea that there were many networks with thousands of nodes connected solely by bridges that forwarded all broadcast packets over lower bit rate links.  I quickly changed the networking to have each peer send addressed packets to the other peers.  More traffic on the local segment, but no chance of doing horrible things to bridged networks.\n\nWiFi is different from wired Ethernet in a few ways.  WiFi clients don't actually talk directly to each other, they talk to the access point, which rebroadcasts the packet to the destination, so every packet sent between two WiFi devices is actually at least two packets over the air. \n\nAn ad-hoc WiFi network would have twice the available peer to peer bandwidth and half the packet drop rate that an access point based one does.  Another point is that unlike wired Ethernet, the WiFi link level actually does packet retransmits if the destination doesn't acknowledge receipt.  They won't be retransmitted forever, and the buffer spaces are limited, so it can't be relied upon the way you do TCP, but packet drops are more rare than you would expect.  This also means that there are lots of tiny little ACK packets flying around, which contributes to reduced throughput.  Broadcast packets are in-between -- the broadcast packet is sent from the source to the access point with acknowledgment and retransmits, but since the access point can't know who it is going to, it just fires it out blind a single time.\n\nI experimentally brought the iPhone networking up initially using UDP broadcast packets, but the delivery was incredibly poor.  Very few packets were dropped, but hundreds of milliseconds could sometimes go by with no deliveries, then a huge batch would be delivered all at once.  I thought it might be a policy decision on our congested office access point, but it behaved the same way at my house on a quiet LAN, so I suspect there is an iPhone system software issue.  If I had a bit more time, I would have done comparisons with a WiFi laptop.  I had pretty much planned to use addressed packets anyway, but the broadcast behavior was interesting.\n\nDoom PC was truly peer to peer, and each client transmitted to every other client, for N * (N-1) packets every tic.  It also stalled until valid data had arrived from every other player, so adding more players hurts in two different ways -- more packets = more congestion = more likely to drop each individual packet.  The plus side of an arrangement like this is that it is truly fair, no client has any advantage over any other, even if one or more players are connected by a lower quality link.  Everyone gets the worst common denominator behavior.\n\nI settled on a packet server approach for the iPhone, since someone had to be designated a \"server\" anyway for DNS discovery, and it has the minimum non-broadcast packet count of 2N packets every tic.  Each client sends a command packet to the server each tic, the server combines all of them, then sends an addressed packet back to each client.  The remaining question was what the server should do when it hasn't received an updated command from a client.  When the server refused to send out a packet until it had received data from all clients, there was a lot more variability in the arrival rate.  It could be masked by intentionally adding some latency on each client side, but I found that it plays better to just have the server repeat the last valid command when it hasn't gotten an update.  This does mean that there is a slight performance advantage to being the server, because you will never drop an internal packet.\n\nThe client always stalls until it receives a server packet, there was no way I had the time to develop any latency reducing / drop mitigating prediction mechanisms.  There are a couple full client / server, internet capable versions of Doom available on the PC, but I wanted to work from a more traditional codebase for this project.\n\nSo, I had the game playing well over WiFi, but communication over the Bluetooth interface was significantly worse.  There was an entire frame of additional latency versus WiFi, and the user mode Bluetooth daemon was also sucking up 10% of the CPU.  That would have been livable, but there were regular surges in the packet delivery rate that made it basically unplayable.\n\nSurging implies a buffer somewhere backing up and then draining, and I had seen something similar but less damaging occasionally on WiFi as well, so I wondered if there might be some iPhone system communication going on.  I spent a little while with WireShark trying to see if the occasional latency pileup was due to actual congestion, and what was in the packets, but I couldn't get my Macbook into promiscuous WiFi mode, and I didn't have the time to configure a completely new system.\n\nIn the end, I decided to just cut out the Bluetooth networking and leave it with WiFi.  There was a geek-neatness to having a net game with one client on WiFi and another on Bluetooth, but I wasn't going to have time to wring it all out.\n"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 1288065600, "contents": "RAGE on iPhone/iPad/iPod\n\nSource: http://www.bethblog.com/index.php/2010/10/29/john-carmack-discusses-rage-on-iphoneipadipod-touch/\n\n@RAGE for iPhone@\n\nOur mobile development efforts at id took some twists and turns in the last year. The plan was always to do something RAGE-related on the iPhone/iPad/iPod touch next, but with all the big things going on at id, the mobile efforts weren\u0092t front and center on the priority list. There had been a bit of background work going on, but it was only towards the end of July that I was able to sit down and write the core engine code that would drive the project.\n\nI was excited about how well it turned out, and since this was right before QuakeCon, I broke with tradition and did a live technology demo during my keynote. In hindsight, I probably introduced it poorly. I said something like \u0093Its RAGE. On the iPhone. At 60 frames a second.\u0094  Some people took that to mean that the entire PC/console game experience was going to be on the iPhone, which is definitely not the case.\n\nWhat I showed was a technology demo, written from scratch, but using the RAGE content creation pipeline and media. We do not have the full RAGE game running on iOS, and we do not plan to try. While it would (amazingly!) actually be possible to compile the full-blown PC/console RAGE game for an iPhone4 with some effort, it would be a hopelessly bad idea. Even the latest and greatest mobile devices are still a fraction of the power of a 360 or PS3, let alone a high end gaming PC, so none of the carefully made performance tradeoffs would be appropriate for the platform, to say nothing of the vast differences in controls.\n\nWhat we do have is something unlike anything ever seen on the iOS platforms. It is glorious, and a lot of fun. Development has been proceeding at high intensity since QuakeCon, and we hope to have the app out by the end of November.\n\nThe technical decision to use our megatexture content creation pipeline for the game levels had consequences for its scope. The data required for the game is big. Really, really big. Seeing Myst do well on the iPhone with a 700 meg download gave me some confidence that users would still download huge apps, and that became the target size for our standard definition version, but the high definition version for iPad / iPhone 4 will be around twice that size. This is more like getting a movie than an app, so be prepared for a long download. Still, for perspective, the full scale RAGE game is around 20 gigs of data with JPEG-XR compression, so 0.7 gigs of non-transcoded data is obviously a tiny slice of it.\n\nSince we weren\u0092t going to be able to have lots of hugely expansive levels, we knew that there would be some disappointment if we went out at a high price point, no matter how good it looked. We have experimented with a range of price points on the iPhone titles so far, but we had avoided the very low end. We decided that this would be a good opportunity to try a  $0.99 SD / $1.99 HD price point.  We need to stay focused on not letting the project creep out of control, but I think people will be very happy with the value.\n\nThe little slice of RAGE that we decided to build the iPhone product around is \u0093Mutant Bash TV\u0094, a post apocalyptic combat game show in the RAGE wasteland. This is the perfect setup for a quintessential first person shooter game play experience \u0097 you pick your targets, aim your shots, time your reloads, dodge the bad guys, and try and make it through to the end of the level with a better score than last time. Beyond basic survival, there are pickups, head shots, and hit streak multipliers to add more options to the gameplay, and there is a broad range of skill levels available from keep-hitting-fire-and-you-should-make-it to almost-impossible.\n\nA large goal of the project has been to make sure that the levels can be replayed many times. The key is making the gamplay itself the rewarding aspect, rather than story progression, character development, or any kind of surprises. Many of the elements that made Doom Resurrection good the first time you played it hurt the replayability, for instance. RAGE iOS is all action, all the time. I have played the game dozens of times, and testing it is still fun instead of a chore.\n\n@Technical Geek Details@\n\nThe id Tech 5 engine uses a uniform paged virtual texture system for basically everything in the game. While the algorithm would be possible on 3GS and later devices, it has a substantial per-fragment processing cost, and updating individual pages in a physical texture is not possible with PVRTC format textures. The approach used for mobile RAGE is to do the texture streaming based on variable sized contiguous \u0093texture islands\u0094 in the world. This is much faster, but it forces geometric subdivision of large surfaces, and must be completely predictive instead of feedback reactive. Characters, items, and UI are traditionally textured.\n\nWe build the levels and preview them in RAGE on the PC, then run a profiling / extraction tool to generate the map data for the iOS game. This tool takes the path through the game and determines which texture islands are going to be visible, and at what resolution and orientation. The pixels for the texture island are extracted from the big RAGE page file, then anisotropically filtered into as many different versions as needed, and packed into 1024\u00d71024 textures that are PVRTC compressed for the device.\n\nThe packing into the textures has conflicting goals \u0096 to minimize total app size you want to cram texture islands in everywhere they can fit, but you also don\u0092t want to scatter the islands needed for a given view into a hundred different textures, or radically change your working set in nearby views. As with many NP complete problems, I wound up with a greedy value metric optimizing allocation strategy.\n\nManaging over a gig of media made dealing with flash memory IO and process memory management very important, and I did a lot of performance investigations to figure things out.\n\nCritically, almost all of the data is static, and can be freely discarded. iOS does not have a swapfile, so if you use too much dynamic memory, the OS gives you a warning or two, then kills your process. The bane of iOS developers is that \u0093too much\u0094 is not defined, and in fact varies based on what other apps (Safari, Mail, iPod, etc) that are in memory have done. If you read all your game data into memory, the OS can\u0092t do anything with it, and you are in danger. However, if all of your data is in a read-only memory mapped file, the OS can throw it out at will. This will cause a game hitch when you need it next, but it beats an abrupt termination. The low memory warning does still cause the frame rate to go to hell for a couple seconds as all the other apps try to discard things, even if the game doesn\u0092t do much.\n\nInterestingly, you can only memory map about 700 megs of virtual address space, which is a bit surprising for a 32 bit OS. I expected at least twice that, if not close to 3 gigs. We sometimes have a decent fraction of this mapped.\n\nA page fault to a memory mapped file takes between 1.8 ms on an iPhone 4 and 2.2 ms on an iPod 2, and brings in 32k of data. There appears to be an optimization where if you fault at the very beginning of a file, it brings in 128k instead of 32k, which has implications for file headers.\n\nI am pleased to report that fcntl( fd, F_NOCACHE ) works exactly as desired on iOS \u0096 I always worry about behavior of historic unix flags on Apple OSs. Using this and page aligned target memory will bypass the file cache and give very repeatable performance ranging from the page fault bandwidth with 32k reads up to 30 mb/s for one meg reads (22 mb/s for the old iPod). This is fractionally faster than straight reads due to the zero copy, but the important point is that it won\u0092t evict any other buffer data that may have better temporal locality. All the world megatexture data is managed with uncached reads, since I know what I need well ahead of time, and there is a clear case for eviction. When you are past a given area, those unique textures won\u0092t be needed again, unlike, say monster animations and audio, which are likely to reappear later.\n\nI pre-touch the relevant world geometry in the uncached read thread after a texture read has completed, but in hindsight I should have bundled the world geometry directly with the textures and also gotten that with uncached reads.\n\nOpenAL appears to have a limit of 1024 sound buffers, which we bumped into. We could dynamically create and destroy the static buffer mappings without too much trouble, but that is a reasonable number for us to stay under.\n\nAnother behavior of OpenAL that surprised me was finding (by looking at the disassembly) that it touches every 4k of the buffer on a Play() command. This makes some sense, forcing it to page the entire thing into ram so you don\u0092t get broken sound mixing, but it does unpredictably stall the thread issuing the call. I had sort of hoped that they were just eating the page faults in the mixing thread with a decent sized mix ahead buffer, but I presume that they found pathological cases of a dozen sound buffers faulting while the GPU is sucking up all the bus bandwidth or some such. I may yet queue all OpenAL commands to a separate thread, so if it has to page stuff in, the audio will just be slightly delayed instead of hitching the framerate.\n\nI wish I could prioritize the queuing of flash reads \u0096 game thread CPU faults highest, sound samples medium, and textures lowest. I did find that breaking the big texture reads up into chunks helped with the worst case CPU stalls.\n\nThere are two project technical decisions that I fretted over a lot:\n\nBecause I knew that the basic rendering technology could be expressed with fixed function rendering, the game is written to OpenGL ES 1.1, and can run on the older MBX GPU platforms. While it is nice to support older platforms, all evidence is that they are a negligible part of the market, and I did give up some optimization and feature opportunities for the decision.\n\nIt was sort of fun to dust off the old fixed function puzzle skills. For instance, getting monochrome dynamic lighting on top of the DOT3 normal mapping in a single pass involved sticking the lighting factor in the alpha channel of the texture environment color so it feeds through to the blender, where a GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ZERO blend mode effects the modulation on the opaque characters. This sort of fixed function trickery still makes me smile a bit, but it isn\u0092t a relevant skill in the modern world of fragment shaders.\n\nThe other big one is the codebase lineage.\n\nMy personally written set of iPhone code includes the renderer for Wolfenstein RPG, all the iPhone specific code in Wolfenstein Classic and Doom Classic, and a few one-off test applications. At this point, I feel that I have a pretty good idea of what The Right Thing To Do on the platform is, but I don\u0092t have a mature expression of that in a full game. There is some decent code in Doom Classic, but it is all C, and I would prefer to do new game development in (restrained) C++.\n\nWhat we did have was Doom Resurrection, which was developed for us by Escalation Studios, with only a few pointers here and there from me. The play style was a pretty close match (there is much more freedom to look around in RAGE), so it seemed like a sensible thing. This fits with the school of thought that says \u0093never throw away the code\u0094 (http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html ). I take issue with various parts of that, and much of my success over the years has involved wadding things up and throwing it all away, but there is still some wisdom there.\n\nI have a good idea what the codebase would look like if I wrote it from scratch. It would have under 100k of mutable CPU data, there wouldn\u0092t be a resource related character string in sight, and it would run at 60 fps on new platforms / 30 fps on old ones. I\u0092m sure I could do it in four months or so (but I am probably wrong). Unfortunately, I can\u0092t put four months into an iPhone project. I\u0092m pushing it with two months \u0096  I have the final big RAGE crunch and forward looking R&D to get back to.\n\nSo we built on the Resurrection codebase, which traded expediency for various compromise in code efficiency. It was an interesting experience for me, since almost all the code that I normally deal with has my \u0093coding DNA\u0094 on it, because the id Software coding standards were basically \u0093program the way John does.\u0094  The Escalation programmers come from a completely different background, and the codebase is all STL this, boost that, fill-up-the-property list, dispatch the event, and delegate that.\n\nI had been harboring some suspicions that our big codebases might benefit from the application of some more of the various \u0093modern\u0094 C++ design patterns, despite seeing other large game codebases suffer under them. I have since recanted that suspicion.\n\nI whine a lot about it (occasionally on twitter), and I sometimes point out various object lessons to the other mobile programmers, but in the end, it works, and it was probably the right decision."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 824619600, "contents": "*\tpage flip crap\n*\tstretch console\n*\tfaster swimming speed\n*\tdamage direction

The old v1.01 codebase will still be updated to fix bugs with the current version, but I didn't want to hold back from fixing things properly even if it involves some major changes.\n\nI am focusing on the internet play aspect of the game. While I can lay out a grand clean-sheet-of-paper design, I have chosen to pursue something of a limited enough scope that I can expect to start testing it around the end of the month (august). I still have my grand plans for the future, but I want to get some stuff going NOW.\n\nQuakeWorld.\n\nThe code I am developing right now is EXCLUSIVELY for internet play. It will be rolled back into the single player game sometime along the road to Quake 2 (or whatever it turns out to be called), but the experimental QuakeWorld release will consist of seperate programs for the client and the server. They will use the same data as the current registered quake, so the only thing that will be distributed is new executables (they will peacefully coexist with current quake).\n\nThere will be a single master server running here at id. Whenever anyone starts up a server, it will register itself with the master server, and whenever a client wants to start a game, it will inquire with the master to find out which servers are available.\n\nUsers will have a persistant account, and all frags on the entire internet will be logged. I want us to be able to give a global ranking order of everyone playing the game. You should be able to say, \"I am one of the ten best QuakeWorld players in existance\", and have the record to back it up. There are all sorts of other cool stats that we could mine out of the data: greatest frags/minute, longest uninterrupted quake game, cruelest to newbies, etc, etc.\n\nFor the time being, this is just my pet research project. The new exes will only work with registered Quake, so I can justify it as a registration incentive (don't pirate!).\n\nIf it looks feasable, I would like to see internet focused gaming become a justifiable biz direction for us. Its definately cool, but it is uncertain if people can actually make money at it. My halfway thought out proposal for a biz plan is that we let anyone play the game as an anonymous newbie to see if they like it, but to get their name registered and get on the ranking list, they need to pay $10 or so. Newbies would be automatically kicked from servers if a paying customer wants to get on. Sound reasonable?\n\nTechnical improvements.\n\nThe game physics is being reworked to make it faster and more uniform. Currently, a p90 dedicated server is about 50% loaded with eight players. The new network code causes a higher cpu load, so I am trying to at least overbalance that, and maybe make a little headway. A single p6-200 system should be able to run around ten simultanious eight player servers. Multiple servers running on a single machine will work a lot better with the master server automatically dealing with different port adresses behind the client's back.\n\nA couple subtle features are actually going away. The automatic view tilting on slopes and stairs is buggy in v1.01, and over a couple hundred millisecond latancy connection, it doesn't usually start tilting until you are allready on a different surface, so I just ripped it out entirely. A few other non-crucial game behaviors are also being cut in the interest of making the physics easier to match on the client side.\n\nI'm going to do a good chat mode.\n\nServers will have good access control lists. If somebody manages to piss off the entire community, we could even ban them at the master server.\n\nThe big difference is in the net code. While I can remember and justify all of my decisions about networking from DOOM through Quake, the bottom line is that I was working with the wrong basic assumptions for doing a good internet game. My original design was targeted at <200ms connection latencies. People that have a digital connection to the internet through a good provider get a pretty good game experience. Unfortunately, 99% of the world gets on with a slip or ppp connection over a modem, often through a crappy overcrowded ISP. This gives 300+ ms latencies, minimum. Client. User's modem. ISP's modem. Server. ISP's modem. User's modem. Client. God, that sucks.\n\nOk, I made a bad call. I have a T1 to my house, so I just wasn't familliar with PPP life. I'm adressing it now.\n\nThe first move was to scrap the current net code. It was based on a reliable stream as its original primitive (way back in qtest), then was retrofited to have an unreliable sideband to make internet play feasable. It was a big mess, so I took it out and shot it. The new code has the unreliable packet as its basic primitive, and all the complexities that entails is now visible to the main code instead of hidden under the net api. This is A Good Thing. Goodbye phantom unconnected players, messages not getting through, etc.\n\nThe next move was a straightforward attack on latency. The communications channel is not the only thing that contributes to a latent response, and there was some good ground to improve on.\n\nIn a perfect environment, the instant you provided any input (pressed a key, moved a mouse, etc) you would have feedback on the screen (or speaker) from the action.\n\nIn the real world, even single player games have latency.\n\nA typical game loop goes something like: Read user input. Simulate the world. Render a new graphics scene. Repeat.\n\nIf the game is running 15 frames a second, that is 66 ms each frame. The user input will arive at a random point in the frame, so it will be an average of 33 ms before the input is even looked at. The input is then read, and 66 more ms pass before the result is actually displayed to the user, for a total of nearly 100 ms of latency, right on your desktop. (you can even count another 8 ms or so for raster refresh if you want to get picky).\n\nThe best way to adress that latency is to just make the game run faster if possible. If the screen was sized down so that the game ran 25 fps, the latency would be down to 60ms. There are a few other things that can be done to shave a bit more off, like short circuiting some late braeking information (like view angles) directly into the refresh stage, bypassing the simulation stage.\n\nThe bearing that this all has on net play, aside from setting an upper limit on performance, is that the current Quake servers have a similar frame cycle. They had to, to provide -listen server support. Even when you run a dedicated server, the model is still: fetch all input, process the world, send updates out to all clients. The default server framerate is 20 fps (50 ms). You can change this by adjusting the sys_ticrate cvar, but there are problems either way. If you ask for more fps from the server, you may get less latency, but you would almost certainly overcommit the bandwidth of a dialup link, resulting in all sorts of unwanted buffering in the routers and huge multi thousand ms latency times as things unclog (if they ever do).\n\nThe proper way to address this is by changing the server model from a game style loop to a fileserver/database style loop.\n\nInstead of expecting everyone's messages to be dealt with at once, I now deal with each packet as it comes in. That player alone is moved forward in time, and a custom response is sent out in very short order. The rest of the objects in the world are spread out between the incoming packets. There are a lot of issues that that brings up. Time is no longer advancing uniformly for all objects in the world, which can cause a lot of problems.\n\nIt works, though! The average time from a packet ariving at the system to the time a response is sent back is down to under 4ms, as opposed to over 50 with the old dedicated servers.\n\nAnother side benefit is that the server never blindly sends packets out into the void, they must be specifically asked for (note that this is NOT a strict request/reply, because the client is streaming request without waiting for the replies).\n\nI am going to be adding bandwidth estimation to help out modem links. If quake knows that a link is clogged up, it can choose not to send anything else, which is far, far better than letting the network buffer everything up or randomly drop packets. A dialup line can just say \"never send more than 2000 bytes a second in datagrams\", and while the update rate may drop in an overcommited situation, the latency will never pile up like it can with the current version of quake.\n\nThe biggest difference is the addition of client side movement simulation.\n\nI am now allowing the client to guess at the results of the users movement until the authoritative response from the server comes through. This is a biiiig architectural change. The client now needs to know about solidity of objects, friction, gravity, etc. I am sad to see the elegent client-as-terminal setup go away, but I am practical above idealistic.\n\nThe server is still the final word, so the client is allways repredicting it's movement based off of the last known good message from the server.\n\nThere are still a lot of things I need to work out, but the basic results are as hoped for: even playing over a 200+ ms latency link, the player movement feels exactly like you are playing a single player game (under the right circumstances -- you can also get it to act rather weird at the moment).\n\nThe latency isn't gone, though. The client doesn't simulate other objects in the world, so you apear to run a lot closer to doors before they open, and most noticably, projectiles from your weapons seem to come out from where you were, instead of where you are, if you are strafing sideways while you shoot.\n\nAn interesting issue to watch when this gets out is that you won't be able to tell how long the latency to the server is based on your movement, but you will need to lead your opponents differently when shooting at them.\n\nIn a clean sheet of paper redesign, I would try to correct more of the discrepencies, but I think I am going to have a big enough improvement coming out of my current work to make a lot of people very happy."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 839476800, "contents": "Romero is now gone from id.\n\nThere will be no more grandiose statements about our future projects.\n\nI can tell you what I am thinking, and what I am trying to acomplish,  but all I promise is my best effort."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 839649600, "contents": "QuakeWorld structural addendum:\n\nAfter hearing many arguments against the single master server, ranging  from coherent and well reasoned to paranoid whining, I now agree that  the single global master server isn't sufficient.\n\nDuring the R&D phase, there will still be only the single server, but  after all the kinks get worked out, I will allow a small number of  sites to run private master servers.  This will not be a general  release, but only to properly licensed third parties.  That will still  allow me to collect my 100% coverage data, and it will prevent a  single network/computer/software failure from preventing all QuakeWorld play.\n\nQuakeWorld technical addendum:\n\nI am reining in the client side prediction to a fairly minimal amount. It has too many negative effects in different circumstances.  The problem of running away from or in front of your missiles was so bad that I  considered simulating the missiles on the client side, but that is the  second step on a slippery slope.  If just the missiles were simulated,  then a missile would fire through an enemy until the server informed  you it exploded on them.  Then you consider simulating interactions,  but then you have to guess at other player inputs (which is hopeless)...\n\nLesson learned: Simulating 300 ms on the client side in a Quake style  game is just out of the question.  It probably works fine for flight sim  or driving sims, but not in out twitch reaction games.\n\nI am currently using client side simulation to smooth out the beat  frequency interactions between server packet arrival and client frame  times.  In the shipping version of Quake, some latency was introduced  on purpose to keep the displayed frame simulation time between the last  two packets from the server so that the variability in arrival time  could be smoothed out.  In QuakeWorld, I am always starting with the  most current packet, and using simulation to smooth out the variability. This <100ms of client side motion seems to be very manageable, and cuts  out some real latency as well as doing the gueswork.\n\nIt looks like I am going to split the QuakeWorld client into multiple  threads to reduce the avg 1/2 frame latency between input and packet  sending.  This is also a step towards building a multi-threaded Quake  renderer, which will let multi-cpu NT machines render twice as fast. Lets hope the windows thread scheduler is decent...\n\nI have been cutting down the message sizes a bit here and there as  well.  On a modem link, every couple bytes I save translates into a  millisecond of latency saved.  I cut an average of 17 bytes from the  server to client and 8 from the client to server today."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 839822400, "contents": "Apogee's Prey team (and Duke's Levelord) leave 3drealms to work  with Quake technology as Hipnotic Interactive.\n\n:-)"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 839908800, "contents": "I am considering increasing the default sv_friction value for  QuakeWorld from 4 to 6 or 8.\n\nIt might take a little getting used to, but I think it gives more  precise control for wide area network play.\n\nIf anyone wants to run some experiments with different friction  levels on a current Quake server, I would be interested in hearing  some feedback."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 840254400, "contents": "The remote server console commands are fully implemented for  QuakeWorld.\n\nTo allow remote administration, the server must set the \"password\"  cvar.

This will have a good effect on our Quake 2 maps, but probably won't be feasable for homebrew use.\n\nI am finishing up a shadow volume pre-subdivision stage right now, and I need to do the resampling to quake light maps a bit better than I currently am, but I am very pleased with how it has turned out.  A lot of the work will play into the next generation (NOT quake 2) game technology, for things like colored radiosity and dynamic shadows, but it is still cool just for calculating quake light maps.\n\nInstead of placing lots of floating light entities, certain textures are tagged as being light emitters, so if you draw a flourecent light in the ceiling, it will automatically emit light from it's entire area.  Lava emits light from the entire surface.\n\nThe simulation of the light is realistic now, instead of just hacked together.  Light reflects off of surfaces, so ceilings will get lit even if there is no light pointing directly at them.  The way light flows around corners looks eerily realistic.\n\nI fixed the sky volumes so missiles dissapear inside them again, which was necessary to implement a new lighting feature: you can specify the position of the sun (or moon) in degrees,  and the amount of light it will emit.  The light then comes out completely parallel and at a constant intensity, passing through sky volumes to light up all outdoor areas in a consistant way. (this could be retrofited onto light.exe for people unable to run qrad)\n\nNow for the bad news: a full size level takes several minutes to process on our quad alpha, and you MUST do a vis before running qrad (otherwise it would take about 1000 times longer).  This wouldn't be out of reach even on mortal pentium systems (you can ask for a rough aproximation instead of the full job), except for the working set size.  >100 megs.  I'm NOT being wasteful here, either.  I use a halved bit array for visibility interconnects, and sparse scaled shorts for energy transference.\n\nI will release the source after we have been using it in production for a while, in case anyone wants to take a shot at reformulating it to be less memory intensive.  It would be possible to get it down to 32 megs with some reduction in quality and a lot more wasted time, but then the run time would be obnoxious.  I expect homebrew levels are going to have to stick with light.exe.\n\nI am looking forward to doing a little more work on the other utilities as well.  I want to break qbsp up into three seperate programs, so it will be able to run on machines with <32 megs of memory.  Light can be sped up significantly if the PVS information is taken advantage of the way I did in qrad.

It will work on the 3dlabs cards with their next driver release, but it really isn't very optimized yet, so don't expect anything really fast.\n\nIf you have high end hardware (intergraph realizm or dec powerstorm), it is pretty cool.\n\nIt is interesting to look at quake with hires 24 bit trilinear texture mapping. Sometimes you just don't even notice anything is different, but sometimes you can just stare at a scene for quite a while apreciating it.\n\nThrowing bits and pixels at a static design certainly doesn't hurt, but it really doesn't bring it to a new level. I think I know where the next level is, but I'm just at the very beginning of the work on the next game architecture.\n\nWe have three mostly-done things to release: winquake, glquake, and quakeworld.

I am having a hard time tracking it down, and I only get to work on it sporadically. I will spend a bit more time this weekend.\n\nI have given the source for the master server to the QSpy guys and Disruptor to do with as they will (rankings, queries, etc). I know I won't have the time to support it like it deserves.\n\nWinQuake: Michael is almost done.... We only have one reported serious problem, but there are still a list of little issues. We are finally feeling stable on windows. Not everyone may be able to get optimal settings, but SOMETHING should work almost everywhere.\n\nI have an NT alpha machine on order, so we will be compiling for that as well. We aren't going to be able to spend time writing assembly language for it like the intel version has, but it should still run at a pretty decent clip. IBM was talking about getting us a power-PC machine, but I haven't heard back from them in a while. If one shows up, we will compile for that as well.\n\nGLQuake: 3DFX is writing a mini-gl driver that will run glquake. We exepect very high performance. 3Dlabs is also working with me on improving some aspects of their open-GL performance. DynamicPictures sent me an Oxygen board, but glquake did a horrible crash and burn with their beta drivers. They are looking into it. DEC is sending me a powerstorm to work with, which should perform in the same ballpark as the intergraph realizm I did the development work on.\n\nI do expect the 3dfx version to outperform the $5k+ professional gl cards, due to its higher fill rate and the fact that they can tune directly for quake. There are certainly valid reasons to buy $5k cards (24+ bit z buffers, 24 bit color, 1280 res, etc), but don't cry when a $300 card eats their lunch :-).\n\nBecause of the very fill-rate intensive nature of the way I implemented this version of glquake (using a blend pass to do the light maps), performance is not likely to be very good on any current generation consumer level board except 3dfx. The next generation of most vendors cards should have sufficient fill rate, if claims are to be believed. I may do a surface cached version just for the experience, in any case.\n\nOne little public rant: if you are a 3d chip designer, don't even THINK about not supporting true alpha blending. Screen door transparency is not a valid replacement. (this means YOU, matrox!)\n\nIRIX-GLQuake: In two weeks, Ed Hutchins from SGI is coming down and we are going to port glQuake to irix. This will only run (reasonably) on systems with hardware texture mapping: O2, impact, RE2, and IR. No indys, extremes, etc. You could probably use them as dedicated servers, though.\n\nD3DQuake: I started bringing up glquake on direct-3d a couple days ago. We are going to have a very nice, apples-to-apples api comparison here. It takes four times as much code to do anything in D3D as it does in OpenGL, but I will tune both to the best of my abilities and we shall see if there is any performance advantage to either API. We should be able to do comparisons on both 3DFX and 3DLabs hardware with both apis.\n\nQuake utilities: I have split qbsp into two programs: qcsg and qbsp2. The processing is more robust, faster, and more memory frugal, but it currently generates rathar unoptimized maps. I will be writing a seperate map optimizer program soon to get the counts and size back to what they should be. I will probably do a new tool release after we get some more testing time on them. All of the utilities except qbsp now automatically use as many processors as you have if you are running on NT.\n\nNew stuff: The outline of the next generation game engine is beginning to take a bit of shape... I'm applying the lessons learned from quake and I have a long list of new things to try.

This just isn't true, in saveral ways.\n\nThe last time I did side by side system testing involving SGI was pitting an SGI high impact against a intergraph GLZ1T. For heavy texture mapping applications like I was doing, the SGI high impact was three times faster than the intergraph. A realizm-13t is 2.5 times faster than the older GLZ1T, but a max impact is twice as fast as a high impact, so intergraph's best is still only half the speed of sgi's best workstation.\n\nFor the record, here is my impression of the 3D hardware I have worked with, unedited. Prices are for configurations as we would use them, not minimum.\n\nRendition Verite: ($150) It won't set any speed records, but it is an excellent value, the quake port is pretty good, and the risc architecture allows a lot of room for optimization.\n\n3DFX: ($300) The highest textured fill rate of anything short of high end SGI hardware. 50 mpix, almost irrespective of options. You can't run a desktop or high res display on it, but at 640*480 it will stomp any other consumer level board, given equal optimization effort.\n\n3dlabs permedia: ($300) Right now, this is the only well supported low end open GL card. and a good all around video card. The visual quality is hurt over most other 3d boards because the internal paths apear to be 15 bits, so you don't get dithered 24 bit color out of your blending operations. The fill rate is very sensitive to what options (z buffer, blending, color depth, etc) you have turned on. It peaks at over 40 mpix, but that is with no zbuffering and 4 bit textures. Realistic cases (16 bit textures, z buffering, perspective, bilinear) bring you down to around 10 mpix. There are some performance hangups in the drivers for heavy texturing applications, but 3dlabs is working on improving them.\n\nThe remaining boards are pretty much for professional use, not gaming.\n\nDynamic Pictures Oxygen: ($1500) I can't reccomend this to anyone doing texture mapping. It was slow and had rasterization errors.\n\n3dlabs glint-TX: ($1000 - $3000) A reletively low fill rate (15 mpix peak, often a bit lower), but fairly stable in performance. Good GL drivers. Capable of supporting very high resolutions and amounts of texture memory. Available from several vendors at various (professional) price points.\n\nIntergraph intense-3d: ($2000 - $5000). The fill rate still isn't very good (15 mpix), but it hardly cares when you turn on trilinear and blending. They rape you on the texture memory prices. I have gotten better performance (but not tons better) out of this than any glint card I have tested, but I have yet to use one of the dual TX boards. They are also incompatable with a lot of motherboards.\n\nIntergraph realizm: ($7000 - $12000) The best graphics card you can buy for NT. As far as I know, you can't even get these seperately, you have to buy them as part of an intergraph system. The systems we use list around $30k each. The fill rate is 33 mpix, and very insensitive to options. You can add an optional geometry board to get very high transform/light throughput. DEC resells these as their Powerstorm T series cards for alpha systems.\n\nSGI O2: ($10000, full system) The fill rate was better than intergraph's high end, but the triangle throughput was lower. I expect SGI will be able to optimize the porformance more in the coming months. It's not a knock-your-socks-off performer, but a real, fully configured system costs less than just the video option on a high end intergraph.\n\nSGI IMPACT: ($25000 - $50000, full system) excellent fill rate and geometry rate. A very balanced, high performace system. The texture memories are very small (one or four megs), so it would probably be possible to contruct a pathalogical case that probably puts an intergraph ahead of it, but you would have to stretch. The prices are higher than intergraph, but only by about 30%.\n\nSGI Infinite reality: ($100000+) Fill rate from hell. Polygons from hell. If you don't trip up on state changes, nothing will come within shouting distance of this system. You would expect that.\n\nOur decision to go intergraph/NT over SGI/IRIX had a lot more to do with the NT vs IRIX part of it. I wish I could buy SGI hardware for NT. The last two SGI systems I did serious work on were messes of instability, but the O2 we just got last week does actually seem stable.\n\nAs far as the \"which video card should I buy?\" question from gamers, I'm afraid I can't give you a definitive answer. All of the first generation boards have some problem or another. The second generation, coming out within the next six months or so, will be more solidly positive."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 850798800, "contents": "QuakeWorld went up, got to around 4000 users, then the master server exploded.\n\nDisrupter and cohorts are working on more robust code now.\n\nIf anyone did it on purpose, how about letting us know...

I get asked for my opinions about this often enough that it is time I just made a public statement. So here it is, my current position as of december '96...\n\nWhile the rest of Id works on Quake 2, most of my effort is now focused on developing the next generation of game technology. This new generation of technology will be used by Id and other companies all the way through the year 2000, so there are some very important long term decisions to be made.\n\nThere are two viable contenders for low level 3D programming on win32: Direct-3D Immediate Mode, the new, designed for games API, and OpenGL, the workstation graphics API originally developed by SGI. They are both supported by microsoft, but D3D has been evangelized as the one true solution for games.\n\nI have been using OpenGL for about six months now, and I have been very impressed by the design of the API, and especially it's ease of use. A month ago, I ported quake to OpenGL. It was an extremely pleasant experience. It didn't take long, the code was clean and simple, and it gave me a great testbed to rapidly try out new research ideas.\n\nI started porting glquake to Direct-3D IM with the intent of learning the api and doing a fair comparison.\n\nWell, I have learned enough about it. I'm not going to finish the port. I have better things to do with my time.\n\nI am hoping that the vendors shipping second generation cards in the coming year can be convinced to support OpenGL. If this doesn't happen early on and there are capable cards that glquake does not run on, then I apologize, but I am taking a little stand in my little corner of the world with the hope of having some small influence on things that are going to effect us for many years to come.\n\nDirect-3D IM is a horribly broken API. It inflicts great pain and suffering on the programmers using it, without returning any significant advantages. I don't think there is ANY market segment that D3D is apropriate for, OpenGL seems to work just fine for everything from quake to softimage. There is no good technical reason for the existance of D3D.\n\nI'm sure D3D will suck less with each forthcoming version, but this is an oportunity to just bypass dragging the entire development community through the messy evolution of an ill-birthed API.\n\nBest case: Microsoft integrates OpenGL with direct-x (probably calling it Direct-GL or something), ports D3D retained mode on top of GL, and tells everyone to forget they every heard of D3D immediate mode. Programmers have one good api, vendors have one driver to write, and the world is a better place.\n\nTo elaborate a bit:\n\n\"OpenGL\" is either OpenGL 1.1 or OpenGL 1.0 with the common extensions. Raw OpenGL 1.0 has several holes in functionality.\n\n\"D3D\" is Direct-3D Immediate Mode. D3D retained mode is a seperate issue. Retained mode has very valid reasons for existance. It is a good thing to have an api that lets you just load in model files and fly around without sweating the polygon details. Retained mode is going to be used by at least ten times as many programmers as immediate mode. On the other hand, the world class applications that really step to new levels are going to be done in an immediate mode graphics API. D3D-RM doesn't even really have to be tied to D3D-IM. It could be implemented to emit OpenGL code instead.\n\nI don't particularly care about the software only implementations of either D3D or OpenGL. I haven't done serious research here, but I think D3D has a real edge, because it was originally designed for software rendering and much optimization effort has been focused there. COSMO GL is attempting to compete there, but I feel the effort is misguided. Software rasterizers will still exist to support the lowest common denominator, but soon all game development will be targeted at hardware rasterization, so that's where effort should be focused.\n\nThe primary importance of a 3D API to game developers is as an interface to the wide variety of 3D hardware that is emerging. If there was one compatable line of hardware that did what we wanted and covered 90+ percent of the target market, I wouldn't even want a 3D API for production use, I would be writing straight to the metal, just like I allways have with pure software schemes. I would still want a 3D API for research and tool development, but it wouldn't matter if it wasn't a mainstream solution.\n\nBecause I am expecting the 3D accelerator market to be fairly fragmented for the forseeable future, I need an API to write to, with individual drivers for each brand of hardware. OpenGL has been maturing in the workstation market for many years now, allways with a hardware focus. We have exisiting proof that it scales just great from a $300 permedia card all the way to a $250,000 loaded infinite reality system.\n\nAll of the game oriented PC 3D hardware basically came into existance in the last year. Because of the frantic nature of the PC world, we may be getting stuck with a first guess API and driver model which isn't all that good.\n\nThe things that matter with an API are: functionality, performance, driver coverage, and ease of use.\n\nBoth APIs cover the important functionality. There shouldn't be any real argument about that. GL supports some additional esoteric features that I am unlikely to use (or are unlikely to be supported by hardware -- same effect). D3D actually has a couple nice features that I would like to see moved to GL (specular blend at each vertex, color key transparancy, and no clipping hints), which brings up the extensions issue. GL can be extended by the driver, but because D3D imposes a layer between the driver and the API, microsoft is the only one that can extend D3D.\n\nMy conclusion about performance is that there is not going to be any significant performance difference (< 10%) between properly written OpenGL and D3D drivers for several years at least. There are some arguments that gl will scale better to very high end hardware because it doesn't need to build any intermediate structures, but you could use tiny sub cache sized execute buffers in d3d and acheive reasonably similar results (or build complex hardware just to suit D3D -- ack!). There are also arguments from the other side that the vertex pools in d3d will save work on geometry bound applications, but you can do the same thing with vertex arrays in GL.\n\nCurrently, there are more drivers avaialble for D3D than OpenGL on the consumer level boards. I hope we can change this. A serious problem is that there are no D3D conformance tests, and the documentation is very poor, so the existing drivers aren't exactly uniform in their functionality. OpenGL has an established set of conformance tests, so there is no argument about exactly how things are supposed to work. OpenGL offers two levels of drivers that can be written: mini client drivers and installable client drivers. A MCD is a simple, robust exporting of hardware rasterization capabilities. An ICD is basically a full replacement for the API that lets hardware accelerate or extend any piece of GL without any overhead.\n\nThe overriding reason why GL is so much better than D3D has to do with ease of use. GL is easy to use and fun to experiment with. D3D is not (ahem). You can make sample GL programs with a single page of code. I think D3D has managed to make the worst possible interface choice at every oportunity. COM. Expandable structs passed to functions. Execute buffers. Some of these choices were made so that the API would be able to gracefully expand in the future, but who cares about having an API that can grow if you have forced it to be painful to use now and forever after? Many things that are a single line of GL code require half a page of D3D code to allocate a structure, set a size, fill something in, call a COM routine, then extract the result.\n\nEase of use is damn important. If you can program something in half the time, you can ship earlier or explore more aproaches. A clean, readable coding interface also makes it easier to find / prevent bugs.\n\nGL's interface is procedural: You perform operations by calling gl functions to pass vertex data and specify primitives.\n\n[code]\nglBegin (GL_TRIANGLES);\nglVertex (0,0,0);\nglVertex (1,1,0);\nglVertex (2,0,0);\nglEnd ();\n[/code]\n\nD3D's interface is by execute buffers: You build a structure containing vertex data and commands, and pass the entire thing with a single call. On the surface, this apears to be an efficiency improvement for D3D, because it gets rid of a lot of procedure call overhead. In reality, it is a gigantic pain-in-the-ass.\n\n[code]\n(psuedo code, and incomplete)\nv = &buffer.vertexes[0];\nv->x = 0; v->y = 0; v->z = 0;\nv++;\nv->x = 1; v->y = 1; v->z = 0;\nv++;\nv->x = 2; v->y = 0; v->z = 0;\nc = &buffer.commands;\nc->operation = DRAW_TRIANGLE;\nc->vertexes[0] = 0;\nc->vertexes[1] = 1;\nc->vertexes[2] = 2;\nIssueExecuteBuffer (buffer);\n[/code]\n\nIf I included the complete code to actually lock, build, and issue an execute buffer here, you would think I was choosing some pathologically slanted case to make D3D look bad.\n\nYou wouldn't actually make an execute buffer with a single triangle in it, or your performance would be dreadfull. The idea is to build up a large batch of commands so that you pass lots of work to D3D with a single procedure call.\n\nA problem with that is that the optimal definition of \"large\" and \"lots\" varies depending on what hardware you are using, but instead of leaving that up to the driver, the application programmer has to know what is best for every hardware situation.\n\nYou can cover some of the messy work with macros, but that brings its own set of problems. The only way I can see to make D3D generally usable is to create your own procedural interface that buffers commands up into one or more execute buffers and flushes when needed. But why bother, when there is this other nifty procedural API allready there...\n\nWith OpenGL, you can get something working with simple, straightforward code, then if it is warranted, you can convert to display lists or vertex arrays for max performance (although the difference usually isn't that large). This is the right way of doing things -- like converting your crucial functions to assembly language after doing all your development in C.\n\nWith D3D, you have to do everything the painful way from the beginning. Like writing a complete program in assembly language, taking many times longer, missing chances for algorithmic improvements, etc. And then finding out it doesn't even go faster.\n\nI am going to be programming with a 3D API every day for many years to come. I want something that helps me, rather than gets in my way.\n\nJohn Carmack\nId Software"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 853045200, "contents": "We now have someone officially in charge of quake/quakeworld unix ports:\n\nDave 'Zoid' Kirsch.

During a network game (or internet phone or videoconference), all the packets are just between two addresses, but tons of bandwidth (and corresponding latency) is eaten by sending full headers. Has anyone developed UDP header compression extensions, and if so, how common are they?\n\nOn a lower hardware level, have any modem manufacturers considered optimizing interfaces or protocols for lower packet latency? Once again, if I understand correctly, modem transmission involves a level of packetizing for modulation/protocol/compression work that is underneath the serial interface seen by a computer. Do partially filled buffers sit idle for a time if there isn't a continuous stream of data, or do they immediately flush when a byte failes to clock in? It would be nice to be able to explicitly syncronize with UDP packets, because a realtime game running within bandwidth limits is going to send and receive discrete packets interspersed with idle time, which is not really what modems are optimized for now. I know that modem data compression is generally a bad thing for low latency connections right now, but if the modem could be signaled to flush at UDP boundaries, it would probably become a positive thing. I'm sure there are also things that could be done at the modulation/protocol layer to improve latency at some cost in bandwidth or error rate, but I have no idea if it could be done compatably.\n\nIt would be an interesting point of differentiation for ISP's or modem manufacturers if an \"optimize for games\" checkbox was available somewhere.

This wasn't an option when we had to support dos, but I think it is the correct choice now.\n\nThere are a lot of issues involved with this.\n\nAs everyone who has tried to do anything serious with qc knows, it has its limitations (ahem). I could improve the language, or just adopt a real language like java, but the simplest thing to do would be just use native code.\n\nIt would definately be more efficient as a dll. As we do more sophisticated game logic, efficiency becomes more and more important. For simple deathmatch modifications this wouldn't be a big deal, but for full size game levels it will likely be at least a 5% to 10% overall speed improvement.\n\nIt would be non-portable. I am dreading the reaction to this from the linux community. Game modifications would have to be compiled seperately for each target architecture (windows, linux, irix, etc). I do still intend to have the client be generic to all mods (but more flexible than Q1), so it is really only an issue for servers.\n\nThere are security concerns. I suppose to a world that embraces Active-X, this isn't really an issue, but binary code patches still spook me.\n\nYou would actually need a compiler to hack quake. For the serious people, this isn't an issue, but it would cut out a number of people that currently enjoy hacking quake. I have a strange mixture of pride and shame when I think about the people that have actually started learning programming in my crappy little qc language.\n\nYou could debug your patch in a real debugger! Yipee!"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 858657600, "contents": "I have gotten a significant amount of response on the Quake 2 extension mechanism. I do read everything that comes my way (I can't respond to all of it, though), and I have learned a few things from the mail.\n\nNothing is set in stone yet, but it is still looking like a dll is going to be the primary interface. I have been seriously considering a java interface, but the tradeoffs (time spent implementing takes away from something else..) just don't quite add up. Other options, like enhancing qc or using other languages like perl have very remote chances.\n\nOne of the primary reasons is that you can allways build UP - put more functionality on top of a dll, but you can't allways build DOWN - accessing the registry from java for instance.\n\nFor Id Software to develop a game, a dll will be most efficient. We have more cpu power, and we can debug it more easily. We are directing significant effort towards making Quake 2 a better GAME, as well as just a better mutliplayer virtual world. Quake 1 was pretty messed up from a game standpoint, and we don't plan on doing that again.\n\nWhat I can offer the qc hacking crowd is a public release of the qc interface and interpreter code from Quake 1 when Quake 2 is released. The user community can then bolt things together so that there can be one publicly trusted DLL that executes an updated and modified qc language for portable, secure add ons.\n\nI really do care about portability, but it is just one factor that needs to be balanced against all the others. Things just aren't clear cut.\n\nSpeaking of portability, to remove the guesswork that goes on, here are my current opinions on the various platforms:\n\nWin32 \nWin32 rules the world. You are sticking your head in the sand if you think otherwise. The upside is that windows really doesn't suck nowdays. Win 95 / NT 4.0 are pretty decent systems for what they are targeted at. I currently develop mostly on NT, and Quake 2 will almost certainly be delivered on win32 first. Our games should run as well as possible in NT, we won't require any '95 only features.\n\nDos \nWe are not going to do another dos game. No amount of flaming hate mail is going to change my mind on this (PLEASE don't!). The advantages of good TCP/IP support, dynamic linking, powerfull virtual memory, device drivers, etc, are just too much to overcome. Yes, all of those can be provided under dos in various ways, but it just isn't worth it.\n\nLinux \nI consider linux the second most important platform after win32 for id. From a biz standpoint it would be ludicrous to place it even on par with mac or os/2, but for our types of games that are designed to be hacked, linux has a big plus: the highest hacker to user ratio of any os. I don't personally develop on linux, because I do my unixy things with NEXTSTEP, but I have a lot of technical respect for it.\n\nMacOS \nFrom a money making standpoint, the only OS other than win32 that matters, and it doesn't matter all that much. We have professional ports done to MacOS instead of unsupported hack ports, which is a mixed blessing. They come out a lot later (still waiting for quake..), but are more full featured. I have zero respect for the MacOS on a technical basis. They just stood still and let microsoft run right over them from waaay behind. I wouldn't develop on it.\n\nOS/2 \nA native OS/2 port of any of our products is unlikely. We just don't care enough, and we are unwilling to take time away from anything else.\n\nSGI \nI don't particularly care for IRIX as a development environment (compared to NT or NEXTSTEP), but SGI has the coolest hardware to run GL apps on. Safe to assume future IRIX ports, but its not exactly a top priority.\n\nAIX / OSF / HPUX / SOLARIS \nI wouldn't start a port to any of these, but if a trusted party (Zoid) wanted to do them, I probably wouldn't object.\n\nBeOS \nI bought a BeBox because I am a solid believer in SMP, and I like clean, from-scratch systems. I was left fairly non plussed by it. Yes, it is lean and mean and does a couple things better than any other OS I have seen, but I just don't see any dramatic advantages to it over, say, NEXTSTEP. Lion (the company doing the mac quake port) has a BeOS port of quake sort of working, and have my full support in releasing it, but it will be strictly an act of charity on their part, so don't expect too much.\n\nPlan9 \nI spent a few months running Plan9. It has an achingly elegent internal structure, but a user interface that has been asleep for the past decade. I had an older version of quake dedicated server running on it (don't ask me for it - I lost it somewhere) and I was writing a civilized window manager for it in my spare time, but my spare time turned out to be only a couple hours a month, and it just got prioritized out of existance.\n\nNEXTSTEP \nMy faviorite environment. NT and linux both have advantages in some areas, but if they were on equal footing I would choose NEXTSTEP hands down. It has all the power of unix (there are lots of things I miss in NT), the best UI (IMHO, of cource), and it just makes sense on so many more levels than windows. Yes, you can make windows do anything you want to if you have enough time to beat on it, but you can come out of it feeling like you just walked through a sewer.\n\nIn the real world, things aren't on equal footing, and I do most of my work on NT now. I hold out hope that it may not stay that way. If apple Does The Right Thing with rhapsody, I will be behind them as much as I can. NEXTSTEP needs a couple things to support games properly (video mode changing and low level sound access). If apple/next will provide them, I will personally port our current win32 products over.\n\nIf I can convince apple to do a good hardware accelerated OpenGL in rhapsody, I would be very likely to give my win NT machine the cold shoulder and do future development on rhapsody.

I bet they weren't expecting many game companies. :)\n\nSome comparative timings (in seconds):\n\n[code]\nmips = 180 mhz R10000, 1meg secondary cache\nintel = 200 mhz ppro, 512k secondary cache\nalpha = 433 mhz 21164a, 2meg secondary cache\n\nqvis3 on cashspace:\n\ncpus    mips    intel   alpha\n----    ----    ----    ----\n   1     608     905     470\n   2     309     459\n   3     208     308\n   4     158     233\n   8      81\n  12      57\n  16      43\n[/code]\n\n(14 to 1 scalability on 16 cpus, and that's including the IO!)\n\nThe timings vary somewhat on other tools - qrad3 stresses the main memory a lot harder, and the intel system doesn't scale as well, but I have found these times to be fairly representative. Alpha is almost twice as fast as intel, and mips is in between.\n\nNone of these processors are absolutely top of the line - you can get 195 mhz r10k with 4meg L2, 300 mhz PII, and 600 mhz 21164a. Because my codes are highly scalable, we were better off buing more processors at a lower price, rather than the absolute fastest available.\n\nSome comments on the cost of speed:\n\nA 4 cpu pentium pro with plenty of memory can be had for around $20k from bargain integrators. Most of our Quake licensees have one of these.\n\nFor about $60k you can get a 4 cpu, 466 mhz alphaserver 4100. Ion Storm has one of these, and it is twice as fast as a quad intel, and a bit faster than six of our mips processors.\n\nThat level of performance is where you run into a wall in terms of cost.\n\nTo go beyond that with intel processors, you need to go to one of the \"enterprise\" systems from sequent, data general, ncr, tandem, etc. There are several 8 and 16 processor systems available, and the NUMA systems from sequent and DG theoretically scale to very large numbers of CPUS (32+). The prices are totally fucked. Up to $40k PER CPU! Absolutely stupid.\n\nThe only larger alpha systems are the 8200/8400 series from dec, which go up to 12 processors at around $30k per cpu. We almost bought an 8400 over a year ago when there was talk of being able to run NT on it.\n\nOther options are the high end sun servers (but sparc's aren't much faster than intel) and the convex/hp systems (which wasn't shipping when we purchased).\n\nWe settled on the SGI origin systems because it ran my codes well, is scalable to very large numbers of processors (128), and the cost was only about $20k per cpu. We can also add Infinite Reality graphics systems if we want to.\n\nWithin a couple years, I'm sure that someone will make a plug-in SCI board for intel systems, and you will be able to cobble together NUMA systems for under $10k a cpu, but right now the SGI is the most suitable thing for us.\n\nI have been asked a few times if Quake will ever use multiple processors. You can allways run a dedicated server on one cpu and connect to it to gain some benefit, but that's not very convenient, doesn't help much, and is useless for internet play.\n\nIt's waaaay down on the priority list, but I have a cool scheme that would let me make multiple copies of the software rendering dll and frame pipeline the renderers. Response is cut by half and the frame rate would double for two cpus, but pipelining more than a frame would be a bad idea (you would get lag on your own system).\n\nI wouldn't count on it, but some day I might take a break from serious work and hack it in.\n\nThere is no convenient way to use multiple processors with the hardware accelerated versions, except to run the server on a seperate cpu.\n\nThat will probably be an issue that needs to be addressed in the lifespan of the next generation technology. Eventually people are going to start sticking multiple cpus (or multiple thread issue systems sharing resources) on a single chip, and it will become a consumer level item.

Just for the record, they have NOT contacted us about any meetings.\n\nAll the various dramas in this skit haven't quite settled down, but it looks like microsoft is going to consciously do The Wrong Thing, because of politcal issues. Sigh.\n\nOur goal was to get the NT OpenGL MCD driver model released for win-95, so IHVs could easily make robust, high performance, fully compliant OpenGL implementations. Microsoft has squashed that. Flushed their own (good) work down the toilet.\n\nThe two remaining options are to have vendors create full ICD opengl implementations, or game specific mini-drivers.\n\nFull ICD drivers are provided by intergraph, 3dlabs, real3d, and others, and can run on both NT and 95 (with code changes). Microsoft still supports this, and any vendor can create one, but it is a lot of work to get the provided ICD code up to par, and bug prone. On the plus side, non-game tools like level editors can take full advantage of them.\n\nMinidrivers certainly work fine - we have functional ones for 3dfx and powerVR, and they have the possibility of providing slightly better performance than fully compliant drivers, but partial implementations are going to cause problems in the future.\n\nWe will see some of both types of drivers over the next year, and Quake 2 should work fine with either.

The statement asks Microsoft to develop a stonger link between D3D and OGL.The press release, was signed by several game developers representing the top tier 3-D game developers. Microsoft is dedicated to maintaining an active relationship with its DirectX developers. In response to this request Microsoft will host the developers included in the statement at a developers roundtable in July. The purpose of the roundtable is to openly consolidate input and feedback from developers. Tentative date for the roundtable is immediately following Meltdown, July 18.\n\nDirect3D is Microsoft's recommended API for game developers with more than 100 developers using Direct3D as the defacto consumer API. OGL is widely regarded as a professional API designed for high precision applications such as CAD, CAM, etc. Our hope is that this round table will provide Microsoft with the feedback required to evolve our 3D APIs in a way that delivers the best platform for our developers.\n\nIf you have any questions or wish to speak with a Microsoft spokesperson, please let me know.\n\nJulie Whitehead"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 868248000, "contents": "The quality of Quake's software has been a topic of some discussion lately. I avoid IRC like the plague, but I usually hear about the big issues.\n\nQuake has bugs. I freely acknowledge it, and I regret them. However, Quake 1 is no longer being actively developed, and any remaining bugs are unlikely to be fixed. We would still like to be aware of all the problems, so we can try to avoid them in Quake 2.\n\nAt last year's #quakecon, there was talk about setting up a bug list maintained by a member of the user community. That would have been great. Maybe it will happen for Quake 2.\n\nThe idea of some cover up or active deception regarding software quality is insulting.\n\nTo state my life .plan in a single sentance: \"I want to write the best software I can\". There isn't even a close second place. My judgement and my work are up for open criticism (I welcome insightfull commentary), but I do get offended when ulterior motives are implied.\n\nSome cynical people think that every activity must revolve around the mighty dollar, and anyone saying otherwise is just attempting to delude the public. I will probably never be able to convince them that isn't allways the case, but I do have the satisfaction of knowing that I live in a less dingy world than they do.\n\nI want bug free software. I also want software that runs at infinite speed, takes no bandwidth, is flexible enough to do anything, and was finished yesterday.\n\nEvery day I make decisions to let something stand and move on, rather than continuing until it is \"perfect\". Often, I really WANT to keep working on it, but other things have risen to the top of the priority que, and demand my attention.\n\n\"Good software\" is a complex metric of many, many dimensions. There are sweet spots of functionality, quality, efficiancy and timeliness that I aim for, but fundamentally YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING.\n\nA common thought is that if we just hired more programmers, we could make the product \"better\".\n\nIt's possible we aren't at our exactly optimal team size, but I'm pretty confidant we are close.\n\nFor any given project, there is some team size beyond which adding more people will actually cause things to take LONGER. This is due to loss of efficiency from chopping up problems, communication overhead, and just plain entropy. It's even easier to reduce quality by adding people.\n\nI contend that the max programming team size for Id is very small.\n\nFor instance, sometimes I need to make a change in the editor, the utilities, and the game all at once to get a new feature in. If we had the task split up among three seperate programmers, it would take FAR longer to go through a few new revs to debug a feature. As it is, I just go do it all myself. I originated all the code in every aspect of the project, so I have a global scope of knowledge that just wouldn't be possible with an army of programmers dicing up the problems. One global insight is worth a half dozen local ones.\n\nCash and Brian assist me quite a lot, but there is a definite, very small, limit to how many assistants are worthwhile. I think we are pretty close to optimal with the current team.\n\nIn the end, things will be done when the are done, and they should be pretty good. :)\n\nA related topic from recent experience:\n\nAnatomy of a mis-feature:\n----\n As anyone who has ever disected it knows, Quake's triangle model format is a mess. Any time during Quake's development that I had to go back and work with it, I allways walked over to Michael and said \"Ohmygod I hate our model format!'. I didn't have time to change it, though. After quake's release, I WANTED to change it, especially when I was doing glquake, but we were then the proud owners of a legacy data situation.\n\nThe principle reason for the mess is a feature.\n\nAutomatic animation is a feature that I trace all the way back to our side-scroller days, when we wanted simple ways to get tile graphics to automatically cycle through animations without having to programatically each object through its frames.\n\nI thought, \"Hmm. That should be a great feature for Quake, because it will allow more motion without any network bandwidth.\"\n\nSo, we added groups of frames and groups of skins, and a couple ways to control the timing and syncronization. It all works as designed, but parsing the file format and determining the current frames was gross.\n\nIn the end, we only used auto-frame-animation for torches, and we didn't use auto-skin-animation at all (Rogue did in mission pak 2, though).\n\nAh well, someone might use the feature for something, and its allready finished, so no harm done, right?\n\nWrong. There are a half dozen or so good features that are apropriate to add to the triangle models in a quake technology framework, but the couple times that I started doing the research for some of them, I allways balked at having to work with the existing model format.\n\nThe addition of a feature early on caused other (more important) features to not be developed.\n\nWell, we have a new model format for Quake 2 now. Its a ton simpler, manages more bits of precision, includes the gl data, and is easy to extend for a couple new features I am considering. It doesn't have auto-animation.\n\nThis seems like an easy case - almost anyone would ditch auto-animation for, say, mesh level of detail, or multi-part models. The important point is that the cost of adding a feature isn't just the time it takes to code it. The cost also includes the addition of an obsticle to future expansion.\n\nSure, any given feature list can be implemented, given enough coding time. But in addition to coming out late, you will usually wind up with a codebase that is so fragile that new ideas that should be dead-simple wind up taking longer and longer to work into the tangled existing web.\n\nThe trick is to pick the features that don't fight each other. The problem is that the feature that you pass on will allways be SOMEONE's pet feature, and they will think you are cruel and uncaring, and say nasty things about you.\n\nSigh.\n\nSometimes the decisions are REALLY hard, like making head to head modem play suffer to enable persistant internet servers."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 868593600, "contents": "Zoid commented that my last .plan update sounded like Fred Brooks \"The Mythical Man-Month\".

Id software was really conceived when me, Tom, and Romero made a Super Mario 3 clone after I figured out how to do smooth scrolling EGA games. We actually sent it to nintendo to see if they wanted to publish a PC game, but the interest wasn't there. We wound up doing the Commander Keen games for Apogee instead, and the rest is history.\n\nI was looking forward to meeting Mr. Miyamoto, but he wound up canceling at the last minute. :(\n\nOh well. I hope everyone that went enjoyed my talk. All the other speakers had powerpoint presentations and detailed discussion plans, but I just rambled for an hour..\n\nI notced that there was a report about my discussion of model level of detail that was in error. I have an experimental harness, an algorithm, and a data structure for doing progressive mesh style LOD rendereing in the quake engine, but I suspect it won't make it into the production Quake 2. Other things are higher priority for us. I may assist some of the quake licensees if they want to pursue it later.\n\n-\n\nA couple data / feature changes going into the latest (and I hope final) revision of the Quake bsp file format:\n\nBack in my update a month ago where I discussed losing automatic frame animation in models to clean up the format and logic, I mentioned that I still supported automatic texture animation.\n\nNot anymore. There were several obnoxious internal details to dealing with it, especially now with textures outside the bsp file, so I changed the aproach.\n\nWhen a texture is grabbed, you can now specify another texture name as the next animation in a chain. Much better than the implicit-by-name specification from Quake1.\n\nNo animation is automatic now. A bmodel's frame number determines how far along the animation chain to go to find the frame. Textures without animation chains just stay in the original frame.\n\nThere is a slight cost in network traffic required to update frame numbers on otherwise unmoving objects, but due to the QuakeWorld style delta compression it is still less than a Quake 1 scene with no motion at all.\n\nThe benefit, aside from internal code cleanliness, is that a game can precisely control any sequence of animation on a surface. You could have cycles that go forward and backwards through a sequence, you could make slide projectors that only change on specific inputs, etc.\n\nYou could not independantly animate two sides of a bmodel that were not syncronized with the same number of frames, but you could allways split it into multiple models if your really needed to.\n\nEverything is simple when its done, but I actually agonized over animation specification for HOURS yesterday..\n\nThe last significant thing that I am working on in the map format is leaf clustering for vis operations. You can specify some map brushes as \"detail\" brushes, and others as \"structural\" brushes. The BSP and portal list is built for just the structural brushes, then the detail brushes are filtered in later.\n\nThis saves a bit of space, but is primarily for allowing complex levels to vis in a reasonable amount of time. The vis operation is very sensitive to complexity in open areas, and usually has an exponentially bad falloff time. Most of the complexity is in the form of small brushes that never really occlude anything. A box room with ten torch holders on the walls would consist of several dozen mostly open leafs. If the torch holders were made detail brushes, the room would just be a single leaf.\n\nA detail / structural seperation is also, I believe, key to making a portal renderer workable. I had a version of Quake that used portals at the convex volume level, and the performance characteristics had considerably worse-than-linear falloff with complexity. By reducing the leaf count considerably, it probably becomes very workable. I will certainly be reevaluating it for trinity.\n\n\n* trans33, trans66, flow flags in gl\n* damped warp modulation in gl\n* ref_soft running with new data\n\n+ shots are exploding on the sky again\n+ auto set window contents if translucent\n+ don't set qe4 texture unless notexture\n+ try new console background\n+ finish animation cycling\n\ndetail brushes could be extended to be destroyable\nnew texture specification by three points?\ncheck -tmpin -tmpout in bsp utils\nrename texinfo to surfinfo?\npitch change during jumping\nminimized window notification when a new client joins?\nshould origin brushes be included in bsp file for completeness?\nuse nodraw flag\npitch change when ducking\nqrad light bleeds"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 871272000, "contents": "* don't set qe4 texture unless notexture\n* don't set qe4 texture on cancel unless changed\n* grabbed new menu and console\n* invert mouse off in default.cfg\n* all software flags\n* mist contents\n\n+ imagelist command in software\n\ntrinity: save out projection outlines from editor for textures\nadd a 5th control axis (and 6th?) for spaceorb ducking\ngl: don't keep lightmap blocks around in main memory?\nentities not visible (or only visible) to owners\nlook in direction other than motion for hmd\nquake as root directory problem\ndir command\nsoftware surface / edge allocation issues"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 871358400, "contents": "* qe4 project on command line\n* qe4 rshcmd replacement\n* qe4 select face\n* qe4 avoid multiple autosaves\n* qe4 region selected brushes\n* bindlist command\n* imagelist command in ref_soft\n\n+ leaktest\n+ load game.dll from gamedir\n\npendulum motion\nno jump on lava floor?\n-game\n16 bit wall textures"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 871444800, "contents": "* cls.fixedimage support\n* no frame before cinematic fix\n* menu during cinematic fix\n\n+ ingame cinematic state\n+ indemo cinematic state\n- move fraglogfile into game dll\n+ layout language beyond simple centerprint\n+ killserver needs to kill demos as well\n+ must kill cinematic after menu, or restart palette\n+ disconnected can be either at a console or running the demo + intro cinematic\nneeds to be part of the game\n\nforce nolerp lag?\nput ip filtering in game dll\nhandle localmodels explicitly, rather than as *num\ndon't send heartbeats if not running a network game?\nmove viewmodel for all accelerations, including jumping and landing\nfade out centerprints\ndesign quit screen to allow addons to get credits\nbe consistant with window title bars\nmp3 audio\nqe4: downsample option, nomipmap option"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 871531200, "contents": "* qe4 project dialog fix\n* intermission spots and movement\n* hud transfer framework\n\n+ micro levels that just play cinematics?\n+ BUTTON_ANY option\n\nremove oldorigin\nuse static arrays for map elements in renderers?\nunit level statistics"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 871617600, "contents": "* smart background clear\n* worked around 100% viewsize floating point bug\n* increased base surface cache size\n* unified server commands and prog commands\n* fixed same level reload bug in ref_soft\n\n+ are lightmaps allways being saved, even if all black?\n+ is notify box used for anything?\n+ toggleconsole when connected to a net game\n+ server needs to be able to send staticpics\n+ draw to front buffer without swapping option\n- can game.dll register commands?\n+ direct sound and keyboard restart so ref can destroy window\n+ loading plaque on local system doesn't wait for hud erase\n\nframe flicker option for evaluating missed VBL?\nway to add remote commands on client side by scripts?\ncheck client entering during intermission\nmoveable transparant bmodels\nuse sneaking in shadows to let players get a good look at more monsters\ntranslate cinematic to greyscale instead of blanking?\nremove zombietime?\nare userinfo updates getting sent?"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 871704000, "contents": "download static screen images?\n+ how to change semi-protected variables without killing server?\n+ how do demo servers progress to the next server?\n+ how does the client distinguish between a demo server?

We will probably build something off of the quake sound code for the release.\n\nI think I am going to be able to get away with just making all the code public domain. No license, no copyleft, nothing.

Unfortunately, opinions tend to be spread over the entire group, and I am not confortable with how this makes me perceived.\n\nBuilding up animosity between developers is not a very worthwhile thing.\n\nA little chest-beating doesn't really hurt anything, but putting down other developers has negative consequences.\n\nI think that we have a track record that we can be proud of here at id, but we are far from perfect, and I would prefer to cast no stones.\n\nThe user community often exerts a lot of pressure towards confrontation, though. People like to pick a \"side\", and there are plenty of people interested in fighting over it. There are a lot of people that dislike id software for no reason other than they have chosen another \"side\". I don't want to encourage that.\n\nMagazine articles are usually the trigger for someone getting upset here. Its annoying to have something you are directly involved in misrepresented in some way for all the world to see. However, I have been misquoted enough by the press to make me assume that many inflamatory comments are taken out of context or otherwise massaged. It makes a good story, after all.\n\nSure, there ARE developers that really do think they are going to wipe us off the face of the earth with their next product, and don't mind telling everyone all about it. Its always possible. They can give it their best shot, and we'll give it ours.

this week.\n\nIt has always been a problem with Quake that putting a door in front of a complex area didn't make the scene run any faster, unlike DOOM. In glquake, it actually made it significantly slower as you aproached the door, due to overdraw.\n\nThere was also the related problem that monsters heard sounds through doors even if they were closed.\n\nThis was because the primary culling mechanism used by Quake is the PVS - the Potentially Visible Set. It only knew about anything that you could POTENTIALLY see from your current (rough) position. If a door might open, the PVS would allways contain everything that you could see even if the door was currently closed.\n\nQuake 2 now has a way to allow you to lop off large amounts of the map irrespective of the PVS.\n\nA map is now divided into \"areas\" by \"areaportal\" entities, usually in door frames.\n\nIf the area behind a door is not reachable by any open areaportals, then nothing from that area will be visible or hearable. This helps both rendering speed and network bandwidth. It also give the level designer an easy \"band-aid\" when they have designed an area that is too slow.\n\nNote that the area-reachable test is strictly a topological flood fill, so if there is ANY route to the other side of a door open, you will still be processing the area behind the door, even if there is no real way you could see through the available route.\n\nIf your level has a reasonable number of doors, it will often run at a fair speed without any PVS information at all.\n\nTo use this feature, you create a thin \"func_areaportal\" entity that hides completely inside the door, then target the door at it. Qbsp3 does a bunch of work behind your back that you really don't want to know about. Doors have special logic in the game to open or close the areaportal at the apropriate time.\n\nI chose not to make it an automatic feature of doors for a few reasons:\n\n1) Teamed double or quad doors would not create a single portal across the entire doorway.\n\n2) The areaportal entity can also be used for things like exploding walls. You can even put one just around a corner and trigger it with a field, but it is usually better to just let the PVS take care of corner bends.\n\n3) Complex doors would have created complex (but invisible) area portal brushes, which would have messed up the bsp a bit.\n\nI think this was the very last data file change for quake II, so here is the current external files header for the curious:

There are plenty of things that are getting better every single day, but we need to chop it off at some point to let everyone test it out.\n\nWe will do another demo after we finish the full retail product, so if you don't like looking at preproduction stuff, wait for that one.\n\nStill, I am pretty happy with the test. I think Quake 2 is definately the most cohesive game we have ever done.\n\nDon't worry - just because the test doesn't have multiplayer in it, it doesn't mean that we haven't been thinking about it. Many features in the quake 2 architecture are going to enable a whole new level of net play. It will take a few months after the full release for all the potential to start showing through, but just you wait!\n\nThe biggest changes to Quake 2 are internal. Anyone doing modification work on Quake is going to be ecstatic when they get to work with quake2. The game dll source code and all the utilities (including the OpenGl map editor) will be released shortly after the game hits store shelves."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 877320000, "contents": "Many of the comments about the Quake 2 test are already being addressed. We expected quite a few of them, but the test has served its purpose of bringing in some good feedback that we couldn't have predicted.\n\nThe final game will definately be better as a result of the test.\n\nHowever, it certainly won't please everyone. I am confident that the majority will think that Quake 2 is significantly better than anything we have ever done before, but even if we please 80% of our potential customers, that will still leave a couple hundred thousand people thinking that we let them down.\n\nI suppose that I have it the easiest there - I can always defend my technical decisions with specific discussions of my evaluations of the tradeofs that led me to the paths I chose. In fact, in a large number of cases when someone suggests something, I can actually say \"Tried it. Didn't work as well.\"\n\nDefending level design, artwork, or sounds is a lot harder. We can't even always agree here at id on many of these issues, so we know for sure that we can't please all the users simultaniously. All we can do is put talented people on the job and have confidence in their abilities.\n\nNote: Q2TEST DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY HIGH QUALITY SOUNDS! That would have added another 15 megs to the demo size. Selecting high quality sounds just upsamples the existing 11khz / 8 bit sounds. There is a significant quality increase (at a slight speed and memory cost) with the full production sounds.\n\nQuake 2's goal is to be the best first person shooter ever. We are trying to evolve a genre, not move to a different one. If you don't want a game that mostly consists of running around and killing things, you will be dissapointed. We are trying to be cohesive, but not deep. I have high hopes for the games that are atempting to aply our technology to other genres, but don't look for it in Quake 2.\n\nA quick plug:\n\nif you have any interest in programming, you should look at Michael Abrash's Graphics Programming Black Book Special Edition.

We intend to fix any bugs that turn up, improve the speed somewhat, and optimize for internet play in various ways. We will also be making several deathmatch only maps.\n\nDeathmatch in Q2 has gotten a lot of lan testing (Thresh, Redwood, and Vik Long helped quite a bit the last week with tuning), but not much internet testing. There are probably gaping holes in it, but we will address them soon.\n\nThe deathmatch code in the shipping Q2 is also not designed to hold up against malicious users - there is no protection against clients being obnoxious and constantly changing skins, chat flooding, client-side cheating, or whatever.\n\nQ2 does checksum maps on the client side right now, so cheater maps won't work like they do in Q1, but cheater models and skins are still possible. I have some plans to combat that in the point release, but there are a lot of forms of cheating that can be implemented in proxies that are fundamentally not detectable. I can make it very painfully difficult for people to implement such things, but a very clever person with a dissasembler just can't be stopped completely.\n\nThe server code and network protocol should be able to support ultra-large player counts, but I know I need to do some low-level work to get around operating system buffer limits before it will actually work. We will test at least a hundred players in a giant map for the point release, but we won't actually address the issues of making a rational game at that level (chat hierarchies, team spawning, etc). I am very much looking forward to seeing what the user community creates on that foundation.\n\nIt is likely that the point release may have incompatable network protocols and savegames. Fair warning.\n\nQ2 Demo.\n\nAfter the point release, we will be making a new demo release. If you experienced compatability problems with q2test, or were unsatisfied with the quality in some way, you should look at the demo. The final product is much improved.\n\nQ2 Ports.\n\nWe are commited to Win32 Alpha, Linux, irix, and rhapsody in that order. It is likely that a bunch of other ports will come later, but no promises. The presence of hardware-accelerated OpenGL on a platform will improve it's odds a lot. Zoid will probably prioritize Q2 CTF over other ports, so hold off on bugging him about ports for a while.\n\nDevelopment tool release.\n\nI will basically be making publicly available a subset of the directory tree that we will deliver to our licensees. All the utility source code, the game dll source code, and probably some example source media - .map files, artwork, model source, etc.\n\nQ2 mission pack.\n\nMost of the company will be working on a mission pack while Brian and I write tools and technology for trinity.\n\nTrinity.\n\nI am going to rapidly wean myself off of working with quake so I can concentrate fully on new directions. The evolution of the Q2 codebase will be left to John Cash (until the mission pack ships) and Zoid.\n\nEveryone should keep in mind that any next-generation game that we produce is a LONG way off, so don't start getting all worked up over it, ok?\n\nFor the curious, it does look like java is going to start playing a significant role in our future projects. All of the lightweight utilities will be java applications (some requiring OpenGL bindings). The heavy duty number crunching utilities will probably stay in C. It is still unclear how much of the game framework and the level editor we can get away with doing in java."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 881038800, "contents": "A couple things I forgot to mention:\n\nDOOM source. Still planned to be released Real Soon Now, but there is some work that needs to be done on it first to remove the sound engine, which was written by someone else.\n\nOur Quake editor. It will be released with the tools, but it really isn't going to be all that usefull to many people. Most people will be better off with one of the actively supported editors designed for normal machines.\n\nThere is no documentation (Steve Tietze at Rogue has talked about writing something, though). It is designed to run at 1280*1024 resolution on a fast, fully-compliant OpenGL driver. It was designed for high-end boards like intergraph realizm, 3DPro, and Glint boards, but it also runs ok on 8 mb consumer boards like the permedia II and rendition V2200. It will NOT work with voodoo or powerVR. It is unlikely to work with voodoo rush, because of framebuffer size limits, but it might work at a low screen resolution. It might be workable on RIVA cards if they do some fancy work disposing buffers between window renderings (they are a 4mb card, but the textures can stay in AGP memory, so it will almost be enough). I'll work with them if they want to give it a try.\n\nRight now, only 3Dlabs has a full opengl driver on win-95 (and it is a little flaky). All the other cards would require you to run NT. Over the next several months, most of the major vendors should be releasing full OpenGL drivers that work in '95, but there are no firm release dates.\n\nA comment to the people complaining about the release not having Their-Favorite-Feature:\n\nA software project is never, ever completely finished. If you wait until EVERYTHING is done, you won't ship at all.\n\nWould it have been the right thing to delay releasing Quake 1 until I had written the glquake code and the QuakeWorld code? Or we had gotten Paul to build us all new models? Or we had made all new maps that hang together thematically?\n\nIf we had, we would be releasing Quake right about now. It would be a much better game (it would be Quake 2), but all of the enjoyment that everyone has gotten from Quake would have been lost. It would have been the wrong decision.\n\nQuake 2 is great, and it will get better yet after its release.\n\nA reminder about \"John Carmacks\":\n\nAnyone claiming to be me on IRC is lying. I have never been on IRC, and if I ever choose to, I will mention it here first.\n\nIf you get an unsolicited email from \"John Carmack\", the odds are high that it was spoofed.

I thought the QuakeWorld master server code was completely disabled, because I was planning on putting a modified architecture in place in the point release. It turns out that the code is still in there, sending heartbeats to a unix machine here at id that isn't even running a master server.\n\nThat wouldn't normally be an issue - a packet every five minutes from all the servers.\n\nExcept...\n\nCyrix has a new processor that is significantly faster at single precision floating point calculations if you don't do any double precision calculations anywhere.\n\nQuake had always kept its timebase as a double precision seconds value, but I agreed to change it over to an integer millisecond timer to allow the global setting of single precision mode.\n\nWe went through and changed all the uses of it that we found, but the routine that sends heartbeats to the master servers was missed.\n\nSo, instead of sending a packet every 300 seconds, it is sending one every 300 MILLISECONDS.\n\nOops.\n\nTo a server, it won't really make a difference. A tiny extra packet three times a second is a fraction of the bandwidth of a player.\n\nHowever, if there are thousands of network games in progress, that is a LOT of packets flooding idsoftware.com.\n\nSo, please download the new executable if you are going to run any servers (even servers started through the menus).\n\nftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2_306.zip\n\nThis isn't the real point release - there are no new features or bugfixes. I just went back to the release codebase and recompiled with one function commented out so we wouldn't have to worry about introducing new bugs with our current untested code.\n\nBtw, all bug reports should go to Christian (xian@idsoftware.com), NOT to me, Brian, or Cash!

The DOOM source code is released for your non-profit use. You still need real DOOM data to work with this code. If you don't actually own a real copy of one of the DOOMs, you should still be able to find them at software stores.\n\nMany thanks to Bernd Kreimeier for taking the time to clean up the project and make sure that it actually works. Projects tends to rot if you leave it alone for a few years, and it takes effort for someone to deal with it again.\n\nThe bad news: this code only compiles and runs on linux. We couldn't release the dos code because of a copyrighted sound library we used (wow, was that a mistake - I write my own sound code now), and I honestly don't even know what happened to the port that microsoft did to windows.\n\nStill, the code is quite portable, and it should be straightforward to bring it up on just about any platform.\n\nI wrote this code a long, long time ago, and there are plenty of things that seem downright silly in retrospect (using polar coordinates for clipping comes to mind), but overall it should still be a usefull base to experiment and build on.\n\nThe basic rendering concept - horizontal and vertical lines of constant Z with fixed light shading per band was dead-on, but the implementation could be improved dramatically from the original code if it were revisited. The way the rendering proceded from walls to floors to sprites could be collapsed into a single front-to-back walk of the bsp tree to collect information, then draw all the contents of a subsector on the way back up the tree. It requires treating floors and ceilings as polygons, rather than just the gaps between walls, and it requires clipping sprite billboards into subsector fragments, but it would be The Right Thing.\n\nThe movement and line of sight checking against the lines is one of the bigger misses that I look back on. It is messy code that had some failure cases, and there was a vastly simpler (and faster) solution sitting in front of my face. I used the BSP tree for rendering things, but I didn't realize at the time that it could also be used for environment testing. Replacing the line of sight test with a bsp line clip would be pretty easy. Sweeping volumes for movement gets a bit tougher, and touches on many of the challenges faced in quake / quake2 with edge bevels on polyhedrons.\n\nSome project ideas:\n\nPort it to your favorite operating system.\n\nAdd some rendering features - transparency, look up / down, slopes, etc.\n\nAdd some game features - weapons, jumping, ducking, flying, etc.\n\nCreate a packet server based internet game.\n\nCreate a client / server based internet game.\n\nDo a 3D accelerated version. On modern hardware (fast pentium + 3DFX) you probably wouldn't even need to be clever - you could just draw the entire level and get reasonable speed. With a touch of effort, it should easily lock at 60 fps (well, there are some issues with DOOM's 35 hz timebase..). The biggest issues would probably be the non-power of two texture sizes and the walls composed of multiple textures.\n\nI don't have a real good guess at how many people are going to be playing with this, but if significant projects are undertaken, it would be cool to see a level of community cooperation. I know that most early projects are going to be rough hacks done in isolation, but I would be very pleased to see a coordinated 'net release of an improved, backwards compatable version of DOOM on multiple platforms next year.\n\nHave fun.\n\nJohn Carmack 12-23-97"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 883026000, "contents": "We are going to release a new quake 2 executable that fixes the malicious server crashing problems Real Soon Now.

I am fairly confidant we will have it released to the public on sunday.\n\nI have been spending most of my time on trinity research but I have still made quite a few fixes to Q2. John Cash has made many more (he is just finishing up the IPX coding, among other things).\n\nI have been doing a lot of testing over a proxy that gives me a very bad ping (400 - 800), so I was able to find and fix two significant errors with the prediction code.\n\nThe reason why you get a jerk when running forward and firing rockets, blasters, or grenades is that the client side prediction code was blocking you on your own missiles.\n\nThe jerky behavior on plats was due to a subtle error in the prediction error interpolation.

If they are the wrong version, they will tie that slot up until they time out ot abort the connection process.\n\nI am going to force clients to send their version number with the connection request, so that bad clients will never take up slots.\n\nThat will require everyone to upgrade to 3.09 to play.\n\nI apologize for the flurry of versions, but this was a forced set of releases due to the server attacks, and lots of people are on vacation here. It certainly could have been tested better, but I thought it better to try and get something out ASAP.\n\nCheck back in the morning for a new version...\n\nBTW, we will release the new gamex86 source code after we are convinced that we aren't going to be making another patch for a couple weeks."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 883371600, "contents": "** Dec 29, 2:25 AM CST **\n\nnew version:\n\nftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2-309.exe\n\nThis one has an install that makes sure things get where they need to...\n\n\n** Dec 29: 2:30 PM CST **\n\nThe only widely reported problem with 3.09 is that the video playback is choppy.

If one of the polling websites would pose the question, I would apreciate it.\n\nA more liesurely patch release would allow us more testing time, and some problems (like this cinematic bug) would certainly be killed before the public saw it, but I definately found a couple things from the public that no amount of testing on our machines would have found. Some things only showed up with 48 people playing on our servers for several hours.\n\nOnce again, we really didn't have a choice this time because of the server crashers, but we are planning another release in two to three weeks.\n\nI am happy to produce new versions fairly rapidly, rather than at monthly intervals, but I know that many people are getting a little irate at having to download new patches.

I suppose it has never been stated directly, so here goes:\n\nQuake needs all the bandwidth that a modem connection provides to play well. Any other program accessing the internet is going to cause a degredation in gameplay, sometimes severe.\n\nSo quit IRC, ICQ, email, and web browsers before setting out for serious net play unless you have ISDN or better.\n\n\n** Dec 31: 12:41 PM CST: **\n\nI just spent a few hours working with a quake player that still couldn't net quake with 3.09.\n\nIt took a while, but I finally understand what is going on.\n\nHe could play net games on his local lan, but when he tried to connect to remote servers, it would always fail and timeout midway through the connection process, or at most a few seconds into the game.\n\nThe situation was that there was a small network of computers connected to an ISDN router that did address translation.\n\nAddress translation allows multiple computers to use the internet through a single TCP/IP address. This is accomplished by having the router perform some \"invisible\" port and ip renaming on everything that goes out.\n\nI think that is a rather evil thing for a router to do, but I suppose I can see the incentive from an address pressure viewpoint.\n\nRouters know when TCP streams begin and end, so they make sure the port mappings stay constant through the entire thing, but quake uses UDP packets (anyone who suggests using TCP for a realtime game does not understand how the error recovery works), and the router apears to be making the incorrect assumption that UDP is only used for simple request / response protocols.\n\nThe router changes the UDP port while you are playing.\n\nGrrrr.\n\nNow, a smarter router would only change the port numbers when it was actually forced to by a collision, which would only be when a connection was first opened, and everything would work out ok.\n\nAfter I understood what was happening, I could devise a fix for it. My simple fix was to make the server simply ignore the port number for client comparisons, and assume that if a packet came from the same IP address, then it is the same player even if the port number changed. That worked, and he was able to connect in to my modified server.\n\nThat has the distinct drawback of making translating routers or proxies that do the port mapping correctly unusable by more than one player at a time.\n\nI could fix it completely by including a sort of port number in each message, and having the servers match and update UDP ports based on that. That would work fine, but at the cost of adding a byte or two to everyone's packets to help out people with bad routers. You wouldn't be able to tell a difference, but its the principle of it...\n\nI could make a server side cvar to force port fixing on, but that would still not work for one class of users or the other.\n\nI could make it client settable and have the client tell the server on connect that it needs port fixing. That would work with no bandwidth cost to anyone, but it would require users to know that if they can't connect to servers, then they should try to use the fix translation option. Unfortunately, I bet that there are some routers that exhibit this problem much less often. A drop every ten minutes would be hard to attribute.\n\nI could make port fixing on by default, but if anyone is on a translated lan and another person tries to start a net quake game to the same server then they will both collide and crash and burn.\n\nI am probably going to add the extra bytes to every packet. Being automatically robust on more people's systems is probably worth a microscopic loss of bandwidth. Two bytes is under one millisecond of ping on a modem.\n\nIf there is some magic range of port values that I can use to make these routers act better, let me know.\n\nThese changes will break the connection protocol again, so I am going to hold off on the patch for a while."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 883630800, "contents": "Some of the things I have changed recently:\n\n* fixed the cinematics\n* don't clear config after dedicated server\n* don't reallocate sockets unless needed\n* don't process channel packets while connecting\n* rate variable for modem bandwidth choking\n* delta compress client usercmds\n* fixed sound quality changing after intermissions\n* fixed PVS problem when head was directly under solid in GL\n* added r_drawflat and cl_testlights to cheats\n\nThere are a few problems that I am still trying to track down:\n\nWSAEADDRNOTAVAIL errors\nMap versions differ error\nSometimes connecting and seeing messages but not getting in\nDecompression read overrun.\n\nOf course, we don't actually get any of those errors on any of our systems here, so I am having to work remotely with other users to try and fix them, which is a bit tougher.\n\nMy new years resolution is to improve my coding style by bracing all single line statements and consistantly using following caps on multi word variable names.\n\nActually, I am currently trying on the full sun coding style, but I'm not so sure about some of the comment conventions: don't use multiple lines of // comments, and don't use rows of seperating characters in comments.

The significant thing is that it has full length PCI slots, so I was able to put an Evans & Sutherland OpenGL accelerator in it (not enough room for an intergraph Realizm, though), and still drive the internal LCD screen. It works out pretty well, but I'm sure there will be conventional laptops with good 3D acceleration available later this year.\n\nThis will be an interesting experiment for me.

This is to allow you to create commands for the server operator to type, as opposed to commands that a client would type (which are defined in g_cmds.c).\n\n---\n\nWe did a bunch of profiling today, and finaly got the information I wanted. We weren't doing anything brain dead stupid in the server, and all of the time was pretty much where I expected it to be.\n\nI did found two things we can pursue for optimization.\n\nA moderately expensive catagorization function is called at both the beginning and end of client movement simulation. With some care, we should be able to avoid the first one most of the time. That alone should be good for a >10% server speedup.\n\nThe other major thing is that the client movement simulation accounted for 60% of the total execution time, and because it was already compartmentalized for client side prediction, it would not be much work to make it thread safe. Unfortunately, it would require MAJOR rework of the server code (and some of the game dll) to allow multiple client commands to run in parallel.\n\nThe potential is there to double the peak load that a server can carry if you have multiple processors. Note that you will definately get more players / system by just running multiple independent servers, rather than trying to get them all into a single large server.\n\nWe are not going to pursue either of these optimizations right now, but they will both be looked at again later.\n\nAll this optimizing of the single server is pushing the tail end of a paradigm.

In the space of a week, I only left my hotel to buy diet coke. It seems to have spoiled me a bit, the little distractions in the office grate on me a bit more since. I will likely make week long research excursions a fairly regular thing during non- crunch time. Once a quarter sounds about right.\n\nI'm not ready to talk specifically about what I am working on for trinity. Quake went through many false starts (beam trees, portals, etc) before settling down on its final architecture, so I know that the odds are good that what I am doing now won't actually be used in the final product, and I don't want to mention anything that could be taken as an implied \"promise\" by some people.\n\nI'm very excited by all the prospects, though.\n\nMany game developers are in it only for the final product, and the process is just what they have to go through to get there. I respect that, but my motivation is a bit different.\n\nFor me, while I do take a lot of pride in shipping a great product, the achievements along the way are more memorable. I don't remember any of our older product releases, but I remember the important insights all the way back to using CRTC wraparound for infinate smooth scrolling in Keen (actually, all the way back to understanding the virtues of structures over parallel arrays in apple II assembly language..). Knowledge builds on knowledge.\n\nI wind up catagorizing periods of my life by how rich my learning experiences were at the time.\n\nMy basic skills built up during school on apple II computers, but lack of resources limited how far and fast I could go. The situation is so much better for programmers today - a cheap used PC, a linux CD, and an internet account, and you have all the tools and resources necessary to work your way to any level of programming skill you want to shoot for.\n\nMy first six months at Softdisk, working on the PC, was an incredible learning experience. For the first time, I was around a couple of programmers with more experience than I had (Romero and Lane Roath), there were a lot of books and materials available, and I could devote my full and undivided attention to programming. I had a great time.\n\nThe two years following, culminating in DOOM and the various video game console work I did, was a steady increase in skills and knowledge along several fronts - more graphics, networking, unix, compiler writing, cross development, risc architectures, etc.\n\nThe first year of Quake's development was awesome. I got to try so many new things, and I had Michael Abrash as my sounding board. It would probably surprise many classically trained graphics programmers how little I new about conventional 3D when I wrote DOOM - hell, I had problems properly clipping wall polygons (which is where all the polar coordinate nonsense came from). Quake forced me to learn things right, as well as find some new innovations.\n\nThe last six months of Quake's development was mostly pain and suffering trying to get the damn thing finished. It was all worth it in the end, but I don't look back at it all that fondly.\n\nThe development cycle of Quake 2 had some moderate learning experiences for me (glquake, quakeworld, radiosity, openGL tool programming, win32, etc), but it also gave my mind time to sift through a lot of things before getting ready to really push ahead.\n\nI think that the upcoming development cycle for trinity is going to be at least as rewarding as Quake's was. I am reaching deep levels of understanding on some topics, and I am branching out into several completely new (non-graphics) areas for me, that should cross-polinate well with everything else I am doing.\n\nThere should also be a killer game at the end of it. :)"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 887000400, "contents": "Just got back from the Q2 wrap party in vegas that Activision threw for us.\n\nHaving a reasonable grounding in statistics and probability and no belief in luck, fate, karma, or god(s), the only casino game that interests me is blackjack.\n\nPlaying blackjack properly is a test of personal discipline.

With the currently shipping MCD GL driver on NT, it just doesn't run well at all. The performance is well below acceptable, and there are some strange mip map selection errors. We have been hearing for quite some time that ATI is working on an OpenGL ICD for both '95 and NT, but we haven't seen it yet. The rage pro supposedly has multitexture capability, which would help out quite a bit if they implement the multitexture extension. If they do a very good driver, the rage pro may get up to the performance of the rendition cards. Supports up to 16MB, which would make it good for development work if the rest of it was up to par.\n\n\n3DLabs permedia II\n------\nGood throughput, poor fillrate, fair quality, fair features.\n\nNo colored lighting blend mode, currently no mip mapping at all.\n\nSupports up to 8MB.\n\nThe only currently shipping production full ICD for '95, but a little flaky.\n\nIf 3dlabs implemented per-polygon mip mapping, they would get both a quality and a slight fillrate boost.\n\nDrivers available for WinNT on the DEC Alpha (but the alpha drivers are very flaky).\n\n\nPower VR PCX2\n-----\nPoor throughput, good fillrate, fair quality, poor features, low price.\n\nNo WinNT support.\n\nAlmost no blend modes at all, low alpha precision.\n\nEven though the hardware doesn't support multitexture, they could implement the multi-texture extension just to save on polygon setup costs. That might get them a 10% to 15% performance boost.\n\nThey could implement the point parameters extension for a significant boost in the speed of particle rendering. That wouldn't affect benchmark scores very much, but it would help out in hectic deathmatches.\n\nTheir opengl minidriver is already a fairly heroic effort - the current PVR takes a lot of beating about the head to make it act like an OpenGL accelerator.\n\n\nRendition v2100 / v2200\n--------\nGood throughput, good fillrate, very good quality, good features.\n\nA good all around chip. Not quite voodoo1 performance, but close.\n\nv2100 is simply better than everything else in the $99 price range.\n\nCan render 24 bit color for the best possible quality, but their current drivers don't support it. Future ones probably will.\n\nCan do 3D on the desktop.\n\nRendition should be shipping a full ICD OpenGL, which will make an 8mb v2200 a very good board for people doing 3D development work.\n\n\nNVidia Riva 128\n-----\nVery good throughput, very good fillrate, fair quality, fair features.\n\nThe fastest fill rate currently shipping, but it varies quite a bit based on texture size. On large textures it is slightly slower than voodoo, but on smaller textures it is over twice as fast.\n\nOn paper, their triangle throughput rate should be three times what voodoo gives, but in practice we are only seeing a slight advantage on very fast machines, and worse performance on pentium class machines. They probably have a lot of room to improve that in their drivers.\n\nIn general, it is fair to say that riva is somewhat faster than voodoo 1, but it has a few strikes against it.\n\nThe feature implementation is not complete. They have the blend mode for colored lighting, but they still don't have them all. That may hurt them in future games. Textures can only be 1 to 1 aspect ratio. In practice, that just means that non-square textures waste memory.\n\nThe rendering quality isn't quite as high as voodoo or rendition. It looks like some of their iterators don't have enough precision.\n\nNvidia is serious and committed to OpenGL. I am confident that their driver will continue to improve in both performance and robustness.\n\nWhile they can do good 3D in a window, they are limited to a max of 4MB of framebuffer, which means that they can't run at a high enough resolution to do serious work.\n\n\n3DFX Voodoo 1\n-----\nThe benchmark against which everything else is measured.\n\nGood throughput, good fillrate, good quality, good features.\n\nIt has a couple faults, but damn few: max texture size limited to 256*256 and 8 to 1 aspect ratio. Slow texture swapping. No 24 bit rendering.\n\nBecause of the slow texture swapping, anyone buying a voodoo should get a six mb board (e.g. Canopus Pure3D). The extra ram prevents some sizable jerks when textures need to be swapped.\n\nHighly tuned minidriver. They have a full ICD in alpha, but they are being slow about moving it into production. Because of the add-in board nature of the 3dfx, the ICD won't be useful for things like running level editors, but it would at least guarantee that any new features added to quake engine games won't require revving the minidriver to add new functionality.\n\n\n3DFX Voodoo 2\n-----\nNot shipping yet, but we were given permission to talk about the benchmarks on their preproduction boards.\n\nExcellent throughput, excellent fillrate, good quality, excellent features.\n\nThe numbers were far and away the best ever recorded, and they are going to get significantly better. On quake 2, voodoo 2 is setup limited, not fill rate limited. Voodoo 2 can do triangle strip and fan setup in hardware, but their opengl can't take advantage of it until the next revision of glide. When that happens, the number of vertexes being sent to the card will drop by HALF. At 640*480, they will probably become fill rate bound again (unless you interleave two boards), but at 512*384, they will probably exceed 100 fps on a timedemo. In practice, that means that you will play the game at 60 fps with hardly ever a dropped frame.\n\nThe texture swapping rate is greatly improved, addressing the only significant problem with voodoo.\n\nI expect that for games that heavily use multitexture (all quake engine games), voodoo 2 will remain the highest performer for all of '98. All you other chip companies, feel free to prove me wrong. :)\n\nLack of 24 bit rendering is the only visual negative.\n\nAs with any voodoo solution, you also give up the ability to run 3D applications on your desktop. For pure gamers, that isn't an issue, but for hobbyists that may be interested in using 3D tools it may have some weight.\n\n\nIntel i740\n----\nGood throughput, good fillrate, good quality, good features.\n\nA very competent chip. I wish intel great success with the 740. I think that it firmly establishes the baseline that other companies (especially the ones that didn't even make this list) will be forced to come up to.\n\nVoodoo rendering quality, better than voodoo1 performance, good 3D on a desktop integration, and all textures come from AGP memory so there is no texture swapping at all.\n\nLack of 24 bit rendering is the only negative of any kind I can think of.\n\nTheir current MCD OpenGL on NT runs quake 2 pretty well. I have seen their ICD driver on '95 running quake 2, and it seems to be progressing well. The chip has the potential to outperform voodoo 1 across the board, but 3DFX has more highly tuned drivers right now, giving it a performance edge. I expect intel will get the performance up before releasing the ICD.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that of all the drivers we have tested, intel's MCD was the only driver that did absolutely everything flawlessly. I hope that their ICD has a similar level of quality (it's a MUCH bigger job).\n\nAn 8mb i740 will be a very good setup for 3D development work."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 887605200, "contents": "8 mb or 12 mb voodoo 2?\n\nAn 8mb v2 has 2 mb of texture memory on each TMU. That is not as general as the current 6mb v1 cards that have 4 mb of texture memory on a single TMU. To use the multitexture capability, textures are restricted to being on one or the other TMU (simplifying a bit here). There is some benefit over only having 2 mb of memory, but it isn't double. You will see more texture swapping in quake on an 8mb voodoo 2 than you would on a 6mb voodoo 1. However, the texture swapping is several times faster, so it isn't necessarily all that bad.\n\nIf you use the 8 bit palettized textures, there will probably not be any noticable speed improvement with a 12 mb voodoo 2 vs an 8 mb one. The situation that would most stress it would be an active deathmatch that had players using every skin.

Lesson learned - we need to design more security conscious to try to protect against the assholes out there.\n\nThe cause for the upcoming 3.13 patch is the same thing that has caused us a fair amount of trouble through Q2's development - instability in the gamex86 code due to its decending from QC code in Q1. It turns out that there were lots of bugs in the original QC code, but because of its safe interpreted nature (specifically having a null entity reference the world) they never really bothered anyone.

Towards the end of Quake 1's development I was thinking that we might have been better off splitting quake on those categories, but in reverse order. Doing client/server, the better modification framework, and qc, coupled with a spiced up DOOM engine (Duke style) for one game, then doing the full 3D renderer for the following game.\n\nWe have no reason to believe that the next generation development would somehow go faster than the previous, so there is a real chance that doing all of the Trinity technology at once might push game development time to a full two years for us, which might be a bit more than the pressure-cooker work atmosphere here could handle.\n\nSo, we are going to try an experiment.\n\nThe non-graphics things that I was planning for Trinity will be held off until the following project - much java integration with client downloadable code being one of the more significant aspects. I hope to get to some next generation sound work, but the graphics engine is the only thing I am committing to.\n\nThe graphics engine is going to be hardware accelerated ONLY. NO SOFTWARE RENDERER, and it won't work very well on a lot of current hardware. We understand fully that this is going to significantly cut into our potential customer base, but everyone was tired of working under the constraints of the software renderer. There are still going to be plenty of good quake derived games to play from other developers for people without appropriate hardware.\n\nThere are some specific things that the graphics technology is leveraging that may influence your choice of a 3D accelerator.\n\nAll source artwork is being created and delivered in 24 bit color. An accelerator that can perform all 3D work in 24 bit color will look substantially better than a 16 bit card. You will pay a speed cost for it, though.\n\nMost of the textures are going to be higher resolution. Larger amounts of texture memory will make a bigger difference than it does on Quake 2.\n\nSome key rendering effects require blending modes that some cards don't support.\n\nThe fill rate requirements will be about 50% more than Quake 2, on average. Cards that are fill rate limited will slow down unless you go to a lower resolution.\n\nThe triangle rate requirements will be at least double Quake 2, and scalable to much higher levels of detail on appropriate hardware.\n\nHere are my current GUESSES about how existing cards will perform.\n\nVoodoo 1 Performance will be a little slow, but it should look good and run acceptably. You will have to use somewhat condensed textures to avoid texture thrashing.\n\nVoodoo 2 Should run great. Getting the 12 mb board is probably a good idea if you want to use the high resolution textures. The main rendering mode won't be able to take advantage of the dual TMU the same way quake 2 does, so the extra TMU will be used for slightly higher quality rendering modes instead of greater speed: trilinear / detail texturing, or some full color effects where others get a mono channel.\n\nPermedia 2 Will be completely fill rate bound, so it will basically run 2/3 the speed that quake 2 does. Not very fast. It also doesn't have one of the needed blending modes, so it won't look very good, either. P2 does support 24 bit rendering, but it won't be fast enough to use it.\n\nATI Rage Pro It looks like the rage pro has all the required blending modes, but the jury is still out on the performance.\n\nIntel I740 Should run good with all features, and because all of the textures come out of AGP memory, there will be no texture thrashing at all, even with the full resolution textures.\n\nRendition 2100/2200 The 2100 should run about the speed of a voodoo 1, and the 2200 should be faster. They support all the necessary features, and an 8 mb 2200 should be able to use the high res textures without a problem. The renditions are the only current boards that can do 24 bit rendering with all the features. It will be a bit slow in 24 bit mode, but it will look the best.\n\nPVR PCX2 Probably won't run Quake 3. They don't have ANY of the necessary blending modes, so it can't look correct. Video Logic might decide to rev their minidriver to try to support it, but it is probably futile.\n\nRIVA 128 Riva puts us in a bad position. They are very fast, but they don't support an important feature. We can crutch it up by performing some extra drawing passes, but there is a bit of a quality loss, and it will impact their speed. They will probably be a bit faster than voodoo 1, but not to the degree that they are in Quake 2.\n\nNaturally, the best cards are yet to come (I won't comment on unreleased cards). The graphics engine is being designed to be scalable over the next few YEARS, so it might look like we are shooting a bit high for the first release, but by the time it actually ships, there will be a lot of people with brand new accelerators that won't be properly exploited by any other game."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 890366400, "contents": "Robert Duffy, the maintainer of Radiant QE4 is now \"officially\" in charge of further development of the editor codebase.

Press a button and it raises two inches, which means you can actually drive it up into strip malls. The F40 had to be driven into my garage at an angle to keep the front from rubbing. This makes the car actually fairly practical for daily driving.\n\nDrastically better off idle torque. You have to rev the F40 a fair amount to even get it moving, and if you are moving at 2000 rpm in first gear, a honda can pull away from you until it starts making boost at 3500 rpm. The f50 has enough torque that you don't even need to rev to get moving, and it goes quite well by just flooring it after you are moving. No need to wreck a clutch by slipping it out from 4000 rpm.\n\nMuch nicer clutch. The F40 clutch was a very low-tech single disk clutch that required more effort than on my crazy TR with over twice the torque.\n\nBetter rearward visibility.

I got a couple months of pretty much wide open research done at the start, but it turned out that none of the early research actually had any bearing on the directions I finally decided on. Ah well, I learned a lot, and it will probably pay off at some later time.\n\nI spent a little while doing some basic research with lummigraphs, which are sort of a digital hologram. The space requirements are IMMENSE, on the order of several gigs uncompressed for even a single full sized room. I was considering the possibility of using very small lumigraph fragments (I called them \"lumigraphlets\") as imposters for large clusters of areas, similar to aproximating an area with a texture map, but it would effectively be a view dependent texture.\n\nThe results were interesting, but transitioning seamlessly would be difficult, the memory was still large, and it has all the same caching issues that any impostor scheme has.\n\nAnother aproach I worked on was basically extending the sky box code style of rendering from quake 2 into a complete rendering system. Take a large number of environment map snapshots, and render a view by interpolating between up to four maps (if in a tetrahedral arangement) based on the view position.\n\nA simple image based interpolating doesn't convey a sense of motion, because it basically just ghosts between seperate points unless the maps are VERY close together reletive to the nearest point visible in the images.\n\nIf the images that make up the environment map cube also contain depth values at some (generally lower) resolution, instead of rendering the environment map as six big flat squares at infinity, you can render it as a lot of little triangles at the proper world coordinates for the individual texture points. A single environment map like this can be walked around in and gives a sense of motion. If you have multiple maps from nearby locations, they can be easily blended together. Some effort should be made to nudge the mesh samples so that as many points are common between the maps as possible, but even a regular grid works ok.\n\nYou get texture smearing when occluded detail should be revealed, and if you move too far from the original camera point the textures blur out a lot, but it is still a very good effect, is completely complexity insensitive, and is aliasing free except when the view position causes a silhouette crease in the depth data.\n\nEven with low res environment maps like in Quake2, each snapshot would consume 700k, so taking several hundred environment images throughout a level would generate too much data. Obviously there is a great deal of redundancy - you will have several environment maps that contain the same wall image, for instance. I had an interesting idea for compressing it all. If you ignore specular lighting and atmospheric effects, any surface that is visible in multiple environment maps can be represented by a single copy of it and perspective transformation of that image. Single image, transformations, sounds like.. fractal compression. Normal fractal compression only deals with affine maps, but the extension to projective maps seems logical.\n\nI think that a certain type of game could be done with a technology like that, but in the end, I didn't think it was the right direction for a first person shooter.\n\nThere is a tie in between lummigraphs, multiple environment maps, specularity, convolution, and dynamic indirect lighting. Its nagging at me, but it hasn't come completely clear.\n\nOther topics for when I get the time to write more:\n\nMicro environment map based model lighting. Convolutions of environment maps by phong exponent, exponent of one with normal vector is diffuse lighting.\n\nFull surface texture representation. Interior antaliasing with edge matched texels.\n\nOctree represented surface voxels. Drawing and tracing.\n\nBump mapping, and why most of the aproaches being suggested for hardware are bogus.\n\nParametric patches vs implicit functions vs subdivision surfaces.\n\nWhy all analytical boundary representations basically suck.\n\nFinite element radiosity vs photon tracing.\n\netc."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 895377600, "contents": "Here is an example of some bad programming in quake:\n\nThere are three places where text input is handled in the game: the console, the chat line, and the menu fields.

I foudn out a few interesting things:\n\nMouse sampling on win95 only happens every 25ms. It doesn't matter if you check the cursor or use DirectInput, the values will only change 40 times a second.\n\nThis means that with normal checking, the mouse control will feel slightly stuttery whenever the framerate is over 20 fps, because on some frames you will be getting one input sample, and on other frames you will be getting two. The difference between two samples and three isn't very noticable, so it isn't much of an issue below 20 fps. Above 40 fps it is a HUGE issue, because the frames will be bobbing between one sample and zero samples.\n\nI knew there were some sampling quantization issues early on, so I added the \"m_filter 1\" variable, but it really wasn't an optimal solution. It averaged together the samples collected at the last two frames, which worked out ok if the framerate stayed consistantly high and you were only averaging together one to three samples, but when the framerate dropped to 10 fps or so, you wound up averaging together a dozen more samples than were really needed, giving the \"rubber stick\" feel to the mouse control.\n\nI now have three modes of mouse control:\n\nin_mouse 1: Mouse control with standard win-32 cursor calls, just like Quake 2.\n\nin_mouse 2: Mouse control using DirectInput to sample the mouse relative counters each frame. This behaves like winquake with -dinput. There isn't a lot of difference between this and 1, but you get a little more precision, and you never run into window clamping issues. If at some point in the future microsoft changes the implementation of DirectInput so that it processes all pending mouse events exactly when the getState call happens, this will be the ideal input mode.\n\nin_mouse 3: Processes DirectInput mouse movement events, and filters the amount of movement over the next 25 milliseconds. This effectively adds about 12 ms of latency to the mouse control, but the movement is smooth and consistant at any variable frame rate. This will be the default for Quake 3, but some people may want the 12ms faster (but rougher) response time of mode 2.\n\nIt takes a pretty intense player to even notice the difference in most cases, but if you have a setup that can run a very consistant 30 fps you will probably apreciate the smoothness. At 60 fps, anyone can tell the difference, but rendering speeds will tend to cause a fair amount of jitter at those rates no matter what the mouse is doing.\n\nDirectInput on WindowsNT does not log mouse events as they happen, but seems to just do a poll when called, so they can't be filtered properly.\n\nKeyboard sampling appears to be millisecond precise on both OS, though.\n\nIn doing this testing, it has become a little bit more tempting to try to put in more leveling optimizations to allow 60 hz framerates on the highest end hardware, but I have always shied away from targeting very high framerates as a goal, because when you miss by a tiny little bit, the drop from 60 to 30 ( 1 to 2 vertical retraces ) fps is extremely noticable.\n\n-\n\nI have also concluded that the networking architecture for Quake 2 was just not the right thing. The interpolating 10 hz server made a lot of animation easier, which fit with the single player focus, but it just wasn't a good thing for internet play.\n\nQuake 3 will have an all new entity communication mechanism that should be solidly better than any previous system. I have some new ideas that go well beyond the previous work that I did on QuakeWorld.\n\nIts tempting to try to roll the new changes back into Quake 2, but a lot of them are pretty fundamental, and I'm sure we would bust a lot of important single player stuff while gutting the network code.\n\n(Yes, we made some direction changes in Quake 3 since the original announcement when it was to be based on the Quake 2 game and networking with just a new graphics engine)"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 897969600, "contents": "My last two .plan updates have described efforts that were not in our original plan for quake 3, which was \"quake 2 game and network technology with a new graphics engine\".\n\nWe changed our minds.\n\nThe new product is going to be called \"Quake Arena\", and will consist exclusively of deathmatch style gaming (including CTF and other derivatives). The single player game will just be a progression through a ranking ladder against bot AIs. We think that can still be made an enjoyable game, but it is definately a gamble.\n\nIn the past, we have always been designing two games at once, the single player game and the multi player game, and they often had conflicting goals. For instance, the client-server communications channel discouraged massive quantities of moving entities that would have been interesting in single player, while the maps and weapons designed for single player were not ideal for multiplayer. The largest conflict was just raw development time. Time spent on monsters is time not spent on player movement. Time spent on unit goals is time not spent on game rules.\n\nThere are many wonderful gaming experiences in single player FPS, but we are choosing to leave them behind to give us a purity of focus that will let us make significant advances in the multiplayer experience.\n\nThe emphasis will be on making every aspect as robust and high quality as possible, rather than trying to add every conceivable option anyone could want. We will not be trying to take the place of every mod ever produced, but we hope to satisfy a large part of the network gaming audience with the out of box experience.\n\nThere is a definite effect on graphics technology decisions. Much of the positive feedback in a single player FPS is the presentation of rich visual scenes, which are often at the expense of framerate.

The idea is to have one processor doing all the game processing, database traversal, and lighting, while the other processor does absolutely nothing but issue OpenGL calls.\n\nThis effectively treats the second processor as a dedicated geometry accelerator for the 3D card. This can only improve performance if the card isn't the bottleneck, but voodoo2 and TNT cards aren't hitting their limits at 640*480 on even very fast processors right now.\n\nFor single player games where there is a lot of cpu time spent running the server, there could conceivably be up to an 80% speed improvement, but for network games and timedemos a more realistic goal is a 40% or so speed increase. I will be very satisfied if I can makes a dual pentium-pro 200 system perform like a pII-300.\n\nI started on the specialized code in the renderer, but it struck me that it might be possible to implement SMP acceleration with a generic OpenGL driver, which would allow Quake2 / sin / halflife to take advantage of it well before QuakeArena ships.\n\nIt took a day of hacking to get the basic framework set up: an smpgl.dll that spawns another thread that loads the original oepngl32.dll or 3dfxgl.dll, and watches a work que for all the functions to call.\n\nI get it basically working, then start doing some timings. Its 20% slower than the single processor version.\n\nI go in and optimize all the queing and working functions, tune the communications facilities, check for SMP cache collisions, etc.\n\nAfter a day of optimizing, I finally squeak out some performance gains on my tests, but they aren't very impressive: 3% to 15% on one test scene, but still slower on the another one.\n\nThis was fairly depressing. I had always been able to get pretty much linear speedups out of the multithreaded utilities I wrote, even up to sixteen processors. The difference is that the utilities just split up the work ahead of time, then don't talk to each other until they are done, while here the two threads work in a high bandwidth producer / consumer relationship.\n\nI finally got around to timing the actual communication overhead, and I was appalled: it was taking 12 msec to fill the que, and 17 msec to read it out on a single frame, even with nothing else going on. I'm surprised things got faster at all with that much overhead.\n\nThe test scene I was using created about 1.5 megs of data to relay all the function calls and vertex data for a frame. That data had to go to main memory from one processor, then back out of main memory to the other. Admitedly, it is a bitch of a scene, but that is where you want the acceleration..\n\nThe write times could be made over twice as fast if I could turn on the PII's write combining feature on a range of memory, but the reads (which were the gating factor) can't really be helped much.\n\nStreaming large amounts of data to and from main memory can be really grim. The next write may force a cache writeback to make room for it, then the read from memory to fill the cacheline (even if you are going to write over the entire thing), then eventually the writeback from the cache to main memory where you wanted it in the first place. You also tend to eat one more read when your program wants to use the original data that got evicted at the start.\n\nWhat is really needed for this type of interface is a streaming read cache protocol that performs similarly to the write combining: three dedicated cachelines that let you read or write from a range without evicting other things from the cache, and automatically prefetching the next cacheline as you read.\n\nIntel's write combining modes work great, but they can't be set directly from user mode. All drivers that fill DMA buffers (like OpenGL ICDs..) should definately be using them, though.\n\nPrefetch instructions can help with the stalls, but they still don't prevent all the wasted cache evictions.\n\nIt might be possible to avoid main memory alltogether by arranging things so that the sending processor ping-pongs between buffers that fit in L2, but I'm not sure if a cache coherent read on PIIs just goes from one L2 to the other, or if it becomes a forced memory transaction (or worse, two memory transactions). It would also limit the maximum amount of overlap in some situations. You would also get cache invalidation bus traffic.\n\nI could probably trim 30% of my data by going to a byte level encoding of all the function calls, instead of the explicit function pointer / parameter count / all-parms-are-32-bits that I have now, but half of the data is just raw vertex data, which isn't going to shrink unless I did evil things like quantize floats to shorts.\n\nToo much effort for what looks like a reletively minor speedup. I'm giving up on this aproach, and going back to explicit threading in the renderer so I can make most of the communicated data implicit.\n\nOh well. It was amusing work, and I learned a few things along the way."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 908337600, "contents": "It has been difficult to write .plan updates lately. Every time I start writing something, I realize that I'm not going to be able to cover it satisfactorily in the time I can spend on it. I have found that terse little comments either get misinterpreted, or I get deluged by email from people wanting me to expand upon it.\n\nI wanted to do a .plan about my evolving thoughts on code quality and lessons learned through quake and quake 2, but in the interest of actually completing an update, I decided to focus on one change that was intended to just clean things up, but had a surprising number of positive side effects.\n\nSince DOOM, our games have been defined with portability in mind. Porting to a new platform involves having a way to display output, and having the platform tell you about the various relevant inputs. There are four principle inputs to a game: keystrokes, mouse moves, network packets, and time. (If you don't consider time an input value, think about it until you do - it is an important concept)\n\nThese inputs were taken in separate places, as seemed logical at the time. A function named Sys_SendKeyEvents() was called once a frame that would rummage through whatever it needed to on a system level, and call back into game functions like Key_Event( key, down ) and IN_MouseMoved( dx, dy ). The network system dropped into system specific code to check for the arrival of packets. Calls to Sys_Milliseconds() were littered all over the code for various reasons.\n\nI felt that I had slipped a bit on the portability front with Q2 because I had been developing natively on windows NT instead of cross developing from NEXTSTEP, so I was reevaluating all of the system interfaces for Q3.\n\nI settled on combining all forms of input into a single system event queue, similar to the windows message queue. My original intention was to just rigorously define where certain functions were called and cut down the number of required system entry points, but it turned out to have much stronger benefits.\n\nWith all events coming through one point (The return values from system calls, including the filesystem contents, are \"hidden\" inputs that I make no attempt at capturing, ), it was easy to set up a journalling system that recorded everything the game received. This is very different than demo recording, which just simulates a network level connection and lets time move at its own rate. Realtime applications have a number of unique development difficulties because of the interaction of time with inputs and outputs.\n\nTransient flaw debugging. If a bug can be reproduced, it can be fixed. The nasty bugs are the ones that only happen every once in a while after playing randomly, like occasionally getting stuck on a corner. Often when you break in and investigate it, you find that something important happened the frame before the event, and you have no way of backing up. Even worse are realtime smoothness issues - was that jerk of his arm a bad animation frame, a network interpolation error, or my imagination?\n\nAccurate profiling. Using an intrusive profiler on Q2 doesn't give accurate results because of the realtime nature of the simulation. If the program is running half as fast as normal due to the instrumentation, it has to do twice as much server simulation as it would if it wasn't instrumented, which also goes slower, which compounds the problem. Aggressive instrumentation can slow it down to the point of being completely unplayable.\n\nRealistic bounds checker runs. Bounds checker is a great tool, but you just can't interact with a game built for final checking, its just waaaaay too slow. You can let a demo loop play back overnight, but that doesn't exercise any of the server or networking code.\n\nThe key point: Journaling of time along with other inputs turns a realtime application into a batch process, with all the attendant benefits for quality control and debugging. These problems, and many more, just go away. With a full input trace, you can accurately restart the session and play back to any point (conditional breakpoint on a frame number), or let a session play back at an arbitrarily degraded speed, but cover exactly the same code paths..\n\nI'm sure lots of people realize that immediately, but it only truly sunk in for me recently. In thinking back over the years, I can see myself feeling around the problem, implementing partial journaling of network packets, and included the \"fixedtime\" cvar to eliminate most timing reproducibility issues, but I never hit on the proper global solution. I had always associated journaling with turning an interactive application into a batch application, but I never considered the small modification necessary to make it applicable to a realtime application.\n\nIn fact, I was probably blinded to the obvious because of one of my very first successes: one of the important technical achievements of Commander Keen 1 was that, unlike most games of the day, it adapted its play rate based on the frame speed (remember all those old games that got unplayable when you got a faster computer?). I had just resigned myself to the non-deterministic timing of frames that resulted from adaptive simulation rates, and that probably influenced my perspective on it all the way until this project.\n\nIts nice to see a problem clearly in its entirety for the first time, and know exactly how to address it."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 910069200, "contents": "This was the most significant thing I talked about at The Frag, so here it is for everyone else.\n\nThe way the QA game architecture has been developed so far has been as two seperate binary dll's: one for the server side game logic, and one for the client side presentation logic.\n\nWhile it was easiest to begin development like that, there are two crucial problems with shipping the game that way: security and portability.\n\nIt's one thing to ask the people who run dedicated servers to make informed decisions about the safety of a given mod, but its a completely different matter to auto-download a binary image to a first time user connecting to a server they found.\n\nThe quake 2 server crashing attacks have certainly proven that there are hackers that enjoy attacking games, and shipping around binary code would be a very tempting opening for them to do some very nasty things.\n\nWith quake and Quake 2, all game modifications were strictly server side, so any port of the game could connect to any server without problems. With Quake 2's binary server dll's not all ports could necessarily run a server, but they could all play.\n\nWith significant chunks of code now running on the client side, if we stuck with binary dll's then the less popular systems would find that they could not connect to new servers because the mod code hadn't been ported. I considered having things set up in such a way that client game dll's could be sort of forwards-compatable, where they could always connect and play, but new commands and entity types just might now show up. We could also GPL the game code to force mod authors to release source with the binaries, but that would still be inconvenient to deal with all the porting.\n\nRelated both issues is client side cheating. Certain cheats are easy to do if you can hack the code, so the server will need to verify which code the client is running. With multiple ported versions, it wouldn't be possible to do any binary verification.\n\nIf we were willing to wed ourselves completely to the windows platform, we might have pushed ahead with some attempt at binary verification of dlls, but I ruled that option out. I want QuakeArena running on every platform that has hardware accelerated OpenGL and an internet connection.\n\nThe only real solution to these problems is to use an interpreted language like Quake 1 did. I have reached the conclusion that the benefits of a standard language outweigh the benefits of a custom language for our purposes. I would not go back and extend QC, because that stretches the effort from simply system and interpreter design to include language design, and there is already plenty to do.\n\nI had been working under the assumption that Java was the right way to go, but recently I reached a better conclusion.\n\nThe programming language for QuakeArena mods is interpreted ANSI C. (well, I am dropping the double data type, but otherwise it should be pretty conformant)\n\nThe game will have an interpreter for a virtual RISC-like CPU. This should have a minor speed benefit over a byte-coded, stack based java interpreter. Loads and stores are confined to a preset block of memory, and access to all external system facilities is done with system traps to the main game code, so it is completely secure.\n\nThe tools necessary for building mods will all be freely available: a modified version of LCC and a new program called q3asm. LCC is a wonderful project - a cross platform, cross compiling ANSI C compiler done in under 20K lines of code. Anyone interested in compilers should pick up a copy of \"A retargetable C compiler: design and implementation\" by Fraser and Hanson.\n\nYou can't link against any libraries, so every function must be resolved. Things like strcmp, memcpy, rand, etc. must all be implemented directly. I have code for all the ones I use, but some people may have to modify their coding styles or provide implementations for other functions.\n\nIt is a fair amount of work to restructure all the interfaces to not share pointers between the system and the games, but it is a whole lot easier than porting everything to a new language. The client game code is about 10k lines, and the server game code is about 20k lines.\n\nThe drawback is performance. It will probably perform somewhat like QC. Most of the heavy lifting is still done in the builtin functions for path tracing and world sampling, but you could still hurt yourself by looping over tons of objects every frame. Yes, this does mean more load on servers, but I am making some improvements in other parts that I hope will balance things to about the way Q2 was on previous generation hardware.\n\nThere is also the amusing avenue of writing hand tuned virtual assembly assembly language for critical functions..\n\nI think this is The Right Thing."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 910155600, "contents": "More extensive comments on the interpreted-C decision later, but a quick note: the plan is to still allow binary dll loading so debuggers can be used, but it should be interchangable with the interpreted code.

Most mods will be able to be implemented with just the interpreter, but some mods that want to do extensive file access or out of band network communications could still be implemented just as they are in Q2.

Store instructions from the VM would be confined to the interpreter's address space, but loads could access any structures.\n\nOn the positive side:\n\nThis would allow full speed (well, full interpreted speed) access to variables shared between the main code and the interpreted modules. This allows system calls to return pointers, instead of filling in allocated space in the interpreter's address space.\n\nFor most things, this is just a convenience that will cut some development time. Most of the shared accesses could be recast as \"get\" system calls, and it is certainly arguable that that would be a more robust programming style.\n\nThe most prevelent change this would prevent is all the cvar_t uses. Things could stay in the same style as Q2, where cvar accesses are free and transparantly updated. If the interpreter lives only in its own address space, then cvar access would have to be like Q1, where looking up a variable is a potentially time consuming operation, and you wind up adding lots of little cvar caches that are updated every from or restart.\n\nOn the negative side:\n\nA client game module with a bug could cause a bus error, which would not be possible with a pure local address space interpreter.\n\nI can't think of any exploitable security problems that read only access to the entire address space opens, but if anyone thinks of something, let me know."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 914994000, "contents": "I got several vague comments about being able to read \"stuff\" from shared memory, but no concrete examples of security problems.\n\nHowever, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that it wouldn't work cross platform with 64 bit pointer environments like linux alpha.

Some information is probably going to get distorted in the spinning and retelling, so here is an info dump straight from me:\n\nQ3test, and later the full commercial Quake3: Arena, will be simultaniously released on windows, mac, and linux platforms.\n\nI think Apple is doing a lot of things right. A lot of what they are doing now is catch-up to wintel, but if they can keep it up for the next year, they may start making a really significant impact.\n\nI still can't give the mac an enthusiastic recommendation for sophisticated users right now because of the operating system issues, but they are working towards correcting that with MacOS X.\n\nThe scoop on the new G3 mac hardware:\n\nBasically, its a great system, but Apple has oversold its performance reletive to intel systems. In terms of timedemo scores, the new G3 systems should be near the head of the pack, but there will be intel systems outperforming them to some degree. The mac has not instantly become a \"better\" platform for games than wintel, it has just made a giant leap from the back of the pack to near the front.\n\nI wish Apple would stop quoting \"Bytemarks\". I need to actually look at the contents of that benchmark and see how it can be so misleading. It is pretty funny listening to mac evangelist types try to say that an iMac is faster than a pentium II-400. Nope. Not even close.\n\nFrom all of my tests and experiments, the new mac systems are basically as fast as the latest pentium II systems for general cpu and memory performance. This is plenty good, but it doesn't make the intel processors look like slugs.\n\nSure, an in-cache, single precision, multiply-accumulate loop could run twice as fast as a pentium II of the same clock rate, but conversly, a double precision add loop would run twice as fast on the pentium II.\n\nSpec95 is a set of valid benchmarks in my opinion, and I doubt the PPC systems significantly (if at all) outperform the intel systems.\n\nThe IO system gets mixed marks. The 66 mhz video slot is a good step up from 33 mhz pci in previous products, but that's still half the bandwidth of AGP 2X, and it can't texture from main memory. This will have a small effect on 3D gaming, but not enough to push it out of its class.\n\nThe 64 bit pci slots are a good thing for network and storage cards, but the memory controller doesn't come close to getting peak utilization out of it. Better than normal pci, though.\n\nThe video card is almost exactly what you will be able to get on the pc side: a 16 mb rage-128. Running on a 66mhz pci bus, it's theoretical peak performance will be midway between the pci and agp models on pc systems for command traffic limited scenes. Note that current games are not actually command traffic limited, so the effect will be significantly smaller. The fill rates will be identical.\n\nThe early systems are running the card at 75 mhz, which does put it at a slight disadvantage to the TNT, but faster versions are expected later. As far as I can tell, the rage-128 is as perfect as the TNT feature-wise. The 32 mb option is a feature ATI can hold over TNT.\n\nFirewire is cool.\n\nIts a simple thing, but the aspect of the new G3 systems that struck me the most was the new case design. Not the flashy plastic exterior, but the functional structure of it. The side of the system just pops open, even with the power on, and lays the motherboard and cards down flat while the disks and power supply stay in the encloser. It really is a great design, and the benefits were driven home yesterday when I had to scavenge some ram out of old wintel systems yesterday - most case designs suck really bad.\n\n-\n\nI could gripe a bit about the story of our (lack of) involvement with Apple over the last four years or so, but I'm calling that water under the bridge now.\n\nAfter all the past fiascos, I had been basically planning on ignoring Apple until MacOS X (rhapsody) shipped, which would then turn it into a platform that I was actually interested in.\n\nRecently, Apple made a strategic corporate decision that games were a fundamental part of a consumer oriented product line (duh). To help that out, Apple began an evaluation of what it needed to do to help game developers.\n\nMy first thought was \"throw out MacOS\", but they are already in the process of doing that, and its just not going to be completed overnight.\n\nApple has decent APIs for 2D graphics, input, sound, and networking, but they didn't have a solid 3D graphics strategy.\n\nRave was sort of ok. Underspecified and with no growth path, but sort of ok. Pursuing a proprietary api that wasn't competetive with other offerings would have been a Very Bad Idea. They could have tried to make it better, or even invent a brand new api, but Apple doesn't have much credebility in 3D programming.\n\nFor a while, it was looking like Apple might do something stupid, like license DirectX from microsoft and be put into a guaranteed trailing edge position behind wintel.\n\nOpenGL was an obvious direction, but there were significant issues with the licensing and implementation that would need to be resolved.\n\nI spent a day at apple with the various engineering teams and executives, laying out all the issues.\n\nThe first meeting didn't seem like it went all that well, and there wasn't a clear direction visible for the next two months. Finally, I got the all clear signal that OpenGL was a go and that apple would be getting both the sgi codebase and the conix codebease and team (the best possible arrangement).\n\nSo, I got a mac and started developing on it. My first weekend of effort had QuakeArena limping along while held together with duct tape, but weekend number two had it properly playable, and weekend number three had it brought up to full feature compatability. I still need to do some platform specific things with odd configurations like multi monitor and addon controlers, but basically now its just a matter of compiling on the mac to bring it up to date.\n\nThis was important to me, because I felt that Quake2 had slipped a bit in portability because it had been natively developed on windows. I like the discipline of simultanious portable development.\n\nAfter 150 hours or so of concentrated mac development, I learned a lot about the platform.\n\nCodeWarrior is pretty good. I was comfortable devloping there almost immediately. I would definately say VC++ 6.0 is a more powerful overall tool, but CW has some nice little aspects that I like. I am definately looking forward to CW for linux. Unix purists may be aghast, but I have allways liked gui dev environments more than a bunch of xterms running vi and gdb.\n\nThe hardware (even the previous generation stuff) is pretty good.\n\nThe OpenGL performance is pretty good. There is a lot of work underway to bring the OpenGL performance to the head of the pack, but the existing stuff works fine for development.\n\nThe low level operating systems SUCKS SO BAD it is hard to believe.\n\nThe first order problem is lack of memory management / protection.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out that the zen of mac development is \"be at peace while rebooting\". I rebooted my mac system more times the first weekend than I have rebooted all the WinNT systems I have ever owned. True, it has gotten better now that I know my way around a bit more, and the codebase is fully stable, but there is just no excuse for an operating system in this day and age to act like it doesn't have access to memory protection.\n\nThe first thing that bit me was the static memory allocation for the program. Modern operating systems just figure out how much memory you need, but because the mac was originally designed for systems without memory management, significant things have to be laid out ahead of time.\n\nPorting a win32 game to the mac will probably involve more work dealing with memory than any other aspect. Graphics, sound, and networking have reasonable analogues, but you just can't rely on being able to malloc() whatever you want on the mac.\n\nSure, game developers can manage their own memory, but an operating system that has proper virtual memory will let you develop a lot faster.\n\nThe lack of memory protection is the worst aspect of mac development. You can just merrily write all over other programs, the development environment, and the operating system from any application.\n\nI remember that. From dos 3.3 in 1990.\n\nGuard pages will help catch simple overruns, but it won't do anything for all sorts of other problems.\n\nThe second order problem is lack of preemptive multitasking.\n\nThe general responsiveness while working with multiple apps is significantly worse than windows, and you often run into completely modal dialogs that don't let you do anything else at all.\n\nA third order problem is that a lot of the interfaces are fairly clunky.\n\nThere are still many aspects of the mac that clearly show design decisions based on a 128k 68000 based machine. Wintel has grown a lot more than the mac platform did. It may have been because the intel architecture didn't evolve gracefully and that forced the software to reevaluate itself more fully, or it may just be that microsoft pushed harder.\n\nCarbon sanitizes the worst of the crap, but it doesn't turn it into anything particularly good looking.\n\nMacOS X nails all these problems, but thats still a ways away.\n\nI did figure one thing out - I was always a little curious why the early BeOS advocates were so enthusiastic. Coming from a NEXTSTEP background, BeOS looked to me like a fairly interesting little system, but nothing special. To a mac developer, it must have looked like the promised land.."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 917586000, "contents": "The issue of the 8192 unit map dimension limit had been nagging at me for a long time now. The reason for the limit is that coordinates are communicated over the network in 16 bit shorts divided as a sign bit, twelve unit bits, and three fractional bits. There was also another side to the representation problem, but it was rarely visible: if you timescale down, you can actually tell the fractional bit granularity in position and velocity.\n\nThe rest of the system (rendering and gameplay) has never had any issues with larger maps, even in quake 1. There are some single precision floating point issues that begin to creep in if things get really huge, but maps should be able to cover many times the current limit without any other changes.\n\nA while ago I had changed Q3 so that the number of fractional bits was a compile time option, which allowed you to trade off fine grain precision for larger size. I was considering automatically optimizing this for each level based on its size, but it still didn't feel like a great solution.\n\nAnother aspect of the problem that wasn't visible to the public was that the the fractional quantization of position could cause the position to actually be inside a nearby solid when used for client side prediction. The code had to check for this and try to correct the situation by jittering the position in each of the possible directions it might have been truncated from. This is a potential issue whenever there is any loss of precision whatsoever in the server to client communication.\n\nThe obvious solution is to just send the full floating point value for positions, but I resisted that because the majority of our network traffic is positional updates, and I didn't want to bloat it. There have been other bandwidth savings in Q3, and LANs and LPB connections are also relevent, so I was constantly evaluating the tradeoff.\n\nDealing with four or five players in view isn't a real problem. The big bandwidth issues arrive when multiple players start unloading with rapid fire weapons. (as an aside, I tried making 5hz fire weapons for Q3 to save bandwidth, but no matter how much damage they did, 5hz fire rates just seemed to feel slow and weak...)\n\nI finally moved to a bit-level stream encoding to save some more bandwidth and give me some more representational flexibility, and this got me thinking about the characteristics of the data that bother us.\n\nIn general, the floating point coordinates have significant bits all through the mantissa. Any movement along an angle will more or less randomize the low order bits.\n\nMy small little insight was that because missiles are evaluated parameterically instead of itteretively in Q3, a one-time snapping of the coordinates can be performed at their generation time, giving them fixed values with less significant bits for their lifetime without any effort outside their spawning function. It also works for doors and plats, which are also parametrically represented now. Most events will also have integral coordinates.\n\nThe float encoder can check for an integral value in a certain range and send that as a smaller number of bits, say 13 or so. If the value isn't integral, it will be transmitted as a full 32 bit float.\n\nThe other thing I am investigating is sub-byte delta encoding of floating point values. Even with arbitrary precision movement deltas, the sign and exponent bits change with very low frequency except when you are very near the origin. At the minimum, I should be able to cut the standard player coordinate delta reps to three bytes from four.\n\nSo, the bottom line is that the bandwidth won't move much (it might even go down if I cut the integral bits below 15), the maps become unbounded in size to the point of single precision roundoff, and the client doesn't have to care about position jittering (which was visible in Q3 code that will be released)."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 920437200, "contents": "On the issue of railgun firing rates -- we played with it for a while at the slower speed, but it has been put back to exactly Q2's rate of fire.\n\nI do agree with Thresh that the way we had it initially (faster than Q2, but with the same damage) made it an overpowered weapon in the hands of highly skilled players, which is exactly what we should try to avoid.\n\nAn ideal game should give scores as close to directly proportional to the players reletive skills as possible. The better player should win in almost all cases, but the game will be more entertaining if the inferior players are not completely dominated.\n\nQuake 1 had really bad characteristics that way -- Thresh can play extremely talented players and often prevent them from scoring a single point. We wouldn't put up with a conventional sport that commonly game scores of 20 to 1 in championship matches, and I don't think we should encourage it in our games.\n\nEliminating health items is probably the clearest way to prevent blowout games, but that has never been popular. Still, we should try to avoid weapon decisions that allow the hyper-skilled to pull even farther away from the rest of the crowd.

It still hasn't arrived (bad impression), but SGI did bring a loaner system by for us to work with.\n\nThe system tower is better than standard pc fare, but I still think Apple's new G3 has the best designed computer case.\n\nThe wide aspect LCD panel is very nice. A while ago I had been using a dual monitor LCD setup on a previous intergraph, but the analog syncing LCD screens had some fringing problems, and the gamma range was fairly different from a CRT. The SGI display is perfectly crisp (digital interface), and has great color. The lighting is a little bit uneven top to bottom on this unit -- I am interested to see how the next unit looks for comparison.\n\nUnfortunately, the card that they bundle with the LCD if you buy it separately is NOT a good 3D accelerator, so if you care about 3D and want this LCD screen, you need to buy an sgi visual workstation. Several of the next generation consumer cards are going to support digital flat panel outputs, so hopefully soon you will be able to run a TNT2 or something out to one of these.\n\nThe super memory system does not appear to have provided ANY benefit to the CPU. My memory benchmarking tests showed it running about the same as a standard intel design.\n\nOur first graphics testing looked very grim -- Quake3 didn't draw the world at all. I spent a while trying to coax some output by disabling various things, but to no avail. We reported it to SGI, and they got us a fix the next day. Some bug with depthRange(). Even with the fix, 16 bit rendering doesn't seem to work. I expect they will address this.\n\nOther than that, there haven't been any driver anomolies, and both the game and editor run flawlessly.\n\nFor single pass, top quality rendering (32 bit framebuffer, 32 bit depth buffer, 32 bit trilinear textures, high res screen), the SGI has a higher fill rate than any other card we have ever tested on a pc, but not by too wide of a margin.\n\nIf your application can take advantage of multitexture, a TNT or rage128 will deliver slightly greater fill performance. It is likely that the next speed bump of both chips will be just plain faster than the SGI on all fill modes.\n\nA serious flaw is that the LCD display can't support ANY other resolutions except the native 1600*1024. The game chunks along at ten to fifteen fps at that resolution (but it looks cool!). They desperately need to support a pixel doubled 800*512 mode to make any kind of full screen work possible. I expect they will address this.\n\nVsync disable is implemented wrong. Disabling sync causes it to continue rendering, but the flip still doesn't happen until the next frame. This gives repeatable (and faster) benchmark numbers, but with a flashing screen that is unusable. The right way is to just cause the flip to happen on the next scan line, like several consumer cards do, or blit. It gives tearing artifacts, but it is still completely usable, and avoids temporal nyquist issues between 30 and 60 hz. I expect they will address this.\n\nTotal throughput for games is only fair, about like an intergraph. Any of the fast consumer cards will run a quake engine game faster than the sgi in its current form. I'm sure some effort will be made to improve this, but I doubt it will be a serious focus, unless some SGI engineers develop unhealthy quake addictions. :-)\n\nThe unified memory system allows nearly a gig of textures, and individual textures can by up to 4k by 4k. AGP texturing provides some of this benefit for consumer cards, but not to the same degree or level of performance.\n\nThe video stream support looks good, but I haven't tried using it yet.\n\nVery high interpolater accuracy. All the consumer cards start to break up a bit with high magnification, weird aspects, or long edges. The professional cards (intergraph, glint, E&S, SGI) still do a better job.\n\nSGI exports quite a few more useful OpenGL extensions than intergraph does, but multisample antialiasing (as claimed in their literature) doesn't seem to be one of them.\n\nOverall, it looks pretty good, and I am probably going to move over to using the SGI workstation full time when my real system arrives.\n\nI was very happy with the previous two generations of intergraph workstations, but this last batch (GT1) has been a bunch of lemons, and the wildcat graphics has been delayed too long. The current realizm-II systems just don't have enough fill rate for high end development.\n\nFor developers that don't have tons of money, the decision right now is an absolute no-brainer -- buy a TNT and stick it in a cheap system.

Plus a lot of complaining to various apple engineers and executives. :-)\n\nTo be clear:\n\nAt this time, there is no mac that is as fast for gaming (or just about anything, actually) as a pentium III with a top of the line 3D card. Period. I have been misquoted by some mac evangelists as saying otherwise.\n\nThe new (blue and white) G3 systems are very good systems in many ways, and make a perfectly good gaming platform. However, a high end wintel machine just has more horsepower on both the CPU and the 3D card.\n\nA 400 mhz G3 performs about the same as a 400 mhz PII if they aren't fill rate limited, where the faster cards on the PC will give about a 25% advantage. A 500 mhz PIII with an appropriate card in 30% faster than the best mac you can buy.\n\nThe multi colored iMacs, old G3 desktops, and powerbooks can play Quake3, but the RagePro 3D acceleration defines the absolute bottom end of our supported platforms. A serious gamer will not be satisfied with it.\n\nVoodoo cards are not currently supported by the OpenGL driver, which is very unfortunate because many serious mac gamers own voodoo cards. I hope Apple and 3dfx will be able to correct this soon, but I certainly understand Apple's prioritization -- obviously, good support for the OEM video options is of primary importance.\n\nThe voodoo performance will still lag the windows platform by some amount, but some strides have been made in that area recently, so I expect good performance,\n\nGaming is not a reason to buy a mac, but Apple is taking steps so that it may not be a reason to avoid a mac if you have other reasons for wanting one.\n\nMacOS still sucks."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 925012800, "contents": "Some people seem to think that I just make up these performance comparison numbers. I don't. I measure things, and I understand control conditions.\n\nIn this discussion, assume \"wintel\" is a 500 mhz PIII with either a agp rage128, or an agp TNT card, and \"macos\" is a 400 mhz G3 with the pci rage128.\n\nAt the highest level, you can make application class comparisons between platforms. For instance, CodeWarrior on the mac compiles faster than VC++ on wintel, but stuffit is way slower than winzip. This is useful data, but says more about the application design than the relative merits of the platforms. CW uses a single object file repository, for instance.\n\nA better comparison is an identical app on both platforms.\n\nPhotoshop is often faster on macos than wintel. There is certainly a lot of common code, but individual filters are optimized for each platform. Some of these hand optimized operations are significantly faster on the mac.\n\nQuake1 was the counterpoint to that. Quake1 had significant amounts of hand tuned asm code for intel, and the PPC version never got as much attention. The PPC version was noticeably slower (you would have to time at 640*480 to avoid unfairly penalizing the mac for lack of low res modes).\n\nSo, clearly, hand tuned asm code can make either platform pull ahead. It also shows that the two platforms are at least fairly close in performance. I never said macs were SLOW, just not quite as fast as the best intel systems.\n\nQuake3 doesn't software rasterize, so there isn't any great place for lots of asm code (the great place is in the OpenGL driver). The code is essentially identical on all platforms.\n\nQ3 is definitely faster on a wintel system than a macos system. When the wintel version is released, everyone will be independantly repeating that measurement.\n\nEven this measurement isn't exactly an apples to apples comparison, because the OpenGL driver and 3D card are still a significant variance. The two can be broken out farther: Q3 can be run without 3D output to test just the identical compiled code. Wintel is still faster, although somewhat less so. The OpenGL + 3D card setup can be benchmarked separately on the axis of throughput and fill rate, which show the intel system being significantly faster. I can't break that apart into the two separate components, but I will guess that the OpenGL driver is probably as efficient as the wintel drivers and the performance delta is due to the system interface and the video card. The current mac rage128 cards run at 75 mhz, which is a third slower than the PC cards. AGP is also more than just a faster PCI, it can influence the structure of communication with the card.\n\nIt has been my observation in the past that most of my code tracks just about midway between specint and specfp for performance comparisons. There is a lot of floating point, but it is all short vectors, rather than the massive vectors of scientific computing. If we discount the graphics subsystem, Q3 follows this reasonably well. The intel system does slightly better than projected.\n\n\"Sucks\" is a subjective description that can be dismissed as opinion. Note that I have NEVER said that the hardware sucks, or the user interface sucks, just that the mac OPERATING SYSTEM sucks.\n\n\"Faster\", when qualified with testing conditions, is objective, and all the wishing in the world doesn't change it.\n\nObjectivity and quantification are the paths to improvement.\n\nI will be very happy if Apple can produce a desktop system that is faster than anything else you can get. I respect good engineering from any source. Altivec should be better than the PIII extensions (trinary ops -- yeah!). The upcoming system architectures look good. They have a shot at it, but they won't make it if they complacently think \"oh, we are already faster than any pc system\".\n\nMy twin turbo F50 can still be outrun at the dragstrip by much cheaper race cars. Many ferrari owners would not dare set foot at a drag strip, because they fear objective measurements that may not show their important possession in the best light.

If you are getting several red bars visible, you may want to look for a server that drops less packets.\n\nThere are a few tuning variables for people trying to optimize their connection:\n\nThe most important one is \"rate\", which is what the connection speed option in the menu sets.\n\nWe are fairly conservative with the values we set for the given modem speeds: 2500 for 28.8, 3000 for 33, and 3500 for 56k.\n\nYou may actually be connecting faster than that, and modem compression may be buying you something, so you might get a better play experience by increasing the values slightly.\n\nIf you connect at 50000 bps, try a rate of 5000, etc.\n\nI err on the conservative side, because too low of a rate will only make the movement of other things in the world choppy, while too high of a rate can cause huge amounts of lag.\n\nNote that the optimal rate will be somewhat lower than a rate for QW or Q2, because I now include the UDP packet header length in the bandwidth estimate.\n\nYou can ask for a different number of snapshots by changing the \"snaps\" variable, but there isn't a lot of benefit to that. Dedicated servers run at 40hz, so stick to divisors of that: 40, 20 (default), 10. A snaps of 40 will usually just cause you to hit your rate limit a lot faster. It may be usefull for tuning rate, if nothing else.\n\nYou can adjust the local timing point with \"cg_timenudge \", which effectively adds local lag to try to make sure you interpolate instead of extrapolate. If you really want to play on a server that is dropping a ton of packets, a timenudge of 100 or so might make the game smoother.\n\n------ \nOne more addition to net cvars:\n\"cl_maxpackets\" will restrict the maximum number of outgoing packets to prevent client to server rate problems. This does not limit the client framerate. This defaults to 20, which might actually be a bit low. You might try experimenting with raising this to 40.\n\n\"cl_maxfps\" still exists, but it will never need to be used for networking reasons.\n\n\n\n------- \n* converted cvar allocation to indexes to allow range checking\n* cgame converted over to use vmCvar_t instead of cvar_t needed for interpreted cgame\n* fixed server crashing string bug\n* adjusted scoreboard for 8 players\n* show hostname on connection screen\n* fixed null model warning on startup\n* more space for hostname on local servers screen\n* fixed mac Open Transport memory buffer bug, this was causing most of the mac crashes\n* made Info_ValueForKey() case insensitive\n* sv_privateClients, sv_privatePassword. this allows you to reserve slots on a public server for password access while allowing most to be freely available\n* \"server is full\" message on connect screen\n* archive handicap in config file\n* cheat protect r_nocurves\n* byte order independent zip checksum\n* removed cl_stereo, use glConfig.stereoEnabled"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 925185600, "contents": "* cgame converted to use local buffer based lerpTag for interpretation\n* cgame converted to use local buffer based argv for interpretation\n* new sound code to remove latency\n* added drop shadow to field characters and fixed scrolling\n* fixed edge-of-bounce-pad misprediction error (server side)\n* remove broken weapon-stay dmflag\n* made menu gfx never picmip\n* cheat protect r_lightmap\n* clear sound buffer before any file IO\n* use GetOSEvent instead of WaitNextEvent on mac when fullscreen. removes hitches caused by other tasks and gives a performance boost\n* continuous scoreboard / ping update when tab is down\n* put version number on menu background\n* fixed toggle cvar bug\n* dim out behind floating menus"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 925272000, "contents": "* converted sound positioning away from callback method\n* increased mac memory zone by 5 megs\n* new memory allocator for temporary render use during init\n* converted cmodel references to handles and range checked\n* converted sound references to handles and range checked\n* converted file references to handles and range checked"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 925358400, "contents": "* rework versioning for architecture tracking\n* use a seperate endpoint for address resolves on mac\n* hide OTLook warnings if \"developer\" isn't set\n* defered mac renderer scanning until after mode set so 8 bit desktops don't confuse it\n* global motd/update server\n* fixed view model animations on models with custom anims\n\ntechnical note:\n\nQ3 can run networked player movement in either an asynchronous or synchronous manner. The default mode is to allow all client movement to be done asynchronously with the servers advancement of time.\n\nThe primary reason is to allow player movement to be predicted on the client side. The primary drawback is that while your movement is smooth, the other players that you see running around in the world move with a jerkiness that is relative to their framerate and network connection quality. It is NOT necessarily relative to their ping - a player on a fast system with a clean modem connection can move smoothly. If you see a player stuttering around, either they have a bad framerate, or the network connection between them and the server or you and the server is poor. The amount of stuttering is sort of the sum of the dropped or variable packets on BOTH connections.\n\nYou can force Q3 to run all clients synchronously by setting \"g_synchronousClients 1\" on the server. This will make Q3 behave similar to Q1 for networking. All movement will be lagged except view angles, which are still short-circuited immediately.\n\nSome people claim to prefer synchronous movement when everyone had a very good ping, but I don't personally think it is ever a play benefit. It makes leading players a bit easier, but I think the crisp movement control of client side prediction is a much better tradeoff.\n\nHowever, there is still a reason for using it: recorded demos come out a LOT smoother looking when running with sync.

Update releases will lag the official ones, and we won't committ to ANY dates.\n\nI am doing all of my development on intergraph and sgi-NT hardware, but when I have everything rock solid, I will give Nvidia and ATI's NT drivers a try.

This is only a 35% average speedup, but at some times (lots of dynamic lights in complex scenes) the speedup is 90%+. Gameplay is noticably smoother.\n\nThe rendering thread is almost always the blocking factor, so the faster the card and OpenGL driver, the larger the speedup will be.\n\nThis is explicitly a two thread producer / consumer, so there is no benefit to more than two processors. The app is well behaved, using sleeping syncronization so that you usually still have half a processor free for other operating system functions.\n\nHopefully we will be able to test with some fast consumer cards sometime soon.\n\n------\n\nA lot of people asked what was done differently this time vs the last time I tried (without benefit) to use SMP.\n\nMy original attempt was to make a DLL that intercepted all OpenGL calls and let a separate processor execute them. The benefit would have been that all OpenGL applications could have gone faster. The problem was that the bandwidth required to encode all the commands was enough that the processor overhead was as much as it would have taken to just do the geometry on the main processor.\n\nIt would have still been a win if the geometry side was doing lots of work, like multiple lights, user clip planes, and texgens, but for the vast majority of geometry, it didn't balance out. If someone wanted to try that using the PIII or AltiVec streaming memory operations, it could probably still work.\n\nThe current SMP code is implemented directly into the renderer, and a lot of things were moved around and double buffered to allow it to use data in place, instead of having to copy it off.\n\n------\n\nSome people expressed surprise that Quake3 wasn't threaded already.\n\nThreading has been presented so often as the \"high tech\" \"cool\" way to program, that many people aren't aware of the downsides.\n\nA multi-threaded program will always have somewhat lower throughput when running on a single CPU than a single threaded program that polls in explicit places. The cost of a context switch at the cpu level is negligible, but the damage that it can do to the cache hierarchy can add up to a noticeable amount in bad cases.\n\nThe much larger problem is that you lose tight control over when things occur. If the framerates are low enough, it isn't a huge issue, but for applications running at 30+ fps, you really don't want to trust the OS scheduler to coordinate multiple threads and have them all get in every frame. Yes, with explicit sleep() calls you can sort of get it working, but at that point, you might as well not be using threads.\n\nA good example of not-quite-in-sync issues in the windows mouse performance. A PS/2 mouse only samples 40 times a second, so when you get an app updating at around that speed, you will get 0/1/2 scheduling variances.\n\nThey are also not terribly portable, and a pain in the ass to debug."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 927691200, "contents": "* basic joystick controls, some work still needed for advanced controlers\n* r_dlightBacksides 0 option\n* forced cvar_restart when version changes\n* fixed some flare-in-fog problems\n* fixed skin color in menus\n* print obituary message even when you are the killer, so all kills get an entry in the logfile\n* fixed bugs in line token parsing when quotes or commands aren't white space separated\n* multiprocessor acceleration \"r_smp 1\"\n* increase menu dimming\n* increased rocket damage radius from 120 to 150 units\n* check for running server in all server commands (dumpuser, etc)\n* new cvar cheat setup -- by default, only archived variables can be changed when not cheating\n* \"cg_drawstatus 0\" only removes status bar\n* \"cg_draw2d 0\" removes all 2d"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 927777600, "contents": "* enable scissor test properly\n* archive r_lodBias\n* cg_draw3dIcons 0 option\n* data cheating protection\n* userinfo renamed to clientinfo, added state and current server address\n* don't forward commands to a server when playing demos\n* fixed NULL extension on dir command\n* added one more shotgun pellet\n* added CG_Shutdown for cgame cleanup\n* fixed jitter in rising smoke\n* increase minimum time before reusing an entity slot\n* soundinfo reports current background streaming file\n* changed IPX separator to . from :, moved port processing to system independant code\n* auto port scan wasn't updating the net_port cvar\n* attack button presses reset inactivity timer now\n* increased the forced respawn time from 10 to 20 seconds\n* show smp on gfxinfo, slight reformat"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 928036800, "contents": "For the past couple of weeks, I have been spending some development time on linux, and for the first time on a non-NEXTSTEP unix platform, I have actually been enjoying it.\n\nWhile Id has been supporting linux since the Doom days, I have not personally been much of a linux user -- it was always ddt or zoid doing the actual coding and testing. Every year or so I would install a linux distribution and play around with it for a few days, but I would always leave feeling that it was still pretty crude (UI wise) compared to the NEXTSTEP UI I was used to, or even what I had used on other commercial unix workstations and windows.\n\nThere have always been a ton of reasons to like linux, but the user interface was enough of an issue that I couldn't buy into it completely.\n\nThe gnome user environment in Red Hat 6.0 is finally at a level that I consider it a valid alternative to commercial desktop environments. Overall, its still not as smooth, consistant, or complete as windows or the mac, but is does have its strong points, and things seem to be progressing quite rapidly.\n\nIts still not something you would give to a purely casual computer user, but I won't be surprised if even that changes in a couple years.\n\nCodeWarrior for linux is also a significant aspect of my enjoyment. Its a sort of crappy 1.0 port with a lot of little issues, but the editor works well enough, which is the important thing for me.

It doesn't run them FAST, but the quality is good, and I am impressed nonetheless. It is bordering on playable with all quality options set to the minimum on a fast computer, but it still has a ways to go before casual users should take a look at it.\n\nIt is steadily improving, and I hope Matrox will be pleased enough with the progress that they will release the documentation for their setup engine to go with the rasterizer.\n\nIn testing q3 on it, I noticed that with picmip set to 0, textures would get corrupted and it would never settle on a working set. The current Apple OpenGL drivers also have exactly this problem.\n\nThe cool part is that this driver is completely open source. I downloaded the project code, browsed through it a bit, and changed two lines of code to fix the bug. That RULES.\n\nThe next thing is sort of funny. I had been suspecting that a lot of the OpenGL drivers were clearing the entire depth buffer for each of the 3D icons on the status bar, instead of limiting it to the scissor region. I added code to the g200 driver to explicitly crop the clear region in the driver, but it never got executed. A little more investigation showed that I had been making an improper assumption for years -- scissor is not enabled by default. Doh.\n\nEver since noticing that glquake cleared the screen borders when the view is sized down, I had been operating under the assumption that intergraph just had a bug in their drivers. I had double checked that glClear was supposed to be limited to the scissor region, so I thought they were just messing it up.\n\nNow I know that I was just being an idiot about that for the last three years...

Stuff like that.\"\n\nI have the awesome example now: Lighting.\n\nThrough the entire development of Q3, I have been wanting to do dynamic lighting of the world differently. Many of the efficiencies gained by Q3's new map format result in larger and larger lightmaps while it reduces polygon count. That meant that even small dynamic lights may force a lot of work to generate new lighting textures.\n\nI had been wanting to find a way to trade off additional rendering passes for less CPU time.\n\nThis is a perfect example of me outthinking myself.\n\nI knew it would have to be something with projecting a light spot texture onto the world geometry, but I am keenly enough aware of the issues and limitations in projecting a 2D texture onto 3D geometry that my mind kept looking at worst case scenarios -- how do you project a continuous texture onto the inside of a dome with the proper intensities, and some situations with curves. I thought it would require some non-trivial per triangle analysis and operations, when I really just wanted something that could be done on a per-vertex level.\n\nRecently, the 3D texture insight hit me.\n\nCreate a 3D texture of, say, 32*32*32 texels and fill it with your light attenuation function, bright point in the center, fading off to black at the edge. Set it to clamp mode, so any values beyond the edges stay black. Set up a texture coordinate generation matrix to position the light relative to your models. Its a simple translate and scale. Set up lighting calculation to only generate a value based on the relative angles, ignoring attenuation. Use the resulting modulated texture mapping as your \"lightmap\" to modulate another texture pass, or add to a previous lighting pass.\n\nThis has several important benefits:\n\nIt looks good (and identical) on both small and large polygons. Vertex based lighting needs an appalling amount of tessellation to avoid visibly triangulation artifacts. Even if you tessellate to the same sample density as your lightmap grid (hundreds of thousands per map), vertex lighting still looks worse, because it is a triangular instead of bilinear interpolation.\n\nIt can be done completely by upcoming lighting and texgen hardware, but is efficient in software implementations.\n\nIt can be shadowed by either stencil volume shadows or shadow buffer tests.\n\nPost Q3A, I plan on doing a research engine that is fully dynamically lit and shadowed instead of using lightmaps.\n\nOk, but we don't have 3D textures in any hardware now, so this doesn't help me for Q3A.\n\nI continued thinking along complex lines, like \"Any planar slice of a spherical 3D texture will be a 2D circle, and the three triangle points can occupy any location on their respective rings\".\n\nIt still looked like a big mess.\n\nI got tired of thinking about it, and just started coding in some infrastructure to do extra lighting passes. I just made a gradient circle texture for the lighting, and generated the texture coordinates by just translating and scaling X and Y from the world coordinates.\n\nI got it running, grabbed a rocket launcher, and fired down a hallway. It looked just fine. I was stunned. I had been thinking about complex ramifications of weird edge cases for the past year when all it took was a couple hours of programming and the simplest possible approach to make it work decent. Sigh. :-)\n\nThe only real addition required was a fading of the light contribution with Z distance from the surface. The downside to this hack is that while you get a nice ball of light moving over floors and ceilings, you only get a wash of light on walls. In hindsight, I can analyze this in the context of our games and say \"Almost all movement and targeting takes place in the XY plane in a FPS, so accuracy along the Z axis is not necessary.\"\n\nThe somewhat more obvious change to dynamic lighting that wasn't related to the projection issue is that I have it currently set up as a postprocess pass, rather than an additive pass on the lightmap. Adding to the lightmap is more \"right\", but it really complicates the multitexture implementation, and on some surfaces, the lightmap is actually done after the base texture, so it couldn't be added to. The end result is that brighter areas are changed more by dlights than dark areas. I don't feel TOO bad about that, because its not like the dlight is much of a proper lighting simulation even in the best case...\n\n\n\n* fixed tourney restart\n* fixed jittering on plats\n* fixed ref use without a world\n* new default image that lets you see mapping coordinates\n* fixed reliable sequences on restarts and demos\n* allow maxclients to change between levels\n* randomize shell ejection start position and angles\n* display attackers head after every wound\n* added gamma and overbright support to mac version\n* removed table from sound mixing\n* remove smoke and blood puffs when you run through them\n* set cheats to 1 on disconnect\n* shader sort value is now floating point\n* new trajectory type \"TR_INTERPOLATE\", skip interpoaltion for other types\n* fixed door open timing\n* fixed bug with >8 portal areas\n* added area print to r_shwocluster\n* removed all the partial shader match cruft, fixing a crash-on-load\n* fixed bug with personal shadows not being setup properly\n* nomipmap shader parm split and expanded:\nnopicmip : ignores r_picmip so image will always be high res\nnomipmap : forces a single level texture, used for console font\n* shrank sound mixing buffer for better caching\n* new shader option: q3map_lightsubdivide. larger values make q3map -light proceed faster\n* new vertex array interleaving\n* fixed bmodels not counting patches in bounds\n* fixed patch sphere culling on rotating entities\n* cg_simpleItems now draws sprite items\n* fixed serverid being 0 when map is started from cmdline\n* fixed UI on mode changes\n* replaced 1280*960 mode with 1280*1024\n* test all rotated orders for tristrips from faces\n* fixed RB_SurfacePolychain to not duplicate vertexes\n* changed planar face surface type from a convex polygon to a general collection of coplanar triangles\n* change renderer to use bmodel surface list instead of tree\n* changed areabits pointer to areamask array\n* fixed bad loop when client reliable message overflows\n* fixed swapinterval after vid_restart\n* wall mark clipping moved out of cgame, extended for better wrapping over multiple brushes\n* picmip defaults to 1 under all cases now\n* automatic curve LOD grouping\n* duplicated SCR_ functions into cgame\n* implemented Micahel Julier's optimization work\n* implimented Michael Gold's SMP patch\n* new reliable command transport\n* use ENTITYNUM_NONE and ENTITYNUM_WORLD constants, which are now in MAX_GENTITIES range for safe net transport\n* wait for attack released after respawning before firing\n* added a delay before moving everyone to intermission spot\n* fixed bug with regibbing of gibbed body ques\n* blood trails behind gibs\n* changed localents over to trajectories\n* removed world as entity zero, clients are now 0 to MAXCLIENTS-1\n* changed game interface functions to use clientnums instead of pointers\n* removed speculative usercmd_t from user packets\n* new item pickup code, fixed silent item pickup on grazing hits, and expanded the pickup range by 20% without changing the physical bounding box\n* allow a single \"quick jump\" without delay"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 930974400, "contents": "AMD K7 cpus are very fast.\n\nSome timedemo numbers (a new demo, not comparable to previous scores):\n\nRun at 640*480*16 bit color to emphasise the cpu/driver performance rather than the hardware fill rate.\n\n[code]\n                    K7-600  K7-550  PIII-500\nTNT2 ultra 16 bit     73.9    68.5      53.8\nVoodoo3 3000 16 bit    70.5   65.2      46.0\n[/code]\n\nThis is with K7 optimized drivers vs seperate PIII optimized drivers.\n\nThere is still wiggle room there in that it is possible that more effort was expended to make the AMD drivers perform better.

Next time I want to try that, I'll pick some state like Montana... :-)\n\nThe top priority was getting the virtual machine done, but I hoped to also get some more of the map data optimizations completed. I definately underestimated how big of a hole daily meetings would punch in the amount of work I could accomplish.\n\nOn wednesday I was sweating a bit, not sure if I would have the VM finished in time, but it all came together in the last two days.\n\nThe virtual machine interpreter is now completely functional, and cgame can switch between being loaded as a binary .dll or an interpreted .qvm at the change of a cvar.\n\nThe basic setup is that I have a modified version of the lcc compiler that generates assembly files that are processed by a new tool \"q3asm\" into a .qvm file that can be interpreted by q3. You can still use normal dll's for debugging, then release interpreted code. You can release a binary dll if you need some native system services (some networking stuff, for example) or are doing very compute intensive work, but I strongly encourage everyone to try to use the virtual machine.\n\nThe interpreted code has two prime benefits: portability and security.\n\nUser mods done with qvms will automatically work on mac, linux, and any other oddball ports that get released.\n\nA qvm program cannot modify anything outside its private address space, and the \"system calls\" to the game strictly limit what can be touched. I was scared about the binary dll's in Q2, but rationalized it to myself that people running public servers should be aware of the dangers. With Q3 allowing client side programming, it just needs to be safe for everyone.\n\nPackaging is also improved somewhat, because the virtual machine programs can be included in pak files and are automatically handled through the search path.\n\nUnfortunately, even after doing most of the straightforward optimizations, the interpreter is causing a 20% slowdown in timedemos right now.\n\nI am pretty committed to running cgame interpreted, but if I don't get a significant speedup, we may have to leave the server side game module as a native dll. The ui module can obviously be interpreted.\n\nThere are lots of paths I can take to get the performance up:\n\nWrite more efficient cgame code. I will definately be looking at this.

I doubt I will pursue this, unless there are existing optimization projects based on LCC with minimal backend changes required.\n\nImplement more complex interpreted instructions and peephole combine the bytecodes into the new instructions.

I don't want to pursue this until the high level optimizations are wrung out.\n\nLoad time compilation from bytecode to native code. This would bloat a lot, especially on RISC cpus.

I quickly found and fixed a problem with system call return values.\n\nIt was then able to get into the game, but the FOV was clamped out to 160, and it crashed when you fired your gun. That turned out to be my failure to fix the operand stack correctly in the rarely used structure copy opcode.\n\nThe next problem was a little more distressing. You could run around the level, but all the items had an X coordinate of 0. This took a little while to find, and turned out to be a twitchy case of sometimes getting an extra value on the operand stack.\n\nAt that point everything looked like it was working perfectly.

Then I found out that if you play in a level for a few minutes, it either gets an error of some kind, or crashes.\n\nI was quite unhappy about that. Debugging a non-deterministic crash in generated code. Joy.\n\nWhat I wound up eventually doing was to make gigantic log files of all system call interactions and compare the compiled code against identical runs with the interpreter. I had to tweak a few things to make the processing exactly the same between them, but it let me find where things first started to diverge. It turns out I was letting the top of my compiled code's local stack creep down a bit with each call. Let it run long enough, and it started hitting important things. If I had logged stack pointers instead of parameter values, I would have found it a whole lot quicker...\n\nNow, I am pretty confident that it is correct.\n\nThe generated code is pretty grim if you look at it, in part due to the security measures (mask and add for each load/store), and in part due to the fact that it is a straight bytecode translation:\n\n[code]\n06214DD0 83 C7 04             add         edi,4\n06214DD3 C7 07 00 4D 0A 00    mov         dword ptr [edi],0A4D00h\n06214DD9 8B 1F                mov         ebx,dword ptr [edi]\n06214DDB 81 E3 FF FF 1F 00    and         ebx,1FFFFFh\n06214DE1 8B 83 30 00 DC 05    mov         eax,dword ptr [ebx+5DC0030h]\n06214DE7 89 07                mov         dword ptr [edi],eax\n06214DE9 83 C7 04             add         edi,4\n06214DEC C7 07 2C 00 00 00    mov         dword ptr [edi],2Ch\n06214DF2 8B 07                mov         eax,dword ptr [edi]\n06214DF4 01 47 FC             add         dword ptr [edi-4],eax\n06214DF7 83 EF 04             sub         edi,4\n06214DFA 8B 1F                mov         ebx,dword ptr [edi]\n06214DFC 81 E3 FF FF 1F 00    and         ebx,1FFFFFh\n06214E02 8B 83 30 00 DC 05    mov         eax,dword ptr [ebx+5DC0030h]\n06214E08 89 07                mov         dword ptr [edi],eax\n06214E0A 8B 07                mov         eax,dword ptr [edi]\n06214E0C 29 47 FC             sub         dword ptr [edi-4],eax\n06214E0F 83 EF 04             sub         edi,4\n06214E12 83 C7 04             add         edi,4\n06214E15 C7 07 40 00 00 00    mov         dword ptr [edi],40h\n[/code]\n\nCode bulk is also up there, at about 5x the bytecode version. There is definately some savings to be had with better opcode selection, but no more than 30% or so at best.\n\nPerformance is within my tolerance now:\n\nQ3demo1 dll: 52.9\nCompiled: 50.2\nInterpreted: 43.9\n\nQ3demo2 dll: 50.1\nCompiled: 46.5\nInterpreted: 38.7\n\n\nI will probably work a bit more on performance, but that is the ballpark that it will be in. 5% speed hit in most levels, somewhat more in the big open arenas. Next week I will be getting the other modules set up for running in the virtual machine and see how their performance is.\n\nIt is a pretty cool setup - you can have some modules as dlls, some as interpreted bytecodes, and some as compiled bytecodes. We will leave the user interface interpreted to save memory.\n\nTomorrow I am going to get all the byte order issues worked out for powerPC. The interpreter doesn't even work there yet because of inline constant byte order issues. Fixing that will slow the interpreter a little more, but that shouldn't be any problem, with the performance oriented stuff being compiled.\n\nDoing the PPC compiler will be a bit messier because the tools aren't as nice, and the fact that it will involve a whole lot of Mac crash/reboot cycles before it stabilizes, but I think I know what to watch out for now.\n\nVC6 crashed on me about a dozen times in the last few days, probably due to my having show-code-bytes on in the dissassembly window, but it was still pretty damn useful through the whole process.\n\nI am curious to see how the RISC code bulk turns out. The instructions are going to be longer, but all the constants can be held in registers. Should be interesting.\n\nI don't think I am going to be in any hurry to do MIPS/ALPHA/SPARC code generators. One or two code generators and execution environments is educational, but that will be more than enough for me. If we do port to other architectures, they can still run with the interpreter or binary modules until someone else gets up the inclination to do a code generator."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 935640000, "contents": "The current plan is that we will have another test release around the middle of next month. This version will be running game/cgame/ui with the virtual machine, and will include single player play against bots.

Using MSDEV to debug binary dll's does make exploration a lot easier than adding prints to interpreted code...\n\nSome minor porting work on the tools will be necessary to do development under linux.

To be completely clear: you are not legally licensed to create or use addon maps with the test.\n\nI am hoping that this public review will turn up bugs before we complete the game. 50k lines of code is quite a bit to go over, but people familiar with previous games will have a good head start in the game module.\n\nThe best possible situation would be if exploration of the code evolves into a tier system, with either moderated or limited access lists that I can follow without being swamped. I can't afford to be too involved in helping everyone figure out the basics. I have plenty of confidence in the mod communities ability to work that out. :-)\n\n---------\n\nSome people have been mistaking memory swapping in 1.08 for network problems.\n\nWe did controlled, back to back tests against the previous versions, and the networking is identical if you have enough memory.\n\nThe addition of the new character model and all the new menu code and graphics has caused the game to begin to have some swapping problems on 64mb machines if you have all the quality options up high or are running other things.\n\nI am looking into what I can do to reduce memory consumption for the next release, but in the meantime, you can turn down sound quality, geometry, or texture detail to get rid of it.\n\nIf you have less than 64mb, go buy more memory! The final game will have an option to run in less memory, but the graphics and sound quality will be a lot lower.\n\n----------\n\nI made a simple change in the file management that I think is clearly a big win.\n\nInstead of scanning for pak0.pk3, pak1.pk3, ... pak9.pk3 in game directories, I now scan the entire directory for all .pk3 files, and add them to the search path in alphabetical order.\n\nThis gives us the same needed functionality we have now -- overriding things in pak0.pk3 with updated data in pak1.pk3, but it also gives a signficant benefit to the user community.\n\nThere has been a lot of requests to have textures inside maps like Quake1 did, but I was not willing to do that. Having the files separate saves an immense amount of duplication, and keeps the internal architecture uniform.\n\nNow, you can just add all your new art into a pk3 (zip) file along with your map and users can just drop that single file into their quake3/baseq3 directory as a single operation.\n\nThis will also be nice for custom models, which require several component parts: legs, torso, head, animations, levels of detail, and skins.\n\nSo, if you are strictly ADDING media (models, textures, maps, etc), then you can just drop the pk3 files in the normal directory.\n\nIf you are REPLACING data (code modules, menus, etc), you should make a new game directory and put the pk3 there. Starting up with \"quake3 +set game mygame\" will make all the mygame pk3 files override anything in baseq3. You could do it by just naming your pk3 file \"zzzstuff.pk3\", but then you wouldn't have a way to run the game without the addons.\n\nA prudent person might choose to put ALL addons into a separate directory and leave baseq3 pristine for official additions.\n\n----------\n\nOther stuff that has been done lately:\n\n* don't clamp dedicated server or client times until much later -- prevents time resets under ordinary conditions\n* fixed CG_ProcessSnapshots: cg.snap->serverTime\n* only drift time on receipt of packets with a steady ping -- improve catchup after drops\n* fixed players getting stuck together\n* new pak file support\n* derez mac resource file\n* intro/loop option for music files\n* fixed lerp-through-world when changing teams\n* show ping and netgraph for spectators\n* fixed timescale off by one problem\n* tracked down player count wrong on server list\n* info_spectator_start entity\n* shader language change: clampTexCoord removed, added clampmap\n* r_debugSort cvar for working on transparency sorting problems\n* changed minimum cl_maxpackets to 15\n* fixed can't-respawn-when-someone-is-on-your-body\n* fixed dlighting over alpha tested surfaces\n* z_stats lists all blocks >= given size\n* fixed wasted model slots\n* increased com_hunkmegs\n* com_buildScript cvar to force loading all media and quit on errors\n* fixed bad playerstate interpolation across teleporters\n* converted local sounds to sfxHandle_t\n* new fog code doesn't require subdivisions\n* fixed sun positioning problem\n* added fogging of triangle objects\n* fixed devmap issue\n* make g_log a filename instead of a 0/1\n* g_logsync option to force a flush after each write must be set at time of log file creation"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 935812800, "contents": "* spinning machinegun barrel\n* changed q3data -origin option to -offset, defaulted to 0 0 24 for all player grabs\n* removed second parm from -lod in q3data\n* fixed 0 ping on last player killed before fraglimit\n* better ping calculation right after transitions\n* add time back to scoreboard\n* sv_maxRate option to force all clients to play with a max rate.

There are two types of paging that occur:\n\nOne time only paging that eventually settles down after you have run around the entire level a few times. This can be a result of having lots of data around that isn't actively used during the game, or was only used at startup.\n\nTrue capacity misses, where the game is actually touching more memory during play than you have available. This is usually due to there just being too many textures and models.\n\nLoading a large map with full resolution, 32 bit textures and mipmaps consumes almost 40 megs of texture space. The default of picmip 1 and 16 bit textures reduces that to six or seven (not all images observe picmip) in theory, but some OpenGL implementations keep a 32 bit version of the texture around even if the card only uses 16 bit (I consider this inapropriate), so it may still be twelve or more megs just for the images.\n\nI have been able to save a couple megs off of the true capacity requirements by not rolling through some larger buffers when not needed (not smp and not dedicated server), and several megs more of one-time data mostly by moving a lot of static tables to dynamic allocation.\n\nI can probably save another meg of true capacity and I think three or four megs of initialization data. The big thing that I might be forced to do is go to a skeletal animation system. I would hate to do that at this late a point in the project, but it would save about two megs per player model in the game.\n\nIn the process of chasing down the static memory hogs, I finally got around to starting something I have needed to do for years: learn perl.\n\nI was scanning through a linker map file looking for large gaps in addresses, thinking to myself \"this is one of those things you can probably do in three lines of perl code\".

There will be some speedup in the normal C code from the faster floating point unit, and the Apple OpenGL has AltiVec optimizations, so framerates will improve somewhat.

Can you explain what some of the\n>major things that should be rendered using a display list are? I see\n>the importance of using them for characters (animation) and objects, but\n>what about using them for the rest of the world, particles, and other\n>things that are nifty.\n\nThis is not yet a big issue, although even pure software OpenGL's could perform some optimizations with display lists that aren't possible with vertex arrays. With hardware geometry acceleration, it can be an honest 4x improvement in throughput.\n\nThe important point is that once geometry acceleration becomes a primary target, practically everything will have to be rendered with display lists, or you will run into a nasty case of Amdahl's law.\n\nIn a busy Q3 battle, the triangle count may be split roughly evenly between character models and world geometry. Going from an empty scene to a pitched battle can result in a 50% performance drop if you are triangle limited. Not great, but livable.\n\nIf we kept the same ratios and designed for geometry acceleration with all the static world geometry in display lists, then the empty scene could have 4x the geometry and still be running the same speed. However, current OpenGL display lists can't really accelerate high quality skinned characters, so when an equal number of character polygons was in scene and passed through normal direct rendering, the performance would drop to 20% of the original. Unacceptable.\n\nSo, either you would have to use significantly different polygon counts in characters and the world, or some new API features would need to be defined. Nvidia has a skinning extension that gives some benefit, but still requires a character to be broken up into one static list per bone pair, instead of a single list for the entire character.\n\nRendering a few thousand particles or other procedurally generated triangles directly isn't going to be a big issue, but the bulk of the work is going to move towards static vertex data.\n\nMy advice for display lists is to use them for just raw vertex/color/texcoord data, and keep your state changes done with direct commands. This allows you to still sort display lists to minimze state changes, and prevents drivers from ever having to check state internally. Some hardware architectures can nicely encapsulate all state changes in a single dma buffer, but register sharing among different fields sometimes requires the driver to do manual masks, negating much of the async display list benefits. Texture swapping also complicates state changes inside display lists.\n\nYou want to make the display lists as big as practical, but there is a tradeoff betwen culling tightness and display list size."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 938750400, "contents": "* 10 crosshairs to select from (cg_drawCrosshair 1 - 10)\n* cg_crosshairx / cg_crosshairy adjustment.

It is sort of neat (I need to go buy an AirPort, then it will definately be neat), but it is currently way too slow to play Q3 on.\n\nApple's high end G3 and G4 systems with rage128/rage128pro cards and latest drivers are just about as fast as equivelant wintel systems, but the rest of the product line is still suffering a noticable speed disadvantage.\n\nThe new iMac has a rage128, but it is only an 8mb/64bit version. Still, with agp texturing it is a solid platform with performance that is certainly good enough to play the game well on.\n\nExisting iMacs have 6mb ragePro video. ATI's windows drivers for the pro have come a long ways, and Q3 is plenty playbale on windows with a rage pro (ugly, but playable). On apple systems (iMacs and beige G3's), the performance is sometimes as low as HALF the windows platform. The lack of AGP contributes some to this, but it is mostly just a case of the drivers not being optimzed yet. The focus has been on the rage128 so far.\n\nThe iBook is also ragePro based, but it is an ultra-cheap 32 bit version. It does texture over AGP, but it is slooooow. I suspect it is still driver issues, because it is still very slow even at 320x240, so that leaves hope that it can be improved.\n\nAnother issue with the Apple systems is that Apple 16 bit color is actually 15 bit. I never used to think it made much difference, but I have been doing a lot of side by side comparying, and it does turn out to be a noticable loss of quality.\n\n* new lg splash\n* added channel number for local sounds so feedbacks don't override announcers\n* removed scoreup feedback sound\n* expand score tabs as needed for large scores\n* fixed bfg obit\n* fixed swimming off floors\n* fixed swim animation when jumping in shallow water\n* fixed first weapopn switch problem\n* convert all joystick axis to button events (twist is now bindable)"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 940651200, "contents": "An announcement:\n\nWe have hired Robert Duffy as a full time employee, starting in December.\n\nHe has been maintaining the level editor since the release of Q2, but a number of things have convinced me it is time to have a full time tool-guy at id.\n\nThe original QE4 editor was my very first ever Win32 program, and while Robert has done a good job of keeping it on life support through necessary extensions and evolutions, it really is past its designated lifespan.\n\nI want to take a shot at making the level editor cross platform, so it can be used on linux and mac systems.

We felt that that 50% increase on those polygons was justified in normal play, but as people have pointed out, when you are playing with vertex lighting, that three passes stays three passes instead of collapsing to a single pass, resulting in a 300% increase on those polygons over the way it was before. Still faster than lightmap mode, but a large variance over other parts of the level.\n\nToday I wrote new code to address that, and improve on top of it.\n\nNow when r_vertexlight is on, I force every single shader to a single pass. In the cases where it isn't a simple light*texture case, I try and intelligently pick the most representative pass and do some fixups on the shader modulations.\n\nThis works our great, and brings the graphics load down to the minimum we can do with the data sets.\n\nPerformance is still going to be down a couple msec a frame due to using dynamic compilation instead of dll's for the cgame, but that is an intentional tradeoff. You can obviously slow things down by running a lot of bots, but that is to be expected.\n\nI am still investigating the high idle dedicated server cpu utilization and a few other issues.

This prevents excessive flooding by chats, model / name changes, and any other command that could possibly be exploited. The command streams are stalled, so it doesn't have any effect on processing order or reliability.\n\nThis means that if you issue two commands immediately after one another, there will be a one second stall before the second command and all movement clears. You see this on the lagometer as yellow spiking up for a second, then dropping away.\n\nHitting tab for the scoreboard sends a command, so you trigger the flood protection if you bang tab a couple times. This has been fixed so that the scoreboard will never send more than one update request every two seconds, but you will need to watch out for it in the existing demo.\n\nThe defered model loading has also caused some confusion, but that is a feature, not a bug. :)\n\nIn previous tests, you hitched for a second or two whenever a client with a new model or skin joined a game.\n\nIn the demo, when a client joins the game they will be given the model and skin of someone else temporarily, so there is no hitch. The only time it will hitch on entry is if it is a team game and there isn't anyone on the team they join. I make sure the skin color is correct, even if the model isn't.\n\nThese \"defered\" clients will be loaded when you bring up the scoreboard. You can do this directly by hitting tab, or you can have it happen for you when you die.\n\nThe point is: you died BEFORE it hitched, not as a result of the hitch.\n\nThe scoreboard header is up, but it is still a bit easy to miss.\n\n* fixed high server idle cpu usage (it was spinning in place until maxfps was used!)\n* fixed g_password, which is crashing in the demo\n* moved svs.snapshotEntities to the hunk\n* enable lagometer whenever running a non-local game\n* cg_drawTeamOverlay cvar, set to 0 by default\n* finished authorize work\n* better reporting of unused highwater memory"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 942901200, "contents": "The mac version is out.

Because the developers (me included) are basically just doing the work in their spare time, testing usually only consists of running their favorite OpenGL application, and a few of the mesa demos, or some of the xscreensaver hacks.\n\nRecently I did the initial bringup of a RagePro driver on linux, and I was much more conscious of the large untested feature space, and the tunnel vision I was using to get it to the point of running Q3.\n\nWhat we need is someone, or a group of someones, who can really exercise different implementations through all corners of the OpenGL specification and provide detailed lists of faults with minimal test cases to reproduce the behavior.\n\nIn most cases, the bugs could then be fixed, but even if it is decided that the incorrect behavior is going to stay (to avoid a software fallback in a common accelerated case), there would be clear documentation of it.\n\nI consider performance on the matrox driver right now to be \"good enough\". There is definately more performance oriented work going on, but given a choice of tasks to work on, I would rather improve quality and coverage instead of kicking a few more fps out of Q3.\n\nOne of Alex St. John's valid points was that \"The drivers are always broken\". There are a lot of factors that contribute to it, including fierce benchmarking competition causing driver writers to do some debatable things and diminish focus on quality. With open source drivers, some of those factors go away. Sure, it is nice to beat windows drivers on some benchmarks, but I wouldn't let pursuit of that goal introduce dumb things into the code.\n\nSome of the windows IHVs have good testing proceedures and high quality drivers, but even there, it would be nice to have someone hounding them about things beyond how well quake releated games run.\n\nThe same goes for Apple, especially now that there is both ATI and 3dfx support.\n\nConformance would be my primary interest, but characterizing the performance of different drivers would also be usefull, especially for edge cases that may or may not be accelerated, like glDrawPixels.\n\nOn linux right now, we have:\n\nThe traditional fullscreen 3dfx mesa driver \nThe DRI-GLX based banshee/voodoo3 driver \nThe utah-GLX matrox G200/G400 driver \nThe temporary utah-GLX nvidia driver \nThe newly born utah-GLX ATI Rage Pro driver\n\nIf anyone is interested, join the developer list off of: http://glx.on.openprojects.net/\n\nDoing a proper job would require a really good knowledge of the OpenGL specification, and a meticulous style, but it wouldn't require hardcore registers-and-dma driver writing skills, only basic glut programming.\n\nIf someone does wind up developing a good suite of tools and procedures and gives one of the drivers a really good set of feedback, I would be happy to provide extra video cards so they could beat up all the implementations."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 945234000, "contents": "Anna Kang left Id a couple weeks ago to found her own company - Fountainhead Entertainment.\n\nIt wasn't generally discussed during her time at Id, but we had been going out when she joined the company, and we were engaged earlier this year.

Because of the way quake mods work, It has always been possible to have server side cheats along the lines of \"if name == mine, scale damage by 75%\". You have to trust the server operator.\n\nSo, the problem then becomes a matter of making sure the clients are all playing with an acceptable version before allowing them to connect to the server. You obviously can't just ask the client, because if it is hacked it can just tell you what you want to hear. Because of the nature of the GPL, you can't just have a hidden part of the code to do verification.\n\nWhat needs to be done is to create two closed source programs that act as executable loaders / verifiers and communication proxies for the client and server. These would need to be produced for each platform the game runs on. Some modifications will need to be done to the open source code to allow it to (optionally) communicate with these proxies.\n\nThese programs would perform a robust binary digest of the programs they are loading and communicate with their peer in a complex encrypted protocol before allowing the game connection to start. It may be possible to bypass the proxy for normal packets to avoid adding any scheduling or latency issues, but it will need to be involved to some degree to prevent a cheater from hijacking the connection once it is created.\n\nThe server operator would determine which versions of the game are to be allowed to connect to their server if they wish to enforce proxy protection. The part of the community that wants to be competetive will have to agree to some reasonable schedule of adoption of new versions.\n\nNothing in online games is cheat-proof (there is allways the device driver level of things to hack on), but that would actually be more secure than the game as it originally shipped, because hex edited patches wouldn't work any more. Someone could still in theory hack the closed source programs, but that is the same situation everyone was in with the original game.\n\nPeople can start working on this immediately. There is some prior art in various unix games that would probably be helpfull.

Because of the wau quake\nmods work, It has always been possible to have server side cheats\nalong the lines of \"if name == mine, scale damage by 75%\".  You have\nto trust the server operator.\n\nSo, the problem then becomes a matter of making sure the clients are\nall playing with an acceptable version before allowing them to connect\nto the server.  You obviously can't just ask the client, because if it\nis hacked it can just tell you what you want to hear.  Because of the\nnature of the GPL, you can't just have a hidden part of the code to do\nverification.\n\nWhat needs to be done is to create two closed source programs that act\nas executable loaders / verifiers and communication proxies for the\nclient and server.  These would need to be produced for each platform\nthe game runs on.  Some modifications will need to be done to the\nopen source code to allow it to (optionally) communicate with these\nproxies.\n\nThese programs would perform a robust binary digest of the programs they\nare loading and communicate with their peer in a complex encrypted\nprotocol before allowing the game connection to start.  It may be\npossible to bypass the proxy for normal packets to avoid adding any\nscheduling or latency issues, but it will need to be involved to some\ndegree to prevent a cheater from hijacking the connection once it is\ncreated.\n\nThe server operator would determine which versions of the game are to\nbe allowed to connect to their server if they wish to enforce proxy\nprotection.  The part of the community that wants to be competetive\nwill have to agree to some reasonable schedule of adoption of new\nversions.\n\nNothing in online games is cheat-proof (there is allways the device\ndriver level of things to hack on), but that would actually be more\nsecure than the game as it originally shipped, because hex edited patches\nwouldn't work any more.  Someone could still in theory hack the closed\nsource programs, but that is the same situation everyone was in with\nthe original game.\n\nPeople can start working on this immediately.  There is some prior art\nin various unix games that would probably be helpfull.  It would also\nbe a good idea to find some crypto hackers to review proposed proxy\ncommunication strategies.\n\n\n12/21/99\n--------\n\nThe Q3 game source code is getting pushed back a bit because we had to do\nsome rearranging in the current codebase to facilitate the release, and\nwe don't want to release in-progress code before the official binary point\nrelease.\n\nWe still have a Christmas present for the coders, though:\n\nhttp://www.idsoftware.com/q1source/\n\nHappy holidays!\n\n"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 946530000, "contents": "Several people have mentioned an existing anti-cheat QW proxy that should also be applicable to modified versions:\n\nhttp://www.students.tut.fi/~zibbo/qizmo/"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 951282000, "contents": "This is a public statement that is also being sent directly to Slade at QuakeLives regarding http://www.quakelives.com/main/ql.cgi?section=dlagreement&file=qwcl-win32/\n\nI see both sides of this.

When anisotropic viewing angles and upper level clamping are taken into account, the number gets smaller. Take 1/3 as a conservative estimate.\n\nGiven a fairly aggressive six texture passes over the entire screen, that equates to needing twice as many texels as pixels. At 1024x768 resolution, well under two million texels will be referenced, no matter what the finest level of detail is. This is the worst case, assuming completely unique texturing with no repeating. More commonly, less than one million texels are actually needed.\n\nAs anyone who has tried to run certain Quake 3 levels in high quality texture mode on an eight or sixteen meg card knows, it doesn't work out that way in practice. There is a fixable part and some more fundamental parts to the fall-over-dead-with-too-many-textures problem.\n\nThe fixable part is that almost all drivers perform pure LRU (least recently used) memory management. This works correctly as long as the total amount of textures needed for a given frame fits in the card's memory after they have been loaded. As soon as you need a tiny bit more memory than fits on the card, you fall off of a performance cliff. If you need 14 megs of textures to render a frame, and your graphics card has 12 megs available after its frame buffers, you wind up loading 14 megs of texture data over the bus every frame, instead of just the 2 megs that don't fit. Having the cpu generate 14 megs of command traffic can drop you way into the single digit frame rates on most drivers.\n\nIf an application makes reasonable effort to group rendering by texture, and there is some degree of coherence in the order of texture references between frames, much better performance can be gotten with a swapping algorithm that changes its behavior instead of going into a full thrash:\n\n[code]\nWhile ( memory allocation for new texture fails ) \n    Find the least recently used texture.\n    If the LRU texture was not needed in the previous frame,\n        Free it\n    Else\n        Free the most recently used texture that isn't bound to an active texture unit\n[/code]\n\nFreeing the MRU texture seems counterintuitive, but what it does is cause the driver to use the last bit of memory as a sort of scratchpad that gets constantly overwritten when there isn't enough space. Pure LRU plows over all the other textures that are very likely going to be needed at the beginning of the next frame, which will then plow over all the textures that were loaded on top of them.\n\nIf an application uses textures in a completely random order, any given replacement policy has the some effect..\n\nTexture priority for swapping is a non-feature. There is NO benefit to attempting to statically prioritize textures for swapping. Either a texture is going to be referenced in the next frame, or it isn't. There aren't any useful gradations in between. The only hint that would be useful would be a notice that a given texture is not going to be in the next frame, and that just doesn't come up very often or cover very many texels.\n\nWith the MRU-on-thrash texture swapping policy, things degrade gracefully as the total amount of textures increase but due to several issues, the total amount of textures calculated and swapped is far larger than the actual amount of texels referenced to draw pixels.\n\nThe primary problem is that textures are loaded as a complete unit, from the smallest mip map level all the way up to potentially a 2048 by 2048 top level image. Even if you are only seeing 16 pixels of it off in the distance, the entire 12 meg stack might need to be loaded.\n\nPacking can also cause some amount of wasted texture memory. When you want to load a two meg texture, it is likely going to require a lot more than just two megs of free texture memory, because a lot of it is going to be scattered around in 8k to 64k blocks. At the pathological limit, this can waste half your texture memory, but more reasonably it is only going to be 10% or so, and cause a few extra texture swap outs.\n\nOn a frame at a time basis, there are often significant amounts of texels even in referenced mip levels that are not seen. The back sides of characters, and large textures on floors can often have less than 50% of their texels used during a frame. This is only an issue as they are being swapped in, because they will very likely be needed within the next few frames. The result is one big hitch instead of a steady loading.\n\nThere are schemes that can help with these problems, but they have costs.\n\nPacking losses can be addressed with compaction, but that has rarely proven to be worthwhile in the history of memory management. A 128-bit graphics accelerator could compact and sort 10 megs of texture memory in about 10 msec if desired.\n\nThe problems with large textures can be solved by just not using large textures. Both packing losses, and non- referenced texels can be reduced by chopping everything up into 64x64 or 128x128 textures. This requires preprocessing, adds geometry, and requires messy overlap of the textures to avoid seaming problems.\n\nIt is possible to estimate which mip levels will actually be needed and only swap those in. An application can't calculate exactly the mip map levels that will be referenced by the hardware, because there are slight variations between chips and the slope calculation would add significant processing overhead. A conservative upper bound can be taken by looking at the minimum normal distance of any vertex referencing a given texture in a frame. This will overestimate the required textures by 2x or so and still leave a big hit when the top mip level loads for big textures, but it can allow giant cathedral style scenes to render without swapping.\n\nClever programmers can always work harder to overcome obstacles, but in this case, there is a clear hardware solution that gives better performance than anything possible with software and just makes everyone's lives easier: virtualize the card's view of its local memory.\n\nWith page tables, address fragmentation isn't an issue, and with the graphics rasterizer only causing a page load when something from that exact 4k block is needed, the mip level problems and hidden texture problems just go away. Nothing sneaky has to be done by the application or driver, you just manage page indexes.\n\nThe hardware requirements are not very heavy. You need translation lookaside buffers (TLB) on the graphics chip, the ability to automatically load the TLB from a page table set up in local memory, and the ability to move a page from AGP or PCI into graphics memory and update the page tables and reference counts. You don't even need that many TLB, because graphics access patterns don't hop all over the place like CPU access can. Even with only a single TLB for each texture bilerp unit, reloads would only account for about 1/32 of the memory access if the textures were 4k blocked. All you would really want at the upper limit would be enough TLB for each texture unit to cover the texels referenced on a typical rasterization scan line.\n\nSome programmers will say \"I don't want the system to manage the textures, I want full control!\" There are a couple responses to that. First, a page level management scheme has flexibility that you just can't get with a software only scheme, so it is a set of brand new capabilities. Second, you can still just choose to treat it as a fixed size texture buffer and manage everything yourself with updates. Third, even if it WAS slower than the craftiest possible software scheme (and I seriously doubt it), so much of development is about willingly trading theoretical efficiency for quicker, more robust development. We don't code overlays in assembly language any more..\n\nSome hardware designers will say something along the lines of \"But the graphics engine goes idle when you are pulling the page over from AGP!\" Sure, you are always better off to just have enough texture memory and never swap, and this feature wouldn't let you claim any more megapixels or megatris, but every card winds up not having enough memory at some point. Ignoring those real world cases isn't helping your customers. In any case, it goes idle a hell of a lot less than if you were loading the entire texture over the command fifo.\n\n3Dlabs is supposed to have some form of virtual memory management in the permedia 3, but I am not familiar with the details (if anyone from 3dlabs wants to send me the latest register specs, I would appreciate it!).\n\nA mouse controlled first person shooter is fairly unique in how quickly it can change the texture composition of a scene. A 180-degree snap turn can conceivably bring in a completely different set of textures on a subsequent frame. Almost all other graphics applications bring textures in at a much steadier pace.\n\nSo, given that 180-degree snap turn to a completely different and uniquely textured scene, what would be the worst case performance? An AGP 2x bus is theoretically supposed to have over 500 mb/sec of bandwidth. It doesn't get that high in practice, but linear 4k block reads would give it the best possible conditions, and even at 300 mb/sec, reloading the entire texture working set would only take 10 msec.\n\nRendering is not likely to be buffered sufficiently to overlap appreciably with page loading, and the command transport for a complex scene will take significant time by itself, so it shows that a worst case scene will often not be able to be rendered in 1/60th of a second.\n\nThis is roughly the same lower bound that you get from a chip texturing directly from AGP memory. A direct AGP texture gains the benefit of fine-grained rendering overlap, but loses the benefit of subsequent references being in faster memory (outside of small on-chip caches). A direct AGP texture engine doesn't have the higher upper bounds of a cached texture engine, though. It's best and worst case are similar (generally a good thing), but the cached system can bring several times more bandwidth to bear when it isn't forced to swap anything in.\n\nThe important point is that the lower performance bound is almost an order of magnitude faster than swapping in the textures as a unit by the driver.\n\nIf you just positively couldn't deal with the chance of that much worst case delay, some form of mip level biasing could be made to kick in, or you could try and do pre-touching, but I don't think it would ever be worth it. The worst imaginable case is acceptable, and you just won't hit that case very often.\n\nUnless a truly large number of TLB are provided, the textures would need to be blocked. The reason is that with a linear texture, a 4k page maps to only a couple scan lines on very large textures. If you are going with the grain you get great reuse, but if you go across it, you wind up referencing a new page every couple texel accesses. What is wanted is an addressing mechanism that converts a 4k page into a square area in the texture, so the page access is roughly constant for all orientations. There is also a benefit from having a 128 bit access also map to a square block of pixels, which several existing cards already do. The same interleaving-of-low-order-bits approach can just be extended a few more bits.\n\nDealing with blocked texture patterns is a hassle for a driver writer, but most graphics chips have a host blit capability that should let the chip deal with changing a linear blit into blocked writes. Application developers should never know about it, in any case.\n\nThere are some other interesting things that could be done if the page tables could trigger a cpu interrupt in addition to being automatically backed by AGP or PCI memory. Textures could be paged in directly from disk for truly huge settings, or decompressed from jpeg blocks, or even procedurally generated. Even the size limits of the AGP aperture could usefully be avoided if the driver wanted to manage each page's allocation.\n\nAside from all the basic swapping issue, there are a couple of other hardware trends that push things this way.\n\nEmbedded dram should be a driving force. It is possible to put several megs of extremely high bandwidth dram on a chip or die with a video controller, but won't be possible (for a while) to cram a 64 meg geforce in. With virtualized texturing, the major pressure on memory is drastically reduced. Even an 8mb card would be sufficient for 16 bit 1024x768 or 32 bit 800x600 gaming, no matter what the texture load.\n\nThe only thing that prevents a geometry processor based card from turning almost any set of commands in a display list into a single static dma buffer is the fact that textures may be swapped in and out, causing the register programming in the buffer to be wrong. With virtual texture addressing, a texture's address never changes, and an arbitrarily complex model can be described in a static dma buffer."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 954129600, "contents": "Seumas McNally\n\nTwo years ago, Id was contacted by the Startlight Foundation, an organization that tries to grant wishes to seriously ill kids.

(Basically I just put in enough minus signs after the fact to make it work.)

These lines are lines that pass exactly through the eyepoint. After which you are dead and don't care about divide-by-zero errors.\n\nIf you laughed, you are a graphics geek.\n\nMy first recollection of a Jim Blinn article many years ago was my skimming over it and thinking \"My god, what ridiculously picky minutia.\" Over the last couple years, I found myself haranguing people over some fairly picky issues, like the LSB errors with cpu vs rasterizer face culling and screen edge clipping with guard band bit tests. After one of those pitches, I quite distinctly thought to myself \"My god, I'm turning into Jim Blinn!\" :)"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 956980800, "contents": "We need more bits per color component in our 3D accelerators.\n\nI have been pushing for a couple more bits of range for several years now, but I now extend that to wanting full 16 bit floating point colors throughout the graphics pipeline. A sign bit, ten bits of mantissa, and five bits of exponent (possibly trading a bit or two between the mantissa and exponent). Even that isn't all you could want, but it is the rational step.\n\nIt is turning out that I need a destination alpha channel for a lot of the new rendering algorithms, so intermediate solutions like 10/12/10 RGB formats aren't a good idea. Higher internal precision with dithering to 32 bit pixels would have some benefit, but dithered intermediate results can easily start piling up the errors when passed over many times, as we have seen with 5/6/5 rendering.\n\nEight bits of precision isn't enough even for full range static image display. Images with a wide range usually come out fine, but restricted range images can easily show banding on a 24-bit display. Digital television specifies 10 bits of precision, and many printing operations are performed with 12 bits of precision.\n\nThe situation becomes much worse when you consider the losses after multiple operations. As a trivial case, consider having multiple lights on a wall, with their contribution to a pixel determined by a texture lookup. A single light will fall off towards 0 some distance away, and if it covers a large area, it will have visible bands as the light adds one unit, two units, etc. Each additional light from the same relative distance stacks its contribution on top of the earlier ones, which magnifies the amount of the step between bands: instead of going 0,1,2, it goes 0,2,4, etc. Pile a few lights up like this and look towards the dimmer area of the falloff, and you can believe you are back in 256-color land.\n\nThere are other more subtle issues, like the loss of potential result values from repeated squarings of input values, and clamping issues when you sum up multiple incident lights before modulating down by a material.\n\nRange is even more clear cut. There are some values that have intrinsic ranges of 0.0 to 1.0, like factors of reflection and filtering. Normalized vectors have a range of -1.0 to 1.0. However, the most central quantity in rendering, light, is completely unbounded. We want a LOT more than a 0.0 to 1.0 range. Q3 hacks the gamma tables to sacrifice a bit of precision to get a 0.0 to 2.0 range, but I wanted more than that for even primitive rendering techniques. To accurately model the full human sensable range of light values, you would need more than even a five bit exponent.\n\nThis wasn't much of an issue even a year ago, when we were happy to just cover the screen a couple times at a high framerate, but realtime graphics is moving away from just \"putting up wallpaper\" to calculating complex illumination equations at each pixel. It is not at all unreasonable to consider having twenty textures contribute to the final value of a pixel. Range and precision matter.\n\nA few common responses to this pitch:\n\n\"64 bits per pixel??? Are you crazy???\" Remember, it is exactly the same relative step as we made from 16 bit to 32 bit, which didn't take all that long.\n\nYes, it will be slower. That's ok. This is an important point: we can't continue to usefully use vastly greater fill rate without an increase in precision. You can always crank the resolution and multisample anti-alaising up higher, but that starts to have diminishing returns well before you use of the couple gigatexels of fill rate we are expected to have next year. The cool and interesting things to do with all that fill rate involves many passes composited into less pixels, making precision important.\n\n\"Can we just put it in the texture combiners and leave the framebuffer at 32 bits?\" No. There are always going to be shade trees that overflow a given number of texture units, and they are going to be the ones that need the extra precision. Scales and biases between the framebuffer and the higher precision internal calculations can get you some mileage (assuming you can bring the blend color into your combiners, which current cards can't), but its still not what you want. There are also passes which fundamentally aren't part of a single surface, but still combine to the same pixels, as with all forms of translucency, and many atmospheric effects.\n\n\"Do we need it in textures as well?\" Not for most image textures, but it still needs to be supported for textures that are used as function look up tables.\n\n\"Do we need it in the front buffer?\" Probably not. Going to a 64 bit front buffer would probably play hell with all sorts of other parts of the system. It is probably reasonable to stay with 32 bit front buffers with a blit from the 64 bit back buffer performing a lookup or scale and bias operation before dithering down to 32 bit. Dynamic light adaptation can also be done during this copy. Dithering can work quite well as long as you are only performing a single pass.\n\nI used to be pitching this in an abstract \"you probably should be doing this\" form, but two significant things have happened that have moved this up my hit list to something that I am fairly positive about.\n\nMark Peercy of SGI has shown, quite surprisingly, that all Renderman surface shaders can be decomposed into multi-pass graphics operations if two extensions are provided over basic OpenGL: the existing pixel texture extension, which allows dependent texture lookups (matrox already supports a form of this, and most vendors will over the next year), and signed, floating point colors through the graphics pipeline. It also makes heavy use of the existing, but rarely optimized, copyTexSubImage2D functionality for temporaries.\n\nThis is a truly striking result. In retrospect, it seems obvious that with adds, multiplies, table lookups, and stencil tests that you can perform any computation, but most people were working under the assumption that there were fundamentally different limitations for \"realtime\" renderers vs offline renderers. It may take hundreds or thousands of passes, but it clearly defines an approach with no fundamental limits. This is very important. I am looking forward to his Siggraph paper this year.\n\nOnce I set down and started writing new renderers targeted at GeForce level performance, the precision issue has started to bite me personally. There are quite a few times where I have gotten visible banding after a set of passes, or have had to worry about ordering operations to avoid clamping. There is nothing like actually dealing with problems that were mostly theoretical before..\n\n64 bit pixels. It is The Right Thing to do.

We have played with some early versions, but this is a paper evaluation.

Yes, I like NV_register_combiners a lot, but come on..\n\nThe DDR GeForce is the reigning champ of 3D cards. Of the shipping boards, it is basically better than everyone at every aspect of 3D graphics, and pioneered some features that are going to be very important: signed pixel math, dot product blending, and cubic environment maps.\n\nThe GeForce2 is just a speed bumped GeForce with a few tweaks, but that's not a bad thing. Nvidia will have far and away the tightest drivers for quite some time, and that often means more than a lot of new features in the real world.\n\nThe nvidia register combiners are highly programmable, and can often save a rendering pass or allow a somewhat higher quality calculation, but on the whole, I would take ATI's third texture for flexibility.\n\nNvidia will probably continue to hit the best framerates in benchmarks at low resolution, because they have flexible hardware with geometry acceleration and well-tuned drivers.\n\nGeForce is my baseline for current rendering work, so I can wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nATI Marketing silliness: \"charisma engine\" and \"pixel tapestry\" are silly names for vertex and pixel processing that are straightforward improvements over existing methods. Sony is probably to blame for starting that.\n\nThe Radeon has the best feature set available, with several advantages over GeForce:\n\nA third texture unit per pixel \nThree dimensional textures \nDependent texture reads (bump env map) \nGreater internal color precision. \nUser clip planes orthogonal to all rasterization modes. \nMore powerful vertex blending operations. \nThe shadow id map support may be useful, but my work with shadow buffers have shown them to have significant limitations for global use in a game.\n\nOn paper, it is better than GeForce in almost every way except that it is limited to a maximum of two pixels per clock while GeForce can do four. This comes into play when the pixels don't do as much memory access, for example when just drawing shadow planes to the depth/stencil buffer, or when drawing in roughly front to back order and many of the later pixels depth fail, avoiding the color buffer writes.\n\nDepending on the application and algorithm, this can be anywhere from basically no benefit when doing 32 bit blended multi-pass, dual texture rendering to nearly double the performance for 16 bit rendering with compressed textures. In any case, a similarly clocked GeForce(2) should somewhat outperform a Radeon on today's games when fill rate limited. Future games that do a significant number of rendering passes on the entire world may go back in ATI's favor if they can use the third texture unit, but I doubt it will be all that common.\n\nThe real issue is how quickly ATI can deliver fully clocked production boards, bring up stable drivers, and wring all the performance out of the hardware. This is a very different beast than the Rage128. I would definitely recommend waiting on some consumer reviews to check for teething problems before upgrading to a Radeon, but if things go well, ATI may give nvidia a serious run for their money this year.\n\n3DFX Marketing silliness: Implying that a voodoo 5 is of a different class than a voodoo 4 isn't right. Voodoo 4 max / ultra / SLI / dual / quad or something would have been more forthright.\n\nRasterization feature wise, voodoo4 is just catching up to the original TNT. We finally have 32 bit color and stencil. Yeah.\n\nThere aren't any geometry features.\n\nThe T buffer is really nothing more than an accumulation buffer that is averaged together during video scanout. This same combining of separate buffers can be done by any modern graphics card if they are set up for it (although they will lose two bits of color precision in the process). At around 60 fps there is a slight performance win by doing it at video scannout time, but at 30 fps it is actually less memory traffic to do it explicitly. Video scan tricks also usually don't work in windowed modes.\n\nThe real unique feature of the voodoo5 is subpixel jittering during rasterization, which can't reasonably be emulated by other hardware. This does indeed improve the quality of anti-aliasing, although I think 3dfx might be pushing it a bit by saying their 4 sample jittering is as good as 16 sample unjittered.\n\nThe saving grace of the voodoo5 is the scalability. Because it only uses SDR ram, a dual chip Voodoo5 isn't all that much faster than some other single chip cards, but the quad chip card has over twice the pixel fill rate of the nearest competitor. That is a huge increment. Voodoo5 6000 should win every benchmark that becomes fill rate limited.\n\nI haven't been able to honestly recommend a voodoo3 to people for a long time, unless they had a favorite glide game or wanted early linux Xfree 4.0 3D support. Now (well, soon), a Voodoo5 6000 should make all of today's games look better than any other card. You can get over twice as many pixel samples, and have them jittered and blended together for anti-aliasing.\n\nIt won't be able to hit Q3 frame rates as high as GeForce, but if you have a high end processor there really may not be all that much difference for you between 100fps and 80fps unless you are playing hardcore competitive and can't stand the occasional drop below 60fps.\n\nThere are two drawbacks: it's expensive, and it won't take advantage of the new rasterization features coming in future games.

We had quite a bit of discussion about whether we should be showing anything at all, considering how far away we are from having a title on the shelves, so we probably aren't going to be showing it anywhere else for quite a while.\n\nWe do run a bit better on a high end wintel system, but the Apple performance is still quite good, especially considering the short amount of time that the drivers had before the event.\n\nIt is still our intention to have a simultaneous release of the next product on Windows, MacOS-X, and Linux.\n\nHere is a dump on the GeForce 3 that I have been seriously working with for a few weeks now:\n\nThe short answer is that the GeForce 3 is fantastic. I haven't had such an impression of raising the performance bar since the Voodoo 2 came out, and there are a ton of new features for programmers to play with.\n\nGraphics programmers should run out and get one at the earliest possible time. For consumers, it will be a tougher call. There aren't any applications our right now that take proper advantage of it, but you should still be quite a bit faster at everything than GF2, especially with anti-aliasing. Balance that against whatever the price turns out to be.\n\nWhile the Radeon is a good effort in many ways, it has enough shortfalls that I still generally call the GeForce 2 ultra the best card you can buy right now, so Nvidia is basically dethroning their own product.\n\nIt is somewhat unfortunate that it is labeled GeForce 3, because GeForce 2 was just a speed bump of GeForce, while GF3 is a major architectural change. I wish they had called the GF2 something else.\n\nThe things that are good about it:\n\nLots of values have additional internal precision, like texture coordinates and rasterization coordinates. There are only a few places where this matters, but it is nice to be cleaning up. Rasterization precision is about the last thing that the multi-thousand dollar workstation boards still do any better than the consumer cards.\n\nAdding more texture units and more register combiners is an obvious evolutionary step.\n\nAn interesting technical aside: when I first changed something I was doing with five single or dual texture passes on a GF to something that only took two quad texture passes on a GF3, I got a surprisingly modest speedup. It turned out that the texture filtering and bandwidth was the dominant factor, not the frame buffer traffic that was saved with more texture units. When I turned off anisotropic filtering and used compressed textures, the GF3 version became twice as fast.\n\nThe 8x anisotropic filtering looks really nice, but it has a 30%+ speed cost. For existing games where you have speed to burn, it is probably a nice thing to force on, but it is a bit much for me to enable on the current project. Radeon supports 16x aniso at a smaller speed cost, but not in conjunction with trilinear, and something is broken in the chip that makes the filtering jump around with triangular rasterization dependencies.\n\nThe depth buffer optimizations are similar to what the Radeon provides, giving almost everything some measure of speedup, and larger ones available in some cases with some redesign.\n\n3D textures are implemented with the full, complete generality. Radeon offers 3D textures, but without mip mapping and in a non-orthogonal manner (taking up two texture units).\n\nVertex programs are probably the most radical new feature, and, unlike most \"radical new features\", actually turn out to be pretty damn good. The instruction language is clear and obvious, with wonderful features like free arbitrary swizzle and negate on each operand, and the obvious things you want for graphics like dot product instructions.\n\nThe vertex program instructions are what SSE should have been.\n\nA complex setup for a four-texture rendering pass is way easier to understand with a vertex program than with a ton of texgen/texture matrix calls, and it lets you do things that you just couldn't do hardware accelerated at all before. Changing the model from fixed function data like normals, colors, and texcoords to generalized attributes is very important for future progress.\n\nHere, I think Microsoft and DX8 are providing a very good benefit by forcing a single vertex program interface down all the hardware vendor's throats.\n\nThis one is truly stunning: the drivers just worked for all the new features that I tried. I have tested a lot of pre-production 3D cards, and it has never been this smooth.\n\nThe things that are indifferent:\n\nI'm still not a big believer in hardware accelerated curve tessellation. I'm not going to go over all the reasons again, but I would have rather seen the features left off and ended up with a cheaper part.\n\nThe shadow map support is good to get in, but I am still unconvinced that a fully general engine can be produced with acceptable quality using shadow maps for point lights. I spent a while working with shadow buffers last year, and I couldn't get satisfactory results. I will revisit that work now that I have GeForce 3 cards, and directly compare it with my current approach.\n\nAt high triangle rates, the index bandwidth can get to be a significant thing. Other cards that allow static index buffers as well as static vertex buffers will have situations where they provide higher application speed. Still, we do get great throughput on the GF3 using vertex array range and glDrawElements.\n\nThe things that are bad about it:\n\nVertex programs aren't invariant with the fixed function geometry paths. That means that you can't mix vertex program passes with normal passes in a multipass algorithm. This is annoying, and shouldn't have happened.\n\nNow we come to the pixel shaders, where I have the most serious issues. I can just ignore this most of the time, but the way the pixel shader functionality turned out is painfully limited, and not what it should have been.\n\nDX8 tries to pretend that pixel shaders live on hardware that is a lot more general than the reality.\n\nNvidia's OpenGL extensions expose things much more the way they actually are: the existing register combiners functionality extended to eight stages with a couple tweaks, and the texture lookup engine is configurable to interact between textures in a list of specific ways.\n\nI'm sure it started out as a better design, but it apparently got cut and cut until it really looks like the old BumpEnvMap feature writ large: it does a few specific special effects that were deemed important, at the expense of a properly general solution.\n\nYes, it does full bumpy cubic environment mapping, but you still can't just do some math ops and look the result up in a texture. I was disappointed on this count with the Radeon as well, which was just slightly too hardwired to the DX BumpEnvMap capabilities to allow more general dependent texture use.\n\nEnshrining the capabilities of this mess in DX8 sucks. Other companies had potentially better approaches, but they are now forced to dumb them down to the level of the GF3 for the sake of compatibility. Hopefully we can still see some of the extra flexibility in OpenGL extensions.\n\nThe future:\n\nI think things are going to really clean up in the next couple years. All of my advocacy is focused on making sure that there will be a completely clean and flexible interface for me to target in the engine after DOOM, and I think it is going to happen.\n\nThe market may have shrunk to just ATI and Nvidia as significant players. Matrox, 3D labs, or one of the dormant companies may surprise us all, but the pace is pretty frantic.\n\nI think I would be a little more comfortable if there was a third major player competing, but I can't fault Nvidia's path to success."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": 982894200, "contents": "Welcome to id Software's Finger Service V1.5!\n\nName: John Carmack\nEmail: johnc@idsoftware.com\nDescription: Programmer\nProject: \nLast Updated: 02/22/2001 21:02:26 (Pacific Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFeb 22, 2001\n------------\nI just got back from Tokyo, where I demonstrated our new engine \nrunning under MacOS-X with a GeForce 3 card.

For existing games where you have speed to burn, it is probably a \nnice thing to force on, but it is a bit much for me to enable on the current \nproject.  Radeon supports 16x aniso at a smaller speed cost, but not in \nconjunction with trilinear, and something is broken in the chip that \nmakes the filtering jump around with triangular rasterization \ndependencies.\n\nThe depth buffer optimizations are similar to what the Radeon provides, \ngiving almost everything some measure of speedup, and larger ones \navailable in some cases with some redesign.\n\n3D textures are implemented with the full, complete generality.  Radeon \noffers 3D textures, but without mip mapping and in a non-orthogonal \nmanner (taking up two texture units).\n\nVertex programs are probably the most radical new feature, and, unlike \nmost \"radical new features\", actually turn out to be pretty damn good.  \nThe instruction language is clear and obvious, with wonderful features \nlike free arbitrary swizzle and negate on each operand, and the obvious \nthings you want for graphics like dot product instructions.\n\nThe vertex program instructions are what SSE should have been.\n\nA complex setup for a four-texture rendering pass is way easier to \nunderstand with a vertex program than with a ton of texgen/texture \nmatrix calls, and it lets you do things that you just couldn't do hardware \naccelerated at all before.  Changing the model from fixed function data \nlike normals, colors, and texcoords to generalized attributes is very \nimportant for future progress.<b"}, {"by": "johnp@3drealms.com", "time": 1007511480, "contents": "Account Name:  John Pollard\nEmail address: johnp@finger.3drealms.com"}, {"by": "johnr@idsoftware.com", "time": 763963200, "contents": "[idsoftware.com]\nLogin name: johnr     \t\t\tIn real life: John Romero\nDirectory: /cthulhu/Users/johnr     \tShell: /bin/csh\nLast login Fri Mar 18 02:38 on ttyp1 from F181-173.net.wis\nPlan:\nTHE PLAN:\n\nTo get the entire world running NEXTSTEP for development,\nget everyone connected on the Internet, and own a Testarossa TR512.\n\nDOS blows.

You can set/unset any of these options.\n* The new style of mouse movement will set the standard for all future\n        action games; it's that amazing.\n* All options are totally changeable, while you play the game. You\n        want to increase your normal walking speed threshold to the running\n        speed threshold, no problem. (This means that you won't have to hold\n        down a 'RUN' key, it will always be running! The RUN key can be used\n        to slow you down if you want.) This works with any controller used\n        with Quake.     Everything can be changed in real time.\n\nSony PSX DOOM: The very best version of DOOM on the planet. All music and\nsound effects have been totally trashed and new ones created. It feels like\nyou are playing a movie.  This should really be Sony's flagship product. It\nshould be out when the PSX is released.\n\nSNES DOOM: Will be out September 1st.\n\nUltra64 DOOM (3?): The character models are completely amazing.\n\nMacUltimate DOOM: We're working on getting it done.\n\nHexen: Beyond Heretic (H2): So damn cool. The very best game in the\ncurrent crop of DOOM-clones.  It slams everything out there; very dark,\nvery eerie and the audio/visual feedback is totally and completely immersive.\nScreen shots to be released soon.\n\nStrife: Screen shots to be released soon.\n\n---\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| John Romero (romero@idsoftware.com) id Software                   |\n| Send questions about id software to help@idsoftware.com           |\n| ftp.idsoftware.com                Official id anonymous FTP site  |\n| www.idsoftware.com                Official id Web site            |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nOooooh, you're fingering me again.\n\n"}, {"by": "jparkman@legendent.com", "time": 981052740, "contents": ""}, {"by": "jpw@nervesoftware.com", "time": 1018374780, "contents": "Welcome to Nerve Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Joe Waters\nEmail: jpw@nervesoftware.com\nDescription: Technical Director\nProject: WolfMP\nNickname: gunfu\nWeb Page: Nerve Software's Web Site\nLast Updated: 11/14/2001 19:21:13 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n14 November 01\n==============\n...so I made a big stink about getting a .plan facility turned on \nfor Nerve, so I oughta at least put it to reasonable use so \nBrandon doesn't feel like I wasted his time --\n\nre: mptest2, you know that thing that came out some days ago\n\n...just for the record, since I've seen a couple comments on different sites about this, as far as I know the mouse code has *not changed* at all.  not a bit.  The only thing that might have changed is the sensitivity setting (we shipped a wolfconfig.cfg with the first mptest, this one has different defaults).  So if you're unhappy with mouse performance, load mptest1, look at your mouse setting, and make the setting the same in mptest2.\n\nThere are some graphic oddities with mptest2: when the video mode auto-adjusty winky runs, it might turn off dynamic lights, which are needed (in mptest2) for dynamite status info, so make sure to turn that back on. Also, it may turn on trilinear mipmapping, which\nmight be a significant performance hit on some cards; so if it feels slower than mptest1, try setting that back to bilinear filtering.  The rendering architecture hasn't changed substantially ('cept for flamethrower stuff) and neither has the map, so the speed difference should really be negligable.\n\nwhee.  look, I'm the first Nerve guy to do a real live useful .plan update\n\nfinger me baby\n\n\n8 November 01\n=============\nYup.  .plan files and everything."}, {"by": "jschuur@planetquake.com", "time": 906537120, "contents": "User:   jschuur\nRead:   0\nUnread: 1051\nTime:   Wed, 23 Sep 1998 02:52:02 -0700\nPlan:\n/September 23rd/\n\ni'm trying to update this a bit more often, so you guys can get\na feel for who i am...\n\nmy bookmarks rock. i just spent 3 hours digging around and finally\nbookmarking a lot of sites i usually visit casually and then some.\ni use netscape 4.0 and incase you didn't know, you can use the\n'personal toolbar' to add folders too. if you keep the folder names\nshort (i limit mine to 1-2 characters), you can fit about 12-15\nof them in a row on a standard width browser (fullscreening your \nbrowser on anything above 640x480 is just plain wrong). this way\ni can emulate another row of dropdown menues and can access my\nbookmark categories quicker.\n\ni'm super methodical about how i structure my bookmark hierarchy \ntoo. gotta keep up with the competition somehow and know who's\nout there and doing what. my only gripe is i can't name the little\nseperator entries.\n\ni just need more time. i'm bursting with ideas and plans and\nonly have so many hours a day (about 24). the fall gaming season\nisn't exactly going to help. i think i'm just going to give up \nsleep. i mean... what's the point? why would i want to be \nunconcious for 6-8 hours a day?\n\nplanetcrap.com (nope, not one of our network sites ;) has been\ndigging up some interesting stories lately and getting some\ngood discussion threads going. if you want to see some postings\nof core people here at the pq network spilling out their guts\nabout who we are and why we do what we do, stop by. \ncongratulations morn and the rest of the gang on putting together\na good niche site.\n\noh, and i'm growing a goatee again. let's see how long i last\nthis time,\n\n\nJoost Schuur \nPlanetQuake Network Hosting Manager\nhttp://www.planetquake.com/\n"}, {"by": "jscott@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 1034965740, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: John Scott\nEmail: jscott@ravensoft.com\nDescription: Programmer\nProject: SoF2\nLast Updated: 10/18/2002 14:00:20 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNick: Pagan\nProject: Plate Tectonic Pressure Release 4\n\nDisclaimer - The opinions expressed herein are personal and\nin no way represent that of Raven Software or Activision.\n\n18/10/02\n\nNon game related...\n\nA couple of old fogies here went to see The Damned last night;\nmore for nostaglia than anything else.

Recently, I\u00c2\u0092ve been playing a \ncertain role-playing video game with some fellow co-workers over the past few lunch hours.  \nOne particular partner of mine found out he was able to edit our characters and, to make \nthe game more interesting, he boosted up the gold for them.  We decided to play this way \nin secret as to not ruin the playing experience of the other non-cheaters; one of whom \nincluded Brian Raffel.  Our cover was blown when Brian and I both died and we each picked \nup each other\u00c2\u0092s gold by accident.  Brian originally had 6,000 gold collected but now had \nmy 90,000.  A simple mistake, but now people knew what we had done.  At the time, I didn\u00c2\u0092t \nthink anything was wrong with cheating in a game, but sad to say, Brian no longer played \nwith us and in his eyes, I am eternally condemned as a \u00c2\u0093game cheater\u00c2\u0094.\n\nThis made me wonder as to what I had really missed out on by playing this way. I was able \nto purchase items that kept me alive longer.  I still experienced fighting bosses and \nexploring, just not dieing so much.  For me, I hate dieing in games repeatedly.  If I die \ntoo much at the same point, the game no longer becomes fun.  With virtually unlimited gold, \nI didn\u00c2\u0092t have to worry about collecting lots of other worthless things to sell at the \nlocal shop.  This saved a lot of time.  For me, if a game takes too many hours to win, \nit no longer becomes fun; I think.  I guess I had lost out on experiencing the \u00c2\u0093worrying\u00c2\u0094 \npart of the game.  What was coming up?  Would I have enough health?  What if I don\u00c2\u0092t have \nwhat I need?  Had my ideas of what makes a game fun really changed so much since becoming \na developer?  I\u00c2\u0092m curious as to how many other people cheat in video games and how much it \nadds to, or subtracts from, the total game playing experience.  Maybe I\u00c2\u0092ve just become more \nimpatient in my \u00c2\u0093more mature\u00c2\u0094 years (23 is getting up there).  I\u00c2\u0092m not saying that it\u00c2\u0092s \nhard for me to have fun playing games anymore; just that if I am going to beat a single \ngame with a definite beginning and end, there is a certain time frame that it needs to be \ndone in and I mustn\u00c2\u0092t \u00c2\u0093worry\u00c2\u0094 too much.  These are things I tend to think on.  Feel free \nto e-mail me on this topic to help me finish out this train of thought.  Maybe it's just\ntoo early in the morning for me.\n\nAs to what I am working on currently; I am building some models for one of our yet-to-be-\nannounced games.  We have just gotten some estimates as to the number of polygons we have \nto play with, and I am very pleased.

There is some interesting\nstuff going on in those games that I've not seen done before. John Scott's terrain system in particular looks\nvery striking. For those that saw it (and JKII) at QuakeCon I think I can speak for most here when I say\na huge thank you for all the kind words that have been directed at us. This makes a difference to us here\nin many many ways. I think every developer gets revitalised when they know that people are looking forward\nto what we are building.\n\nIn other stuff, I've been playing StarTopia recently, much the annoyance of my wife. I can heartily\nrecommend that one. It's fun stuff. Max Payne keeps winking at me from the shelf saying \"Play me. Go on, \nplay me!

Also, this is the .plan of an artist employed at ION Storm. You have been warned.\n\n\n11-19-97\n\nIf anyone knows of a good 2d/Photoshop artist that's really good with medieval themes, could you send them my way or e-mail me? It would require moving to Dallas too. I only want to see 2d samples of drawings or 2d computer work.\n\n11-17-97\n\nWell, this Friday is my last day here. Sniff, sniff. I'm leaving to pursue a career in the WWF as \"The Mad Somoan\". Just kidding. I'm really moving to the closest thing I've ever had to a hometown, Austin, to join Warren Spector's ex-Looking Glass team and an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of new game. \n\nI've been here for nine months and indeed it has been a wild ride. I was the second artist to arrive through the doors of ION. At the time, I was entertaining thoughts of heading to the west coast, which I was reluctant to do because I wasn't raised in a dysfunctional environment and am actually rather fond of my family. So I made the decision to make the short trek from Austin to Dallas rather than head to \"Hollyweird\". \n\nI had never seen so many people as passionate about their games until I came here. There is such an overwhelming atmosphere of competition whether it be flag football, foosball, Quake, Age of Empires, Doom, Tekken3, or Omega Race (Omega Race?!) I think it will come across in our games.\n\nI think I can safely say that I modelled about %80 perecent of the character models without being pelted by my fellow artists and am really proud of how they came out with minimal pounding by Brian and Jerry. I put a lot of myself into these models and I really hope they knock the socks off people. Even more amazing, I'm walking away from them, pretty confident that what I saved off of as a final object will survive the tweaking process to lunge at me when I play Daikatana for the first time. I have complete faith in the folks that are breathing life into them as we speak and that is so, so rare. Ken, Ron, and Murphy have their work cut out for them.\n\nI want to thank the Daikatana team\n\n-John Romero for creating the most badass sandbox to play in.\n-Jerry O' Flaherty for taking the chance on me.\n-Bryan Pritchard for understanding you can take the Mad Somoan out of Austin, but you can't take the Austin out of the Mad Somoan\n-Mike Wilson for actually hearing me out on a few of my weird ideas\n-Andy and Andy for Andyland\n-Dabug, Sverre, Rescoe and Dr. Sleep for surpassing my expectations\n-Ron for being my Age of Empires buddy\n-Murphy for being the cynical Mormon nubian-lovin' guy that he is\n-Chuck for wising up and finally leaving the \"lame-O\"\n-Jim for reminding me that I'm a frustrated comic artist\n-Ken for reminding me that I'm a frustrated painter\n-Kee for never throwing anything at me\n-Shawn for telling it like it is\n-Will Loconto for letting me meet a rockstar! Really, I loved Information Society!\n-Nelno the Amoeba for gifting us with his protoplasm\n-Voin for inventing Tetris\n-Rooster for not pointing out the child labor law violations\n-Russell and Clay for joining the Austin train\n\nAs much as I loved being on this team, Dallas is just not my cup of tea and one thing my life as a military-brat pointed out, \"You don't have to live where you don't want to\". So as much as I enjoy working with Romero and crew, going back down to Austin is my chance to live in a great city and still work at a great company. In other words it's my chance to have my cake and eat it too.\n\nSome people see this company either as a bunch of cocky egomaniacs trying to hype themselves as rock stars or a passionate and innovative experiment in game design with a lightning bolt of business savvy on a grand scale. I think I like that.\n\nAnyways, all I can say for now is \"Hey Warren! Get that sandbox ready! Wahoo!\"\n\nP.S. Dallas sucks and yes, I'm still bitter about my truck getting broken into.\n\n11-12-97\n\nI just want to warn folks something. Don't finger my .plan manually. It's become a tad on the lengthy side. I'll figure out what to do with it eventually. Maybe after I find a publisher. Heh....\n\n11-11-97\n\nI just finished playing the dirtiest nastiest game of AoE I hope to ever play. And came out on the winning side. Awwww yeaaaa.\n\nThe Daikatana demo from the Frag is out finally. Hopefully there'll be more of my stuff in the next one. The satyr is the only a taste of what's to come. There's sixty more guys like him. Hope you dig it.\n\nBack to the battlefield! \n11-04-97\n\nSorry I missed the Frag folks, but I was out of commission with the flu. Ack. But I did manage to close on my house! Wahoo! I'm a homeowner! Eventually the impact of that will eventually hit me, but at least I have space for my Street Fighter II machine. Now I need to save up my lunch money for a jacuzzi....\n\nAnd good luck Gary, say hi to Sonya for me. I'm going to be bummed if you guys end up being millionairres before I do... :)\n\n\n10-24-97\n\nOk, no more submissions please.\n\n\n10-23-97\n\nJust to clarify some points on potential artist candidates. It requires relocation to Dallas and the emphasis is on 2d drawing skills. Also we're only looking for one artist.\n\n\n10-21-97\n\nHey we're hiring!\n\nWe're making some personnel changes really soon and several artists will be moving onto another project, so we're looking for a 2d texture artist for Dabug's medieval levels. The artist MUST HAVE TOP NOTCH DRAWING SKILLS and be proficient in Adobe Photoshop or an equivalent. Send samples to Jerry O'Flaherty at jerry@ionstorm.com or me and I'll forward them. You can also mail them to us at\n\n\n\n\n\n\tION Storm\n\n\t2200 Ross Ave. Suite 3050\n\n\tDallas TX 75201\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10-16-97\n\n\n\nDoh. Stormfront. Sorry guys.:) Do I really sound like that?

Anyways, it'll take all of two seconds for someone to guess where the Mad Somoan is in the photo. \n\n\n\nAnd Levelord, we know nothing about any fire, it must have been the sun's rays passing over some smog, or swamp gas or something and on that note, we know nothing of the missing 15 pounds of plutonium from Cassini for that matter.\n\n\n\nAlso, I'll be on Pseudo's Stormwatch tomorrow at 8 Eastern/ 7 Central.\n\n\n\n9-30-97\n\n\n\nHmmm. I just realized when I said I was happy with the way the chain gunner came out, it sounded like I modeled him, which actually I didn't. Murphy Michaels did. Maybe I'm just fried from doing so many models that I think I did models that I didn't even do. Maybe I meant I just really liked him a lot and was happy  for Murphy...Yea...\n\n\n\nAnyways, I think we'll be putting up more of our creatures up on our site, hell we've got sixty or so to eventually choose from, but no bosses will be posted.\n\n\n\nOh yeah. Check out Murphy's Doom Bat. He's neat!\n\n\n\n9-29-97\n\n\n\nWent to a Sci-Fi collector's convention this weekend. It was cool and Star Wars memorabilia was everywhere! There was a dealer that had the most impressive collection of original star wars figures still in the box that I've ever seen. They also had an impressive lineup of guests, David Prowse (Darth Vader), Phil Brown (Uncle Owen), Chase Masterson (Leeta, Deep Space Nine) and some Star Trek Voyager dude. Regretfully Warwick Davis cancelled. While some of my friends bought Star Wars stuff, all I did was pick up some trading cards of artists like Frazetta, Gil Elvgren, Ken Kelly, Olivia and about a dozen comic book graphic novels. Oh yeah, a little Speed Racer Mach 5 car too.\n\n\n\nUmm. Well we're finally confident enough to show a little of our art. There's some on our website. Just look in the Games section at the main menu. I'm pretty happy with the way the chain gunner came out.\n\n\n\n9-22-97\n\n\n\nWent to Ensemble's ship party last Friday and watched Romero suck it down. Not bad for someone that never played it before. Anyways, he's really digging it and is on a big Age of Empires kick now. It's pretty cool, but buggy. Tricia a.k.a. Sxygrl was in town. Spent the weekend recovering from Niqui's birthday and Tom's party afterward. \n\n\n\nFinally got a chance to watch my Gundam videos. I've been searching for the Mobile Suit Gundam episodes on tape for several years and finally found them. It's amazing how well the series holds up after fifteen years!\n\n\n\nDoing a minor overhaul on several character models to give them more personality and make them more dynamic. I'm really impressed with Final Fantasy VII and Abe's Odyssey's marketing campaign. Blitzkrieg baby, blitzkrieg!\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tread lightly.., for we are on the path to hell\"\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Ogami Ito \"Sword of Vengeance\"\n\n\n\n\n\n9-19-97\n\n\n\nI just wanted to offer my congrats to Sonya Roberts a.k.a. \"MsBarrows\" on her new job at Pseudointeractive as a level designer and artist. Pseudointeractive is a company started by ex-Origin Systems programmer and friend of mine, David Wu and several friends. David was only at Origin for several months before he got sick of the politics and corporate culture, but he made a hell of an impact there and had everyone eating out of his hand trying to get him to stay on. Right now they're working on an incredible looking vehicle combat game called Inertia. There are some pretty amazing things going on in the game, physics and lighting wise and that's just in DirectX. I'm looking forward to the 3dfx version in the near future. If you're interested, try bugging them at www.pseudointeractive.com into giving out their demo. At first impression, it's raw, the controls needs refining, and the levels are very, very basic, but hey, that's what Sonya's there for. Anyways, keep an eye out for Inertia in the future. David's going to go far in this industry, you can bet on it.\n\n\n\n \n\n9-10-97\n\n\n\nJust got back from this big weird uber-rave. Moby, Empirion, and 808 State were there among other acts. There were lots of fine women and good music. It got really weird during Aphex Twin's gig. Giant neon teddy bears, women in pink spandex on stilts, and even a streaker.\n\n\n\nPaul's .plan had nothing to do with me. I'm not the Jeff of \"Jeff and Andy\" that he was referring to although I bump into him every once in a blue moon.\n\n\n\nOur character/creature skins are going to be beeeyoootiful thanks to our secret weapon. Models too. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n9-07-97\n\n\n\nSheesh! I've been spending a lot of time in Austin lately. It's nice to see old bosses (Warren) and old teammates (Dave, Steve, and Kraig) come aboard. One thing I find amusing is how little the Quake community knows about Warren. ION Storm hired \"some dude named Warren Spector\" indeed.\n\n\n\nBeen playing Outlaws. Got stuck twice so far and had to consult a walkthrough guide. I'm not a gaming purist, unlike Romero. Sorry. However, I would like to thank Roger Tan for his informative Outlaws website and walkthrough guides. You rule!\n\n\n\n\n\n8-20-97\n\n\n\nWell, I've been moved into my warehouse loft digs and it's real cool. Totally bohemian and the iron girders give it \"ambience\". Now I need to save up for the downpayment to actually buy the thing instead of renting it. It's real quiet except for Fridays and Saturdays when everyone swarms into Deep Ellum for the nightlife and the occasional shooting murder, but I've got three other IONStorm neighbors to help in a nasty situation. Well.... Ok. I've got some nunchuks and bug spray.\n\n\n\nLooked at the Chasm demo. It's really cool and I can't wait until I see more. What I'm really looking forward to seeing more of is the X-Men TC. The models are great and the skins really utilize the models for all their worth. It'll be interesting seeing what else comes from John Gorden.\n\n\n\nDid a doublefeature of Event Horizon/Time Bandits. Time Bandits was better. Event Horizon was basically Aliens and a Clive Barker story. The sets were awesome though.\n\n\n\nAs for Daikatana, I'm busting them out and the animators are hot on my trail animating them. Maybe some previews will be put up soon. They're fly. The fledgling low-poly corp of artists are producing some quality models for Anachronox. Not bad for 2nd generation Paul Steed scions and that Squaresoft artist is like, good and stuff...\n\n\n\nAlso, I'm looking into learning level editing, as if I don't have enough things to do.\n\n\n\n8-15-97\n\n\n\nThresh may be the deathmatch king, but I can stuff 20 gumballs in my mouth. Suck it down.\n\n\n\n8-02-97\n\n\n\nDamn. I'm out of pumpkin seeds....Sigh.\n\n\n\n7-21-97\n\n\n\nWell last week was fun although my truck getting broke into yet again was kinda anticlimactic. :( What kind of moron picks/slim jims my doorlock, siphons the gas, steals the car registration, leaves the lights on, and leaves a drink coaster on my dashboard? This is getting pretty damn surreal. Hell, there ain't jack squat to steal thanks to previous break-ins. I'd think it's almost funny if I hadn't spent all Sunday trying to find someone to get a jumpstart from.\n\n\n\nWell, I did go to Quakecon. One of the first things I did was attend Paul Steed's seminar on low-poly modeling. I was pretty much up on most of the things Paul covered but it helped confirm I was on track with the approaches that I was taking towards the character models. If anyone was wondering who the hell the big dude was that Paul would periodically point to in the middle of the room, that was me. Paul's absolutely right about the hardware requirements for lowpoly modeling. A 486 DX2 and 3DSR4 is all it takes to model and animate game-quality real-time models.\n\n\n\nOne of the next things I did was hook up with Dan Rockwell from ADV films. They distribute a lot of manga and asian films and I've been corresponding with him over e-mail for several months, trying to score some free stuff AND IT WORKED! Woohoo! They've got a pretty cool selection and they're a pretty classy setup overall. They've got quite a few familiar hit titles that I didn't know they distributed and they're not overzealous in their appreciation for manga unlike a lot of \"otaku\" I've encountered. Keep me up to date on new releases Dan! And stay cool!\n\n\n\nFinally met Thresh! After bumping into him down in the convention center, Romero and crew went up to Centaur Interactive's suite and we shot the shit with him. I even got to watch him handily smack down challengers over at Romero's Thursday and Friday night. Watching him play is like...a religeous experience. Over those two nights, he beat Romero, Paradox, Killcreek, Shadow, and Voin. Usually into negative scores too. I considered playing him for about .0001 seconds before I realized I would have nightmare episodes so brutal they would make me curl up into a fetal position after he would get through with me.\n\n\n\nSaw the id guys there. Romero and Carmack chewed the fat over (what else?) their Ferraris. Some other guys I met were Onethumb, Zoid, Nash Werner (from PCGames Online), and the notorious Blue! Voin, Vertigo, and I did a little RealAudio for Nash, but guess what? All it does is play Blue's interview! Wassupwitdat? :)\n\n\n\nI saw Hexen2 over there. It's lookin' good. Looking forward to its release.\n\n\n\nI finally got to meet Tricia or \"sexxygrrl\" on #Quake. She's the Eidos rep that was tromping around the IONStorm gig at the Harvey hotel in the slinky black dress. She's an interesting gal. Are you ready for this? She's asian, into asian cooking, comics, skating, hong kong movies, VERY into manga, and I hear VERY VERY into Tombraider2. \"But\" she's taken. Oh well...\n\n\n\nI've gotten to see both Tom and John's houses. They're very cool, but damn, what a commute!\n\n\n\nAnyways, I'm moving out of my roachmotel of an apartment and into Cleaner's old loft in the \"Stormdorm\". Should be cool. I have the feeling many an Ionstormer will be stopping by when they have a few yaegermeisters too many... That should take some of the load off of Doug \"Fresh\". Poor Doug would be macking on some girls and all of sudden \"knock, knock!!! Oh, gee guys, how nice of you to stop by...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFavorite quote this week:\n\n\n\n\n\nSverre (to Thresh): \"Um..how'd you get the rocket to bend around that wall?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n7-17-97\n\n\n\nGoing to QuakeCon later on, tell ya how it was soon. \n\n\n\nThe Master of Infernal Noise is doing some of the freakiest music I've ever heard right now. Sends shivers down my spine. \n\n\n\nHeard there were more layoffs at Origin and some of my friends got let go:( \n\n\n\nI saw Wild Arms this week. Really cool and the music is out of this world. \n\n\n\nAlso, Voin seems to have developed a new superpower. All he has to do is kneel next to a computer and without touching it, it will reboot. We did a background check on him and discovered he was indeed born in Chernobyl. I'm bringing some microwave dinners from home tomorrow to help him test his next superpower in development.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n7-10-97\n\n\n\nCocky little artists whose names rhyme with \"groin\" that manipulate other artists' .plan files should be subjected to a christening ala Jake Hughes syle or be made to smell Todd Porter's finger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-9-97\n\n\n\nWell poopie.... We had a little tourney here last night to decide who'll represent ION Storm in the Quakecon celebrity (or was that celery) deathmatch contest and I didn't make the cut. Just barely got edged out... Ok, ok, I was thirteenth out of sixteen. Anyways those that made the cut were Voin, Indigo, (Lord) Shadow, and Squirrel. Not a big surprise there I guess. Since Voin kinda had the most frags after the five rounds, now he's got a big head and is demanding that we all drink only Fresca soda, wear sportscoats and learn Russican because he's too damn lazy to speak English. We're pooling our lunch money together to put a contract out on him, but wait, who would do awesome low poly stuff? (my dog?). After Quakecon, that is...Oh yeah, I think Romero placed seventh.\n\n\n\nI contemplated growing my hair out like Romero, but with my curly locks and dark complexion, I think I'd end up looking like Slash. \n\n\n\n7-8-97\n\n\n\nMy, oh my, it's been a busy week! I'm looking forward to QuakeCon and might be doing a little deathmatching in preparation. I had a relatively safe 4th of July weekend, mostly staying in touch with old friends and just overall chillin'. Some of us went to Billy's Society of the Damned gig at The Galaxy Club. I thought their posters were so cool that I just had to go! Anyways, we played a little pool with the Cat Daddy and a friend, hung with Rob Atkins and I even spied a large contingent of Prey team members there. What really made my day was that a couple guys from Boston e-mailed me the day before about potential hotels in the Dallas area if they were to fly in to see SoTD (and catch some Dallas sights). Well, these guys ACTUALLY SHOWED UP at the club and we gave them the whirlwind tour of the ION digs afterwards in exchange for a ride back.  \n\n\n\nI have seen into the abyss called John Romero and it's....hmmm."}, {"by": "jweier@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 958162860, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Josh Weier\nEmail: jweier@mail.ravensoft.com\nDescription: Programmer\nProject: Star Trek\nLast Updated: 05/12/2000 17:05:46 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI've noticed in a few recent articles that there seems to be misconceptions \nabout our team and normal NPC AI.

Now, we've heard all the remarks about why the game was released with multiplayer in it's current state in the first place, and we've heard many comments about the number of bugs and such.  All I can say is that if you were walking in our shoes at the time, you'd have made the same decisions we did.  Your comments are still valuable to us as they do go into the mix of information the next time we are in a pressure situation.\n\nThe patch is going to be great.  We know it had been promised before the holidays, but this patch (about 10mg)is jam packed with stuff, including some new multiplay levels for CTF.  I believe we're coming down to the final days of testing, so keep watching for it.\n\nThe Add-on pack is coming along well.  I understand that GT is planning an early spring release, so folks don't have to wait too long.  The levels for the additional episode are nearly done.  We just need our engineers to get some time to work on the code to add the AI, weapons, creatures, and multiplay features.  \n\nGuess that's about it.  The Holidays were wonderful.  It was a good opportunity for the Blood 2 and Shogo teams to catch up with families, friends, and sleep for more than four hours in a row.  We have a New Years resolution.  Everything will ship on time, and there won't be need for patches!  \n\nCheers.11/1/98\nYikes! has it been that long since I updated a plan file. \n\nBlood II is looking great.  The demo was released last Friday night.  I haven't a clue on the download numbers, but I know GT was working their tail ends off to ensure a good deal of hype for us.\n\nAt this point, the game is nearly ready to call Gold.  We can't hardly wait. We have heard a good deal of feedback from all you folks about our late release.  The truth is, the world ain't perfect, things just don't always come together as we'd all planned, and we're just working really, really hard at not missing the release date by too much.  \n\nThe Blood II team is truly working endless hours to put the last touches on the product.  GT Interactive has been working endless hours to provide us with a good deal of support, feedback, and test results.  Together, with GT, we'll decide exactly when Blood II is ready togo.  In the meantime, every build that hits QA is one step closer.  And, the upside in all this is, until we ship, the team is eating really well . . . thanks Rick!\n\n\n\n\n7/6/98\nWell, I got a nasty message this morning about my lack of attention to my plan file, so it must be time for an update.\n\nRight now, the Blood 2 team is hard at work adding all kinds of cool, fun stuff to the game.  GT's marketing effort is gearing up.  Should start to see the media hype build.\n\nOur Web doodz have scraped together some moments to participate with Microsoft and their Chrome technology.  Spencer has developed a really cool demo using Shogo material.  If you're at Siggraph, you'll have to check it out.\n\nAlso continuing progress on a project yet to be named.  Guess all I can say is that good progress is being made. Hopefully, we'll have more on this one pretty soon.\n\nHope y'all had a great Independence holiday.  And, hope ya didn't lose any fingers to firecrackers.  Seattle had a rainy fourth, and wouldn't you know it, now that the holiday is past, it's sunshining.\n\n\n\n5/28/98\nWow, is it ever quiet around here.  Feels like a majority of the company shipped off to Atlanta for E3. Actually, I think that everyone worked so hard in preparation for E3 that those who didn't actually go are home recuperating/sleeping.  A good portion of the Blood 2 team has gone to Atlanta.  The GT Interactive and Monolith booths should be swarming with Blood 2 folks.  Participating in shows like E3 is exciting, fun, and necessary, but it's also hard, exhausting work.  Three days in a high energy, extremely visually stimulating environment can tend to make almost anyone crawl into a quiet corner.  \nI was privileged to go last year.  This year I volunteered to not go.  I'm not fond of flying, and feel it more beneficial for others to take part in this event.  Next year, the show will be on the west coast (not as far to fly)so maybe I'll get the opportunity to go again.\nBlood 2 is coming along so well.  We still have a good deal of work to do before it's released in the fall.  It is so cool to see all the pieces come together, and the levels actually play like a game and interact with you. I'm really anxious to hear the responses on the demo coming back from E3.  We sent two very awesome levels that Bill V. created.  \nBecause I'm involved with Blood 2, that's mostly what I think about, but Monolith Productions, for the first time, has our very own booth at E3.  We're showing Shogo: Mobile Armor Division (formerly Riot), Get Medieval, and some other Monolith titles which are still in production.  So watch for the excitement to continue building on each of those products.  Our marketing folks have been burning the candle at both ends to insure E3 will be a great experience for Monolith.  It's going to be pretty exciting around here in the fall when three games hit the retail shelves nearly simultaneously. \nThat's all for now.  Back to work for me.\n\n\n\n5/20/98\nWow, our plan files read like a movie critic's column.  Yes, we did see Godzilla this morning.  It was entertaining, but did appear to be a ripoff of other flicks already named.  The storylines were weak, and it was too predictable. \n\nEveryone at Monolith is focused on one goal these days.  E3!!  It's going to be exciting with the great products we'll be showing; Blood 2: The Chosen, Shogo (formerly Riot), Get Medieval, and Gruntz.  It's a pretty exciting lineup.\n\nThe Blood 2 team is working feverishly to make this game awesome.  Their dedication to quality is admirable to say the least.  The demo to be shown at E3 will be a testimony to their hard work.  For a game that is definitely \"work in progress\" the demo shows off some great features, and gives a player a teaser of the thrill and horror coming this fall.  We are already hearing the excitement build at GT.\n\nAnd, if releasing four games this year doesn't create enough activity in the halls of Monolith.  We are ramping up production of a new title, yet to be announced.  Planned release is early 2000.  So far, so good. The team is getting all the wheels in motion and we should have a good prototype demo going within the next few weeks.  This game is going to be totally different.  But, you'll just have to wait to learn more.\n\n\n4/28/98\nWhew!! One more milestone down, and only several more to go until Blood 2 release in the Fall.  The team is so dedicated as putting their best into every detail on this game.  It is truly going to be an awesome experience.  \n\nHave you visited the Blood 2 web site yet, or recently?  You better.  Jay is showing you all inside the hallows of Monolith, and into the abodes of many of the talented team members.  Be sure and keep watching the site as it will be updated weekly by various Blood 2 team members.\n\nAnd, we've got a whole team poised and ready to start production of a magnificent title for '99.  Only problem is, we have so many great game ideas, we don't know which one to do first.  We should know by tomorrow, and production will start immediately.  Should be exciting to watch, as usual.\n\n\n\n\n4/21/98\nWell, I'm just back from a wonderful week of vacation.  Actually, I had surgery for Carpal Tunnel on one wrist, so I spent a good deal of time doing absolutely nothing, with one hand suspended in the air.  Means my spouse and kids had to do everything.  I could get used to this.  It also means I type with only one hand for awhile.  Bad for productivity.\n\nGot another milestone for Blood 2 approaching on Friday.  The game features are coming along pretty quickly at this point.  We're pretty excited about the smashing new web site for the product.  If you haven't checked it out, you better do it soon, and often.\n\nJust getting another new project started.  Targeted for early '99.  We're in that scheduling stage where we put down all the cool stuff, then figure out how long it's going to take to develop, and how much it's gonna cost.  All the stuff nobody likes to think about because it tends to put a damper on creativity.  Oh well, we'll get through it, and quickly I hope, so we can be on the road to another great Monolith product.\n\n"}, {"by": "kee@ionstorm.com", "time": 878739840, "contents": "Ion Storm\n\nUser Name.........kee\nFull Name.........Kee Kimbrell\nDescription.......Code Boy\nLast NT Logon.....Wednesday, November 05, 1997 at 09:50\n\n\nThe whole gaming company has been living with this big pipe spewing out\ntons of sewage.\n\nTo the entity that shut it off I can only offer the following:\n\nfor (i = 0; i < MAXINT; i++)\n{\n    printf(\"THANK YOU!!!!!\\n\");\n}\n\n\n(File last updated on Wed 05 Nov 1997 at 10:16)"}, {"by": "kenneth@idsoftware.com", "time": 943236480, "contents": "Welcome to id Software's Finger Service V1.5!\n\nName: Kenneth Scott\nEmail: kenneth@idsoftware.com\nDescription: Artist\nProject: Quake 3 Arena\nLast Updated: 11/21/1999 22:08:05 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n11-21-1999\n\n  We're Gold!\n\n\n  I love you sweetpeach.  :)"}, {"by": "kev@gamespy.com", "time": 1013793300, "contents": "User:   kevplan\nRead:   0\nUnread: 0\nTime:   Fri, 15 Feb 2002 11:15:24 -0800\nPlan:\nkev@gamespy.com\n-----------------------------Home Page: www.cliffyb.com (seldom updated)\nemail: cliff@epicgames.com (rarely answered)\n---------------------------------------------\nMedal of Honor: Allied Assault\n\nBest single player FPS since Half-Life.

(gold Jerry! gold!)\n\nDuring a heated discussion yesterday, we came up with a solution that will simplify the way the talent animations work.  Basically, all of our talent animation lengths will conform to one of a few standard values so that it will be much easier to sync up the FX to the animations...  That is of course, unless we decide to rip out all the new code and go back to variable length talent anis again...\n\n*The theme song from Last of the Mohicans starts playing*\n*John LaCasse walks in*\n*Music fades out*\nKevin: Hey LaCasse... what's up?\nLaCasse: Dude... we are NOT going to rip out that new talent animation code.\nKevin: Whoah, how did you know that I just typed that?\nLaCasse: Dude, I will NOT waste my time writing this stuff if we aren't going to use it.\nKevin: Hey I was just kiddin man... we all agreed on it, remember?\nLaCasse: Dude, all I know is that component video is WAY better than standard video... it's totally tubular man.\nKevin: Whoah, are you feeling alright there man?\nLaCasse: Dude, it's JUST NOT POSSIBLE!  I gotta get outta here... there's a special on the discovery channel tonight about how to turn off the red gun on a projection screen television so that when you get hit in a game of Blood, you can still see what's going on.\nKevin: Uh, sure thing man... have fun.\nLaCasse: Dude...

It's been a few months since I last played Zelda 64.  I'm really looking forward to Donkey Kong 64 though... please let it have better gameplay than Banjo Kazooie... Not that I didn't like Banjo Kazooie, actually I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It's just that after collecting red feathers, gold feathers, eggs, notes, jinos, mumbo tokens, jiggys, and extra lives, I began to wish for a little more continuity in the game.\n\nAnyhow, enough about that!  Sanity is coming along very well.  Garrett is crankin' away on the script and deciding how best to unfold the story while making sure not to give too little or too much plot info away.  \n\nI finally finished the Psionic Talent list and am currently finishing up identifying where the player will acquire each of the talents.  After that, it's back to the boss encounters which is definitely one of the most fun aspects of the design of Sanity. :)\n\nFor those who haven't yet seen Sanity, be sure to check out the Sanity website at http://www.lith.com/sanity/.\n\nIf that's not enough for you, you might look at:\nhttp://www.ragesofsanity.com\nand\nhttp://pc.ign.com/previews/11237.html\n\nGPF.\n"}, {"by": "kevinc@idsoftware.com", "time": 1018985160, "contents": "Welcome to id Software's Finger Service V1.5!\n\nName: Kevin Cloud\nEmail: \nDescription: Artist\nProject: \nLast Updated: 04/16/2002 16:17:04 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n4-16\n\nI've been following the controversy over the recommended Wolf MP Punk Buster cvar restrictions.

Spen and Mike D. were sitting at the table enjoying a little lunch.

I instantly unleashed a devastating clothesline across the front of his neck taking him and his chair down to the ground.

What began many months ago as a port of the Playstation hit, Duke Nukem: Time To Kill, has evolved into an entirely unique game, unlike any other Duke Nukem game ever made. The guys at Eurocomm deserve a cheer and a pat on the back for all their hard work and single minded dedication. They have created what is, in my opinion, the best game for the Nintendo 64 since the release of Zelda 64. It will no doubt become one of the best 3rd person \"run 'n' gun\" games available for any system.\n\nThe game begins with Duke in the present day Earth Defense Force compound in New York City, receiving an urgent message on the video monitor. The message is from none other than himself, trapped somewhere in Earth's past. Aliens have travelled back in time to mess up key points in Earth's history. Duke went back in time to fight them, but along the way his time machine was destroyed, and unless the present day Duke travels through time and collects the pieces of the broken time machine, the future will forever be altered by the aliens' evil plot.\n\nSo begins Duke's greatest adventure yet. Before he is done he will visit many facinating places, including post-apocalyptic New York City, Fort Roswell (where Area 51 now stands), and a Waterworld-esque man made atoll. He will fly high on the Hindenburg and sink with the Titanic. He will meet interesting people, including General Custer and Jack The Ripper.\n\nNot just another great game, Duke Nukem:Zero Hour is also a feat of technical wizardry for the Nintendo 64. The game resides on a 32Mb cartridge, the largest currently available, and I have no doubt they used every last bit of that memory. Here are some of the amazing things this game accomplishes:\n\n1. It has more speech than any other N64 title, and the most speech of any Duke Nukem game on any system. Duke has something different to say for every occasion throughout the gameplay and cinematics. The other characters have plenty to say as well.\n\n2. The areas Duke visits are truly vast, and thanks to ingenious programming by the folks at Eurocomm, you won't ever see a foggy clipping plane. These worlds just stretch out seemingly forever.\n\n3. The variety of levels is nothing short of incredible. You get to visit New York City in three different time periods, as well as the Old West, Victorian England, and an alien mothership. The adventure spans across eighteen levels, most of which are huge. They are all re-entrant, allowing you to go back and find those secrets you missed the first time through. Even the most skilled players will enjoy 20 hours of gameplay or more.\n\n4. The graphics are varied and beautiful. All of the time zones are littered with countless posters, signs, pictures, and decorations, full of both useful information and gags. The enemies also wear costumes appropriate to their respective time zones. If you have the RAM Expansion Pak for your N64, you can play the game with high-res textures, making it even more of a visual treat.\n\n5. The control scheme is brilliant. There was a slight learning curve, but once I grew used to the controls, I found I could move around, aim, and circle strafe with all the ease of a mouse. \n\n6. Multiplayer \"Dukematch\" is included for up to four players.\n\n7. Eurocomm has included support for the Rumble Pak and, as I stated above, the RAM Expansion Pak. You can save your game progress on the Memory Card that plugs into your controller.\n\nDuke Nukem: Zero Hour should hit the shelves sometime during the next couple of months. I highly recommend it. Those of you starved for some Duke action should pick this title up and check it out. It's just the fix you need until Duke Nukem Forever ships.\n\nMONKEY DOES A SOFTWARE REVIEW (2/1/99)\n\nThis month I have neither an editoral nor an amusing anecdote of my private life. Instead, I was moved to write this review of a new release for the N64: Castlevania 64.\n\nCastlevania has always been one of my favorite series of console video games. They are all very similar to one another, even to the extent of sharing the same boss enemies, but I enjoy the emphasis on action and the exploration of creepy castle environs. I have always respected Konami as a company. On the NES they made three Castlevania games, two Contra games, and Metal Gear, all excellent. On the SNES we saw Super Castlevania and Super Contra, two of the best platform games for that system, as well as Axelay, which was my favorite shooter. On the Playstation, the Contra series went downhill, but they still gave us Metal Gear Solid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which I consider to be the best platform game ever made. \n\nYou can imagine my excitement when Konami announced a 3D Castlevania for the N64. The series would translate well into a 3rd person action game. As far as I was concerned, they didn't need to design anything new. They could borrow old enemies and environments from previous games in the series, make it 3D, and hand it over. I'd be happier than a clam exploring cobwebby dungeons, poisonous swamps, giant clock towers, evil churches, and whatever else ol' Drac wanted to put in his castle. Perhaps I'd get to meet familiar characters like Alucard from Symphony of the Night. When I found out it had been released last week, I drooled in anticipation.\n\nSaturday morning I was just about to head to EB and purchase one, when Allen walked in the door with a rental copy. Happily, I swiped it from him, plugged it in and watched the opening cinematic with heady anticipation. It was then that my world fell down around me. I am here to tell you, folks, that this game is an insult to the good name of Castlevania. I sometimes couldn't see the screen for all my tears. I have not yet finished the game, but I will continue to play, always hunting and hoping that the \"good part\" might be just around the corner.\n\nI've played about halfway through Castlevania 64, which is far enough to say with authority that the first level is pretty indicative of the gameplay throughout. The very first thing you do is hunt for a switch to open a gate in a boring maze. You then rinse and repeat a few more times. They are identical switches opening identical gates. While doing this, you fight off an endless onslaught of skeletons. Unfortunately, you can't really see the skeletons because you're constantly fighting the camera. The camera has four modes: Normal View, Action View, Battle View, and Boss View. I couldn't tell the difference between these modes, other than the text that is constantly on the screen telling me what mode I'm in. One of the few ways to have fun playing this game is to sing the \"Normal View\" song from MST3K: The Movie. \n\nThe first boss seems to be the club wielding skeleton of King Kong. This would be all right, except that he's accompanied by skeletons riding motorcycles. That's right, motorcycles. I realize that the Castlevania series often seems to have no set time frame, but let's keep it gothic, folks. I felt like I was participating in a Grateful Dead video. \n\nIn the second level you go inside the castle to discover the joys of exploring two nearly identical towers. At this point I realized that this game was to have no mood or environment at all. This is one time where a short clipping plane and distance fog would look really good, but it's not there. There's no creepy lighting at all. In fact, the entire castle seems to be lit up as bright as day. The first level was even devoid of music, for crying out loud. The rest of the game's music is only so-so, and barely audible. Also, the second level introduced us to a new enemy (making four different enemies, total, so far.) They were the familiar Medusa heads from previous Castlevania games, but the targeting cursor so obscured them that they just looked like floating red squares. You spend a lot of your time fighting floating red squares in this game. Couple that with all sorts of instant death jump puzzles and you've got one humdinger of a bad second level.\n\nThe third level almost looked good, and this small allowance is what kept me playing for as long as I did. The object of this level is to find a key, which unlocks another key, which gets the third key, and finally allows you to acquire the last key, which unlocks the gate to the next level. On level three you get to use the store for the first time, which is nice because the player was probably wondering why he was collecting money for the previous two levels. This store doesn't even come close to the huge variety of items available in Symphony of the Night. There are only about ten different items to choose from, here. \n\nThe fourth level adds to the intensity of gameplay by adding an extra element of unfairness. Fortunately, you can overcome this by taking advantage of a couple bugs in the game. You are pursued through a hedge maze by two unkillable dogs and one unkillable caretaker with a chainsaw. Need a quick breather? Jump off the beaten path and all the enemies freeze in mid animation, standing there like wax statues until you decide to jump back into their field of view.\n\nI played further, but that's all I've got to say for today. The most enjoyable aspect of Castlevania 64 is laughing your head off at all its myriad failures: the poor translations, the horribly animated characters, the terrible camera, the unremarkable music, the total lack of mood, and the redundant nature of the gameplay. But though I was laughing outwardly, I still silently wept for this horrible blow to the Castlevania series. Try again, Konami, and next time get it right.\n\n\n"}, {"by": "killcreek@ionstorm.com", "time": 918429480, "contents": "\n*** Ion Storm's Finger Server\n\nUser name: killcreek\nPlan modified: Sun Feb 07 18:49:17 1999\n\n*****************************************************************************\n* DISCLAIMER: Any views expressed here do not reflect the official position *\n* of Ion Storm or any other company of any sort.

There are no words for how fun the deathmatch is right now.. and we are still in the tweaking stages. Do not fear action fans, Daikatana is superfast, hardcore carnage at its best. Cool effects, useful features, awesome art, and some kickass levels are really coming together to make this game ROCK HARD (as our lead Artist Eric Smith would say..:)! This multiplayer demo will show off only a small fraction of the gibby goodness that will abound in the full product.. but you will get the idea :) The pure carnage is amazing!!\n\nXcalibur has done a great job with Storm Sector Seven (the map formerly known as Storm Sector Two). You can catch a tiny glimpse of it in a screenshot on the Daily Informant at http://www.ionstorm.com. Look close and you might even see the rain.. :) The weapon in that screenshot is the Shotcycler-6 -- one of the five Episode One weapons that will be available in the demo. \n\nThe coolest thing is this.. though we have known it all along, its finally starting to hit home that we are essentially making *FOUR DIFFERNT GAMES* all in one! Hello? I guess that fact wasn't real to me until we started making Episode One so badass and I realized we get to do this with *THREE MORE* sets of weapons and maps! Oh my GOD! Maybe I\u00c2\u0092m just slow, but the ultimate coolness of this fact is really hitting home these days more than ever before. The episodes will be very distinct and each has its own personality. I can assure you, Daikatana is going to be worth the wait. The DK team is indeed ROCK HARD and dedicated to making this game what it should be.\n\nCan you tell I'm excited? :)\n"}, {"by": "killcreek@ionstorm.com", "time": 941143260, "contents": "\n*** Ion Storm's Finger Server\n\nUser name: killcreek\nPlan modified: Thu Oct 28 17:13:06 1999\n\nOctober 28, 1999\n\n\nI want to wish a happy birthday to John Romero -- the most caring, funny, happy, and wonderful guy a girl could ever hope to find.\n\nm30w!\n\n\"Spread your wings baby fly with me\nAcross the sky of love and dreams...\"\n\n***\n\nGet ready..

The painted name, peeling and faded, on the door's unwashed glass \nproclaims that this is Joe's Coffee Emporium. Some emporium. Upon the walls, once painted \nwhite but now yellowed with nicotine, are cheaply framed prints of faraway places faded by\nthe years in direct sunlight. The floor's badly in need of a good mopping. The scuffed \nchecker-board linoleum looks to have accumulated fifty years worth of disgusting crud and \ndried urine. In fact, my shoes make a sickening sucking-squishing sound with every step I \ntake towards the counter. If I didn't need a cup of joe so badly I'd high-tail it outta \nhere.\n\n\tI gingerly take a seat at the counter upon a rickety stool uplholstered in red \nvinyl.

I rummage through my pants \npocket and throw a quarter and a dime onto the counter. \"Keep the change, sweetheart\". \nShe scoops up the coins, rings it up on an ancient cash register, dumps the change into the\ndrawer and slams it shut with a reverberating thud. Trixie then proceeds to wipe down the \ncounter with a rag that's even dirtier than the floor. \n\n\t While I'm sipping my coffee, which is surprisingly good, I decide to rummage \nthrough the good-looker's purse. Perhaps I can get her address from her license and return \nher belongings. To be frank, my motives for doing so are not purely of the good-samaritain \nvariety. I find her wallet, open it, and pull out her license from a little pocket with a \nclear plastic window. God...this woman's so drop dead gorgeous even her license photo looks \nlike a Playboy gatefold. Like most people, mine resembles an unshaven troglodyte thats been \nbeaten by a bevy of ugly sticks. Her address is on 43rd. Not far from here. I return her \nlicense back into its clear plastic pocket and open the sleeve where her paper money should \nbe. Jesus....there must be over twenty G's here! All in thousand dollar bills! Wow...\nbeautiful and rich. I just struck oil, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n\tI close up her wallet and slip it into my coat pocket. I'm not stealin' it, mind \nyou, just making sure that much money and her address stays close to me. I resume my \ninvasion of her privacy and come across an old wooden box about the size of my hand at the \nbottom of her purse. The top of the box is intricately craved with little skeletons \nintertwined in an orgy of death. Interesting. I pull at the top to open it and the lid comes\nfree with a hiss of escaping air. What the hell! Inside the box, resting on red velvet, is \na mummified hand holding an ornate key carved from bone. Gold in elaborate designs is \ninlaid throughout the length of the key. When I try to remove the key from the grisly hand \nit doesn't budge. Behind me, the bell above the door announces another patron to Joe's fine \nestablishment.\n\n\tWhile I'm intently studying the key someone sits between me and the bum. God...this \nguy smells even worse than the bum. I look at my new neighbor and I'm mildly surprised to \nsee that every inch of him is completely covered with dirty black cloth, even his hands \nand face. The only openings in his shroud are two eye slits. If he had a sickle I'd swear \nhe was the grim reaper.\n\n\tI'm about to move down a couple of seats to escape the stench when the \"Reaper\" \ncroaks in a voice from beyond the grave, \"The key. Give it to me\", and grabs my wrist \nholding the box with its treasure. I try to snatch my hand back, but his grip is like a \nsteel vice. I think I hear a slight cracking noise emitting from my wrist and the shooting \npain confirms my first impression. Trying to not let on that he's starting to hurt me, I \nboldly state, \"Get your own key, Elephant Man\".\n\n\t\"It is my key\", rasps the \"Reaper\", and snatches the box out of my hand before I \ncan even react. Once he has the box, he's up and heading for the door. God, this guy moves \nlike greased lightning! Before I'm even off my stool, he's out the door.\n\n\tI crash through the coffee shop door and just catch a glimpse of a black shroud \nrounding the corner into the alleyway next to Joe's. I sprint around the corner and almost \nrun headlong into the \"Reaper\". He's bent over the box, staring into its interior which is \nglowing an other-worldly green. I try to sieze the box back, but the \"Reaper\" backhands me \nacross the face sending me flying into a pile of trash bags. Damn, that hurt! I jump up and \nleap at big n' ugly. I mean to slug the guy in the kisser, but end up missing when he \nducks. My errant fist catches on some of the fabric of his hood and yanks it from his head. \nThe \"Reaper\" looks up at me with eyes smouldering rage. I'm totally stunned and stammer, \n\"You! It can't be you. Not you....\"\n********************************************************************************************\nCheck out Bobby Duncanson's Plan File for the next exciting chapter....

The name of the map is Vanguard Spectacle, \nyou can download the map at:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Alley/6181/Vanguard.zip.\n\nA bunch of the guys here at ION have been playing it, and\nthey really like it.  I enjoy playing the level as well. so \ngrab it, check it out and let me know what you think. It\nis a deathmatch only map so find some friends to play.\n\nGetting ready for thanksgiving so I will be gone from Weds - Sun, so I'm \nlooking forward to visiting with the family.  Anachronox is looking great.\nThe level design team has started on a new group of levels which\nwe are all excited about building.  Tom, Rich and I have been talking\nabout going on the 3d Alpha Anachronox chat once a week to chat \nwith people in the community who want to talk about the game, so \nwe will try to get that coordinated so we can talk about stuff.\nWell enough for now.....\n\nRemember....

Those of us here on Team Anachronox are very proud\nthat Iikka will be joining us as a level designer.  \nTexturing for the city of Anachronox is coming\nalong great, also we are starting to see some very cool\nmodels.

I couldn't ask for a better work atmosphere.\nWe have got some really cool levels going, Zdim's levels all rock \nand Cleaner's stuff is awesome as well.

It has been a long time since you have heard from\nme by way of my .plan file.  In fact it has been almost 2 years.  \n\nI had to come out of hiding to tell you about the down right fun I have had for the past \ncouple days playing Daikatana.  We have been playtesting all of the aspects of the game.  \nAll of the elements were great fun, we played alot of coop, and laughing our a**es off because of the fun nature of the game. Coop gets a huge thumbs up from me.  Yesterday we also tested the different \nepisodes in the deathmatch levels back to back, and it is amazing fun to experience the differences\nbetween them.  The single player is tuning up very rapidly and is fast and furious.  We have\nthe CTF pretty much nailed down with 4 CTF maps, one from each episode.  There will also be a\nDeathtag map included for those of you familiar with \"DOOM deathtag\".\nLots of goodies to keep you involved for hours.  This game is going to be fun for all of you \navid gamers, as well as people who just like to spend a few hours killing time.  We have all\nbeen putting many hours of tiring work to get this thing out to you guys as soon as we can, and \nit is getting close.  There have been many people who, over the length of this project have had a great amount of input to the game and everyone's work shows through.\n\nI beleive Daikatana is going to be one of the great games that people will remember and play for a long time.\n\nI hope you all like it as much as I do.\n\n"}, {"by": "lee@ionstorm.com", "time": 897576900, "contents": "\n*** Ion Storm's Finger Server\n\nUser name: lee\nPlan modified: Thu Jun 11 11:51:28 1998\n\nLee Perry \"eepers\"\nLead Artist, Anachronox\nlee@ionstorm.com * gabnlee@ix.netcom.com\n\nJune 11, 1998\n*************************************************\nI'm not going to give my impressions of E3, largely because if you know enough\nto locate this plan file, I'm sure you've had more than your share of wrap-ups.\nI did get to see the Final Fantasy 8 demo in the back of the booth though,\nand it was damn sharp.  Later someone sent me the video I saw there, so I've\nbeen staring at it a while now.  Good luck to my buddies Joe Black, who's just\nleaving Square to work at Westwood, and Nick and Kseniya Hoppe, who are out\nof Square to work at Digital Domain on superno... oh, I'm not supposed to\nknow that, nevermind.  Also Tin Chung, lucky bastard who worked with Moebius!\n\nAnox was recieved very well at E3, especially since we showed it to a handful\nof press people behind closed doors and left them to make their own decisions\nof what they thought of the title so far.  Anyone who gives me the \"ION is\nover-hyping Anox\" line can smooch my lily white hiney, all showings were private\nand any and all press recieved had nothing to do with us \"hyping\" it up. The title\nis excellent so far, and it's merits speak for themselves.  Thanks for all you\nlate workers for bangin that bad-boy out.\n\nWe're down to only about 50 creatures left to model! Yipee! Can't\nwait to have a facet of the game actually \"completed\" so early, barring\nrevisions later of course.  Anyway, catch you guys later, back to modeling!\n\n\nMay 14, 1998\n*************************************************\nHey guys and gals, if any of you are (or know anyone who is) looking for an\nanimation position let me know.  Anox could use another after we've\nstarted the process of expanding our animations considerably in the game.\nWe're using Lightwave by the way, but any package can be utilized if the\nskills are there...\n\nsend any questions or info to me (lee@ionstorm.com) as soon as possible.\n\nThanks!\n\n\nFebruary 10, 1998\n*************************************************\nHey all you Quake2ers out there! I've wrapped up Rectangular Death (rec.bsp) and\nit is ready to be painted with fresh layers of organic matter! It's an arena\nbest played with 3 to 6 players (6 is frantic enough, more is just loony!).\n\nIt can be downloaded at:\nftp://cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/quake2/levels/deathmatch/p-r/rec.zip\n\n(might take an hour or two to update, check back if it's not there)\n\nenjoy! And watch those grenades!\n\n\n\nFebruary 5,1998\n*************************************************\nHappy birthday/year (?) for all you 23/35 year olds in the Year of the Tiger!!\n\nWell, We are in fact in the super-cool (really, it's DAMN cold) penthouse now of\nthe Texas Commerce Bank Building (or chase or whatever the hell it is this week).\nThe Space is really rockin, but it needs some work on a few issues of great\nimportance such as glare on screens, temperature, and a few people seem to be\nbugged by the noise level and the accoustics of the joint.  Other than that it is\nan absolute palace and I'm damned glad to be here!\n\nI've worked my new deathmatch map (hehe... RECTANGULAR DEATH) to about a 97% complete\nlevel.  If any of you were really big fans of Circular death you should REALLY enjoy\nthis one as well.  E-mail me and I'll send it to you for you to give me a bit of\nfeedback on.  Also is a new version of Cir called Dual Circular Death specifically\nintended for capture the flag, team play, and larger player number deathmatches.\n\nA note about my design of the arena series I call \"geometric death\":  I love many\nmany complex maps, and I applaud good ones to no end.  The arena maps I've made are\nspecifically designed for when you've got 2-5 players in a game and are a bit tired\nof maps where you run through HUGE areas and can't find anyone to combat enough to\nfeel like you're playing an action game.  Also, I give this series a specifically\nsimple and usually symetrical geometry in an effort to limit the advantage people\ntend to weild when they know a complex map like the back of their hand and wipe\nnewby ass everytime they play it.  I like to emphasize the actual gameplay over the\nact of memorizing a map.  A lot of people might like a break from corridor hunting\nand get down to a frantic-as-hell death shootout, and not everyone has 16 players\naround to game at any one time.  I hope these maps fill a bit of that void, and I\nhope people above all enjoy a more \"leveled\" playing field now and then.\n\nI love good map designs and I'm still very very new to it (with tons to learn) so\nif you've got cool ideas lemme know and I might be able to incorporate it in an\narena in the future...\n\nCircular Death can be found here:\nftp://cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/quake2/levels/deathmatch/a-c/cir.zip\n(and rectangular death should be finalized by Friday...)\n\nI also picked up Final Fantasy Tactics this weekend, coming from an ex-square artist\nlet me just say \"HOLY SH*T\" I love the art style of the characters in this game.\nSquare once again pulled off a beauty and for anyone who enjoyed Vandal Hearts on\nthe PSX (but might of thought it too easy) will surely enjoy the hell out of\nFFTactics... buy it, play it, rent it!  BUT IT'S STILL ABSOLUTELY NOTHING COMPARED\nTO XENOGEARS!!! We have GOT to get this RPG state-side, best damn RPG engine yet\nand a truely fantastic game, simply amazing...\n\nMany of my old friends at Square are shoving off to the Honolulu office this week\nto work on a certain project I turned down to come to the Anachronox team. The project\nis unannounced but let's just say it's a very well known series from Square and it\ncomes with a number greater than 7 after it.  I wish you gus well, say hey to Akata\nfor me!\n\nOn the Anachronox side.  We've cranked out another 45 characters last month for\nAnox and are already more or less through the 40 for this month's deadline.  I'm\nVERY pleased with how they're coming along and can't wait for the HUGE amount of\nassets in this title to get to the public.  Still no screenshots available so knock\noff all that begging.  We've got a real treat in the works here, be patient, you\ndon't want this title half-baked I assure you.\n\nLater for now!\n\n\nJanuary 1, 1998\n*************************************************\nWell, I've got some funky ideas for a few deathmatch levels to kick out since I've\ncaught a serious case of the level making bug.  My first map ever is named circular\ndeath (cir.bsp) and is available at:\n\nftp://cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/quake2/levels/deathmatch/a-c/cir.zip\n\nI'd love to hear any feedback from people, bearing in mind it's quite a different feel\nthan most maps have and you really need to play it with several people to really crank\ninto it. Enjoy!\n\nAlso, GO SEE TITANIC!!!\n\nDecember 11, 1997\n*************************************************\nAnyone unfamiliar with an RPG from Square called Xenogears, it's a PSX RPG and I know from\nseeing it running while I was working there that it's a work of art that makes FFVII look\npretty stagnant.  Anyway they're not too hip on the importing Idea because it's got some\n\"questionable religous material\" in it.  Yeah well, I couldn't care less, it's not as\nif games with slightly out of bounds material don't do well over here.  I know if I had\nto clear every game I play with a Southern Baptist preacher I'd have a damned boring\narray of games about now.\n\nAnyway, if you care about sending a message that we want more great imports, I implore\nanyone who reads this (and anyone you might forward it to) to go and sign this psuedo\npetition Square has set up in order to get feedback on this issue.\n\nhttp://www.square.net/\n\nThanks, and believe me, if it gets over here you wont regret it.\n\n\n\nDecember 5, 1997\n*************************************************\nJust to reiterate, we are looking for some badass texture and skin people for anachronox!\nCheck out the IonStorm web page under info/jobs and click the anachronox logo for details\nand a group of textures in the game that give something of a cross section of what we're\nlooking for.  Please send Jpegs or Gifs, or just mail them, all the info's on the page.\n\nDecember 4, 1997\n*************************************************\nBeen too long since I've updated.  The team is cranking along as usual, we're going\nthrough a quick change session by getting several of our modelers and texture people\ninto each other's roles.  We've got some really hip creatures in the pipe right now\nI'm working on one of the first (god I hate this term) \"Boss\" characters so it\nshould be a good test of how the engine will handle some huge detail FFVII-ish\neffects and big ass creatures.\n\nWE NEED SKIN & TEXTURE PEOPLE!!!  If you are a competent photoshop type, please feel\nfree to send me a few samples, or if you know anyone who might fit the role do them\na favor and let them know we're looking. My address is (shocker) lee@ionstorm.com.\n3D is not a requirement for the texture positions, assuming you're solid enough to\ncreate render-quality art without 3D.  Give it a shot, what can you lose but a bit\nof your time (and it might lead to something really cool!)\n\nNovember 6, 1997\n*************************************************\nMovie Review: Gattaca\n\nFreakin well done movie in my opinion.  I've been waiting for so long for someone to\ntake a solid story, put it in a sci-fi environment, and let the sci-fi aspects\ntake a back seat to the story, well here it is.  Well concieved, nicely written,\nextremely nice cinemetography and design, and an excellent performance all around by\na well picked cast.  I'm a crtical bastard when it comes to movies and I am hard\npressed to find a serious flaw with this film.  The scenes were a classic almost 40's\nstyle, which lent a nice change to the concept that in a few decades everything is\ngoing to be made out of stainless steel, crome, and neon.  Ethan Hawke, who I've been\nquite down on since a few recent crap trendy grunge-movies, did an excellent job in \nthe lead and made me remember why I thought he did such an excellent job in swing kids\nand dead poets society.  Uma Thurman, who I've never found particularly atractive\n(although I did get to sit next to her at an LA screening of \"Crash\" [dont see it!])\nwas absolutely stunning in the style of this movie, and generally turned my opinion\nof her around 180 degrees.\n\nBottom Line: very solid movie, brings to mind several well written books (such as \nSquirrel and I's favorite \"Ender's Game\" series and the about to be slaughtered\ngreat storyline of Starship Troopers) that I'd like to see this team turn into films.\n\nWell, our demo for Anox is off to Eidos, and was very solid for such an early alpha stage\nin the games production.  I hope to hear solid remarks from Eidos on it upon Jake's\nreturn.  As a gamer I'm looking forward to what this title will accomplish, it's going to\nbe great fun and hopefully a real trendsetter.\n\nNovember 3, 1997\n*************************************************\nDid the wedding thing this weekend with Pmack from Rogue.  My brother's buddy Steve\nmarried my brother's sister (who's not my sister... don't ask, your head will explode)\nso now his best friend is his brother in law... odd.  They had a Karaoke reception, I\nknocked off a killer solo rendition of Elvis's Suspicious Minds, my bro did a bang up\njob with Minnie the Moocher, lot's of fun!\n\nWent to Waco (wee, Davidians everywhere, get em off me!) for the wife's homecoming at \nBaylor.  Some fun to be had there.  Saw an old friend who plays Warhammer 40K a bit,\nand he had just picked up the series of lead miniatures called \"the Sisters of Battle\".\nCheck these out if you get a chance!  Most of them a chicks in powered armor, some with\njet-packs, and they all have a very militant-nun kind of look about them that is hard to\ndescribe, but trust me, they are very hip. They're some of the sharpest figures made for\nthe game in my opinion, and yet another example of Games Workshop's amazing work in\nthe field of non-computer gaming.  It's too bad these guys have a bad reputation with\nmost distributers and shop-keepers, they are an amazing group of talented gamers...\n\nWell, Anox is getting some VERY cool functions emplemented that I can't fully discuss\nright now, but they're definitely some of the things that will make this engine \nusable for our RPG needs.  Catch you guys later!\n \n\nOctober 22, 1997\n*************************************************\nA correspondence with Tom Hall, submitted for your dissapproval:\n\nME: (to our game addicts list) Is Ghost in the shell out yet?\nTOM: The game?  If you're wondering if you missed the film, man, you are BEhind\n  the times\nME: No, I meant the game.  I was wondering cause a few web sites were posting\n  codes, but I was pretty sure it wasn't out yet... odd.\nTOM: The Breakfast Cereal?  (OK, this is where it all just went awry)\nME: No, that was O's in the shell, wait, or was it choco-ghost-in-the-shellula with\n   real mar-Shirow-mallows?\nTOM: Whoops, I meant the Breakfast Serial-- the TV show shown at 7 a.m. Each show ends\n   with some hot robot chick falling through the air slow, saying something dumb about\n   \"the Net\".\nME: What? There's a Saturday morning version?\nTOM: Wait, I meant the Breakfast Serial Bus, which takes early morning downtime to\n   upload.\nME: AARG! I'M SOOO CONFUSED!! There was no bus in Ghost in the shell was there? And\n   I think cyborgs eat Oil-O's for breakfast out of a pan, I might be wrong on that\n   one though.\nTOM: Oh, No, I mean a Break-Faster reel, which allowed a runaway kite to be curtailed\n   Sometimes, the reel could be used with Oil-O's, which is how you can oilpanfish.\n   I think I've gone way off into the area of half-puns, so though I thought my ideas\n   were vast, I found they were half-vast.\nME:  (After realizing the subject was now \"Shows in the gel\") I prefer the patented\n   Popeil Pocket Rocket Fisher Launcher to the reel of which you speak, it makes jerky\n   too and still makes Julian Fries in just nano-seconds!\nTOM: How did you know I just ate jerky?  You are a vision in the chamber, you are the\n   wizard in the keep, you are the... Ghost in the Shell!  Stick a fork in the f**ker\n   it's duuuuuun.  Ah Ron Popeil, Show me again how to spray paint my head\nME:  Slim Jims are just wrong, though they contain lactic acid, something your body\n   needs anyway...\nTOM:  Ever try \"Fat Jims\"? They're really wrong.  Then the \"Way the hell obese jims\"\n   go too far.\n\nAt this point I must break off, Tom revealed the meaning og the universe to me and I\ncan't just go around spouting that off can I?  I'm so confused now...\n \n\nOctober 8, 1997\n*************************************************\nWeekly game update: The Anachronox D&D game has moved to the apartment of Indigo and\nDeadhorse (thanks muchly guys).  Much fun was had Monday night by most of the party\n(those who could actually attack without dropping their weapons).  I'll be running the\nadventure as soon as we finish off the local ruffians, got fun stuff planned!\n\nAnachronox is moving along briskly, workin hard to get everything together by the end\nof the month to show the big wigs at Eidos.  Code is beginning to be merged and we're\nfinally going to start seeing the fruits of all these animations.  I'm really really\nexcited with all the possibilities of our title based on the flexibility of our game.\nI've hardly been able to sleep the past few nights because new ways of implementing\ncool shit just keeps flooding my brain!  Man, this is going to be soooo cool!\n\nOctober 1, 1997\n*************************************************\nD-Day... dum dum duuuuum!\n\nWelp, several people on the team are out of whack with various illnesses (illni?) which\nmakes it a bit more difficult on the Eidos deadline, I can hardly bitch though when I\nwas out last Monday as well and having had several days in the past few weeks where I got\nout of bed, felt like taking the plunger to my nose so I might actually be able to breath\nthrough this Sinus nightmare of Dallas.  Nevertheless there's still quite a few things\nto do, including one of the main characters who is exponentially difficult to animate due\nto a large amount of hair all over his body, so I'm going to let this go and get the hell\nback to animating.\n\nOn a side note the Champions game went well last night even if running later than usual.\nMy little martial artist had quite a fight on his hand taking down an opposing brick with\nrelatively minor injuries in the melee.  The highlight of my evening was my little asian\nkid walking up to the game equivalent of the Hulk with a large sledgehammer and knocking\nthe weapon (which I'm not even strong enough to lift) from his hands.  Of course after\nhe retrieved the tool, the majority of my time was spent dodging my ass off so as not to\nget thumped by it, but it still felt good to overpower a brick with a str 15 character.\n(anyone who plays the heros system can surely empathize)\n\nOne of the construction workers for our upstairs office renovations chatted in the lobby\nwith a few of us about how well everything was going.

Fighting Force looks pretty cool if you're into slug-fest titles as well.\n\nPlayed D&D Sunday at Toms again and basically it amounted to us sitting around for some\n6 hours counting gems (after the guys discovered my handy appraisal skill) and realising\nfor some reason we weren't 1st level anymore!  It was altogether a waste of a playing\nsession, but I did get to roust an old man so it wasn't a total loss of that special brand\nof Lee charcater humor.\n\nLast Tuesday my Champions game ran late supposedly because my bro was \"making maps for the\nadventure\".  The joke came later when we realized quite quickly that all the enemies were\nstrickingly similar to the cast of FFVII and his idea of map research basically came down\nto getting into FFVII and not wanting to stop to play the champs game.\n\nWelp, I'm back on the job, later!\n\n\nSeptember 15, 1997\n********************************************"}, {"by": "leej@3drealms.com", "time": 1024950540, "contents": "Account Name:  leej\nEmail address: leej@finger.3drealms.com\n----------\nIt's About Freaking Time!!!\n\nAfter 19 years, we can finally light this candle...\n\n\n\nUniversity of Texas Baseball is back on top where it belongs.

I found out later that he was putting away the Peruvian Marching Powder, an obvious stage tool for his first ten years.  He also was being divorced by his wife after getting the Latina maid pregnant.  Even worse, his dad had just died.  Again, other than his dad's death, I don't know for sure about the other reasons, but I have never been so dissapointingly suprised as by this chance meeting.\n\n...he did tell me one funny thing, though, that I still remember to this day.  \"Richard\" he said, \"One Levelord beats a Paradox!\"\n\n04/14/199.1\n=================\n\nIt is with great embarrassment that I forgot to mention the \"other\" most hilarious web site on the net...\n\nhttp://www.oldmanmurray.com/seanbaby/\n\n...just read it if you're feeling Blue, ...no wait, ...I mean, it will make you feel up, ...I mean, like, ...when you're down.

I risk alienation by some of my comrads perhaps, for taking sides with Marvin and his bastardly crew, but having been a prime target myself, I feel no shame in this referal.\n\n...how's THAT for gaming news, Chet?!\n\nAlso pointedly related to gaming news, people need to email our esteemed artisan extrordinaire John Mueller (butcher@ritual.com) and get him to finger his Timothy Leary Story (he's not dead, just outside looking in, BTW).\n\n03/02/1999\n=================\n\nShit!  I am really loosing my brains.  It's Mark Chandler, not Rick.  I guess I'm even with them now, though ;)\n\n03/01/1999\n=================\n\nThere should be a law!  When you meet someone who has an identical twin, they should have to tell you so!  I was at GamesCon in Toronto this weekend, ...a very very cool gaming event, ...but we'll get to THAT later.  Anyhow, the fest was organized by Mark Chandler.\n\nI arrived late Frinight and after checking in to the hotel, headed straight for the bar.  I had to taste authentic Canadian beer, ...you know.  Anyhow, I spent a good 3 hours partying with Mark and an assortment of fellow gamers.  One of the conversations was about how we have all met just enough people to start forgetting names and faces when we are re-introduced to people at these sort of events.  The ended well.\n\nThe next morning, I arose early and had a great room-service breakfast before heading down to check on the day's events.  Walking down the hallway, I met Mark.  Except when I said \"Hey, Mark!\", the dude looked at me funny and said \"I'm not Mark!\".\n\nPanic attacked and I got flustered.  I hate not remembering people, fearing the insult it may incur.  The dude looked just like Mark, though!  We chatted for about 5 minutes and then split our ways.\n\nIt wasn't until later that day that I found out that Mark has an identical twin Glen, ....bastards!  They will pay for that, they will pay ;)\n\nThe GamesCon event itself was awesome and is highly recommended (rumors have it that there may be another one later this year).  It was like a QuakeCon and E3 all wrapped into one.  Very well organized, too.\n\n\n\nOn the news wire... ...I recently posted an small snippet on 3DGaming.net about all the gamer bashing that occurred this year.  \n\n     http://www.3dgaming.net/stuff/bitchslap/\n\n...and guess who sent the most emails related to the article?  You bet, the bashers ;)  Seems turn about is NOT in fact fair play.  Oh well...  \n\nSeriously, for those wondering why the piece was written so late, I was busy with SiN and only now can find the time to write about frivolous things.  The motive?  As I said, I love the abuse and welcome more.  Actually, I understand more has already been posted in places(?)  The motive, though, was more for the side-effects and innocent by-standers that get hurt with this shit.  \n\nDid I \"lower\" myself to their realms?  Yes, ...yes indeed ;)\n\n01/15/1999\n=================\n\nShopping on Figuroa... ...I was reminded of another story Dick told me a bit ago, and since there's so much free time lately, I thought I'd share it.  This one took place back in 1986 while he and a childhood friend of his were living in Los Angeles.  \n\nDick was going to school to get a cool engineering degree and his friend, Deter, had just recently moved to LA to take a new engineering job.  This is important because it explains why neither could afford any substantial amount of Californian Salad and had to make weekly trips downtown for their quick, tin foil-wrapped refills.\n\nShopping on Figueroa was usually pretty cool and easy... ...slide up curbside in the auto, wave a hand, and three or more Entrepreneuritos would rush up and trade a small clump of tin-foiled wacky weed in exchange for a mere $10.  However, this one trip, and their last to Figueroa, would prove much more exciting.\n\nDeter was a fairly big dude and was in fairly good shape.  He was also raised in a meager Irish Catholic household with six other siblings.  Translation... ...Deter was not afraid of too much that met him, to the point of being senseless sometimes.\n\nInstead of the usual drive-in service, this last visit to Figueroa started with Deter having to actually get out of the car and walk to the dilapidated building housing the street vendors.  Dick, BTW, was driving his father's fairly new car, as his own Nova had recently blow-up, \u00c2\u0085literally.  Deter proceeding to the house, about 1/2 a block up the street from where Dick was parked.\n\nDick, anticipating a wait, turned on the radio and kicked back with a mule.  No sooner had he lit his cigarette than Deter came running by the car at full speed yelling \"Dick! Dick! Get going!  Now!!!\".  Directly behind Deter followed four homies and they were gaining on Deter fast.\n\nDick, thinking quickly as any good Dick will do, jammed the ignition and floored the Buick out and into the street.  He needed a quick 180 and fortunately there was an empty lot just ahead\u00c2\u0085 \u00c2\u0085unfortunately, Figueroa was a one way street.  No matter, when a friend is in as much need as Deter seemed to be\u00c2\u0085 \u00c2\u0085the adrenaline rushed and Dick pulled into the lot to set up for his daring rescue.  Thanking god that American cars still had read wheel drive, he fish tailed a beautiful half-doughnut, spewing dust and dirt into a big feather-shaped cloud, and got back onto Figueroa in less than a second.  Figueroa was, again thanking all deities, fairly empty of what would be oncoming traffic.\n\nStarksy and Hutching it a block down to Olympic, Dick re-entered correct traffic and he soon caught up to Deter.  The Chinos were fast on him and Deter's left sneaker flew off his foot just as Dick caught up to him.  The Homies were a mere few feet behind Deter by this time.  Dick reached over, frantically opened the passenger door, and yelled for Deter's attention.  Still going a good 5 mph, Deter leaped into the car and Dick floored it to safety.\n\nIt turns out that this whole ordeal was because Deter didn't like the visual quality of the Salad he had bought and wanted his $10 back.  After asking for the refund and being refused, \u00c2\u0085laughed at, actually, he evidently just grabbed the 10 spot from the net stocking-headed hood and ran.  Ten bucks and a clump of horse weed... ...Dick risks his dad's Buick through a half dozen near misses, Deter his very flesh and blood... ...and all for a meager ten bucks!  Not much of a story, I know, but a message just the same\u00c2\u0085 \u00c2\u0085Drugs are badddd, mmmmkay?!\n\n\n01/07/1999\n=================\n\n1999!  ...I get the feeling this is going to be a bad year, ...very bad indeed.\n\nIn case anyone will be in the area, I'm heading for the Great White North on the last weekend in February for the GamesCon Extravagancy (http://www.gamescon.com/page.cfm).  They've asked me to talk about level designing or some shit, but I told them it would be better if I shared my experiences with submarine hunting in the Cold War or cultivating Californian Salad in cold New England.\n\nI can't just leave you with that, though, so here's a little pre-Levelord story.  It's from a time long ago, before I saw the light and became a level designer,  \u00c2\u0085I was a bit jockey, actually.  I am reminded of this story because I just replaced the old `89 Yoter van with a brand new `99 one.  A little tear of times-gone-by welled in my eye as I looked in my new rearview mirror at that old, decrepit van in the used car lot.   What a great car\u00c2\u0085 \u00c2\u0085slammed at 50+ mph into two highway embankments and starts right back up again, three oil changes in 81K miles of driving, 1 "}, {"by": "levelord@ritual.com", "time": 934803720, "contents": "\n*** Ritual Entertainment's Finger Server\n\nUser name: levelord\nPlan modified: Mon Aug 16 08:35:50 1999\n\n08/16/1999\n=================\n\nForgot to mention the best part of that last evening's tail.  Not quite a Dick Story, but it does add the extra \"real life\" edge to my engagement announcement...\n\n...Kelly and I had been in the Bath O' Betrothal for about an hour when all of a sudden a loud pounding came on my front door.  It was 2am and my first thought was \"Shit, the police are here for a Cops bust and they've got the wrong place and by the time they realize it is the wrong place they will have found something to make it the right place and...\", ...like I said, it was 2am and the force behind the knocking was rather strong and alarming.\n\nI went to the door, barely covered by a towel, and found that it was only my downstairs neighbor.  I have never used the tub in my apartment, only the shower.  Evidently, when the tub is full there is enough pressure for the water to leak down through the gasket by the drain.  My neighbor now had gallons of water seeping into her bathroom.  Sure enough, when I got back, the tub was half empty of water.  Kelly and I hadn't noticed, I guess, because of all the swooning and such.\n\n08/13/1999\n=================\n\nPurely personal, so don't email me, Old Man Murray, bitching about non-professional finger flipping!  If this is Brother Tim, please keep your mouth shut about this until Kelly gets home...\n\n...the Levelord, the Good and Humble, the hater of the Dreaded \"We\" Pronoun, ...is officially engaged.  Poor, poor Kelly... ...induced and intoxicated amidst the romance of an enchanted evening of movies, Cosmic Cup dining, and Mr. Bubble, ...said she would spend the rest of her life with me ;)\n\nI really have missed the \"other\" half, and the romance and all, the past five years.  I thought I was satisfied with being alone and free.  No \"we\" pronoun... ...when are \"we\" going out, what are \"we\" going to do this weekend, what are \"we\" going to have for dinner.  I was wrong.  I like being alone, but not lonely.  I was starting to think I'd end up like Aqualung.\n\nI took Kelly out Wednesday night to see \"The Sixth Sense\".  She loves going to the movies, and especially the popcorn.  I made all the manly motions to make her feel catered and caressed... ...running around the car to open her door, holding hands at every opportunity, asking how she was enjoying the evening and if there was anything I could do more... ...the works, and it worked ;)  Remember, I'm 41 now, she's not too far behind, and we've already lived together for 5 years in the early 1980's... ...this isn't just young love ;)  \n\nCool, cool movie, BTW.  I was expecting more horror and scare factor, but the story and acting were very cool.  \n\nAnyways, we then went to the Cosmic Cup for dinner.  This is a great restaurant if you're a vegetarian and especially if you're an ex-hippie.  Great atmosphere and great food.  I had been so nervous for two weeks, knowing that I was going to ask for Kelly's hand, and the movie and dinner seemed to last for days as I wallowed in anticipation.\n\nWe then returned to my, ...errrr, excuse me, ...\"our\" apartment for the finale.  While she watched television, thinking it was the end of a nice, simple-yet-romantic evening, I headed for the bathroom, shut the doors, and proceeded to set the trap.  Two candles, a bottle of Dom Perignon, and a tub full of Mr. Bubble.  We (caught it that time;) have an awesomely commodious Roman bath tube in our apartment... ...extra wide and long, and it comfortably fits two.\n\nOnce readied, I swang open the door that leads to the bedroom and displayed this final feather flurting.  We sat and soaked for a while and I then popped the cork of the champagne.  I filled the two glasses and cautioned Kelly NOT to taste it yet.  Reaching around behind the tub, I grabbed the heirloom (Old English for \"Save the money for the house and sex toys, kids!\") diamond ring and clumsily put it on her finger.  An awesome 1.6-ish carat chunk of condensed carbon, the ring was originally my matriacal Grandmother's.\n\nI can't believe how nervous and awkward I was.  It was like being a teenager again and asking that first girl out for a date.  It wasn't until 30 minutes later that I stopped trembling and stammering.  I had placed the ring on Kelly's finger under the cover of the layer of bubbles and it took her 10 minutes just to gain the courage to lift her hand out of the water to see the ring.\n\n07/08/1999\n=================\n\nThanks again for all the cool, cool email.  I am definitely going to be down for a while.  Actually, I'm a fucking wreck trying to reconcile dad's departure and Kelly being so far away.  I do apologize for long responses and such ;(\n\nIf you want to help the Good and Humble Levelord recoup, go do the right thing and visit http://www.3dgaming.net/ and vote for the appropriate web page ;)\n\nAnyone remember that little \"Guess Who's in the Photo\" thing on Blue's News with me and Robin Williams?  Remember how depressed and distant he looked.  His dad had just died.  Wish I had been more empathetic ;(\n\n06/30/1999\n=================\n\nA sharp, swift sword is a very good thing, and it is bad one! ...just a special note for all the cool emails related to my dad's demise and an apology for not answering them all sooner.\n\nFor those that haven't heard, my dad passed away on June 15 from a sudden and severe stroke.  His death was sharp and swift!  He was at a meeting on Tuesday morning and simply collapsed at 9:30am.  Within 2 hours, he was gone.  Little pain other than the fear and little time to suffer other than a few brief, semi-conscious hours.  That's was good because strokes too often leave behind a partial survivor, crippled and suffering for many years.\n\nIt was also very bad because the departure was indeed so sudden.  My mom, dad and I (my only brother killed himself in 1980 in a fatal motorcycle/beer/telephone pole incident) have always been a very close family and, apart from my loss of weekly phone calls to tell the folks all the cool shit that happened the previous week, I feel a terrible empathetic loneliness for my mom who nows sits at home so completely alone.  43 years of sharing almost everything they did whiped completely off into the blankest blackness, just like that.  It makes me think that I would really rather have never of loved at all, for I never would have cried.\n\nMy mom and I are atheists, devote atheists, so death to us means only that the person has slipped back into the void from which they originally came.  Gone, and gone FOREVER!  Therein lies the true pain.  No happy reunion later in someplace called heaven, just gone and gone forever.  Why is that, BTW, that theists and agnostists find it easy enough to accept that they immerged from nowhere and nothingness at birth, yet they can not accept that that is where they may indeed wind up at death?\n\nAnyways, thanks so much for all the cool emails and please give me another week or so to full recoup.\n\n05/27/1999\n=================\n\nSacr\u00d9\u0089 bleu!  I have been honored as the \"Link of the Day\" on Blue's News?!  Momma, I'm on top of the world!  ... ;)\n\nThere's a new entry on Dick's Place(www.levelord.com/dicks/dicks.htm).  Not quite as exciting as usual because it's about me, but if you're bored, please do check `er out ;)  I don't want to get alot of emails saying \"No way! ...you're making this up as you go along!\" because it is true.\n\n05/26/1999 (cont)\n=================\n\nThanks for all the cool emails wishing me good luck in my new found old love.  The problem is, though, that she's in New Jersey and the Levelord is here in Texas.  Also, POSSLQ stands for People of Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters.\n\n05/26/1999\n=================\n\nAmerica is one fucked-up country!  Don't get me wrong, we do some pretty cool shit over here and I truly love my home, but we are so fucking hung up on sex and nudity that it's amazing we even progenerate at all!\n\nI just had the most wonderful 5-day vacation I've ever had, and now I'm reminded of the American priggish prudeness.  An old girl friend came to visit.  Actually, Kelly Ann is a POSSLQ that I spent alot of time with and had alot of fun with.  Unfortunately, we had so much fun that I believe I'm in love again for the first time in a decade... ...what a drag because I thought all that shit was past me.  That's another story, though.\n\nWe spent the entire time making, ...well, making jigsaw puzzles.  You know, with the interlocking pieces and all.  We even took pictures to remember it all.  Kelly is a fun girl ;)  This is all related to America because I just found out that it's against the law for photo shops to develop any pornographic pictures.  Nudity is okay, but any touching or contact is right out.  They'll develop a decapitation auto accident or murder, but any contact between to loving adults is simply not allowed.  How fucked-up is that?!\n\nThis hits so close game development because we want so badly to put nudity and soft-porn in our games but do not for fear of lossing shelf space.  We can blow-up babies and massacre crowds of innocents, but show even a nipple and we're banished.  For those of you that know what we're doing in FAKK2, please also know the tremendous risk we are taking ;)  ...and I'm moving to Europe the first chance I get!\n\n05/19/1999\n=================\n\nMore from E3...\n\n\"I'm going to KICK Lara Croft's ASS!\" - Julie Strain, May 15, 1999.\n\n   ...nuff said!\n\n05/17/1999\n=================\n\nOnce again, E3 was awesome and E3 was draining.

Okay, I looked-up herniated cervicle disk myself.  I was wondering whether it is usually caused by trauma or wear-and-tear.  I would at first guess trauma, like a sports injury or accident, but we know how much physical activity I see, ...none.  I thought then maybe it's a repeated stress kind of thing, like man-handling a mouse and casting worlds of gore and destruction all day.  Nope, ...it's neither.  80% of this kind of slipped disk is age-related.  I want my money, and I want to find a small island somewhere!\n\nEeee gads!  ...it's Election Day here in the U.S..  First, let it be known that I think it should be a legal obligation for every citizen to vote, ...even if you only go in to cast a null ballot.  I'm not buying that \"I don't keep track of the issues!\" shit.  We were at lunch yesterday, celebrating some new Tribe members and some visiting ones as well, when Mark asked \"Who's voting tomorrow?\".  Three of the twelve hands went up.  Shame, shame, shame!\n\nThe Levelord's Forecast?  ...57% Bush/Cheney and 43% Gore/Lieberman, ...with the standard +/- 17% uncertainty gap, of course.\n\nLike the general public, I am really torn this time.  I like and dislike both major candidates.  I can't say which way I'm finally going, but we can play with the finger, yes?  First, I make a comfortable living and I'm over 40-years old, ...so there's a Republican vote.  However, I also like the last 8 years, things went well, ...and I abhor nepotism, ...even the hint of it.  Finally, I am a registered Independent (for the unfamiliar, that means I'm not a Democrat or a Republican, and I refuse to vote for Ralph Nader).\n\nI do have to consider my vocation.  I mean, I really want to have gore and sex in my games, not Gore and Lieberman.  Don't get me wrong, ...I am for a strong rating system and enforcement, but Hartford Joe seems a little too enthusiastic and grandstanding on the issue.  Lieberman is from Connecticut, but George W. was born in New Haven AND he's a Texan.  Then again, ...George W. was born in New Haven and is a Texan ;)  I'm still not absolutely sure which way I'll go, but I think the Levelord's Forecast will be close, at least personally.\n\nSpeaking of New Haven, ...how about a very small Dick Story.  Actually, I decided last night to fess-up to this one myself.  It's the Year 2000 and I should not be embarrassed about getting beat-up by a girl, especially in the name of love.  This one was going to be called \"The First Time Dick Saw a Pussy.\".\n\nLast week I remembered the first day I saw the female counterpart to my Snow Pen.  It was in 2nd or 3rd grade, ...I can't remember which as these two school years seem to blend together.  I can only remember the teachers as different.  \n\nAnyway, this happened in the playground of the Timothy Dwight Elementary School in New Haven.  The section of town that I lived in was 70% Black, 20% Puerto Rican, and 10% white.  It was also the 1960s.  I only mention those facts to set the atmosphere.  Most of everyone in the immediate neighborhood got together very well.  There was that innocence of youth, too, that didn't really see things like skin, ...over-weightness yes, but skin, no. Also, my step-grandmother is Black (Grandpa married her before I was born, and she was my plain old Grandma as far as I ever knew), so I don't want to hear any PC stuff.  I mean, politally correctedness, ...personal computer stuff is okay, ...I'll hear that, of course.\n\nWhere was I, ...oh yes, ...New Haven was a very rough town and you either learned to fight real well (against typically out-numbering foes), or how to run like a gazelle.  I remember one time climbing up a chain-link fence, on to a single-story garage, across the roof, and leaping the full 12 feet down the other side in order to get away.  I also remember other times looking back over my shoulder to see slower friends get over-taken, tackled, and get the living shit beat out of them.  It was like watching a real-life National Geographic of lions taking down a wildebeest.  It always made me feel guilt-ridden for not going back to help, but like I say, the odds were most often stacked well above any possible recourse other than self-salvation.\n\nThis is all to say that I turned out to be a flyer rather than a fighter.  Not that I wouldn't fight, mind you, I just knew when it was best to run.  This particular school yard encounter was even worse than out-numbering odds, though.  It was an encounter with a pack of classmate girls.  \n\nNow, anyone who has had to deal with this knows it's a no-win situation.  You can't run because that would look like unforgivable cowardly (remember this is all being evaluated with the social values of an 8-9 year old).  You can't fight back because beating up girls was unforgivable, too, even with all the racial tension being used as a mitigating defense.  I pretty much just played limp dummy and let Roberta, Porche, Dianna, Yvone, etc. have at me.  It was really only taunting and pushing, not any physical pain, ...until Cynthia started in.\n\nShe got very physical as the mob-mentality fed on the feast.  After a few shoves, I was on the ground.  I can still remember her smell, and the smell of the sand.  She was a very pretty girl, ...just slightly friendlier than a wet badger, but very pretty. She eventually had me fully pinned on my back with her spread-eagled legs holding my arms down.  She looked down at me, then her crotch, and pulled her panties to one side.  She kept yelling \"Want to see my pussy, whiteboy?!?  ...huh, cracker?!?\".  Although I had been able to maintain internal composure up until the pinning, I was now in deep confusion, fear, and panic.  \n\nWhat the hell was this!?!  Both my parents were artists, and I saw a lot of nude bodies (in the form of \"art\") as a very young child.  I knew the difference between girls and boys, ...but to have one shoved in my face, ...after getting beat-up by a bunch of girls, ...well, it was a time to remember.  It was a time to upgrade my social values, ...and tactics.\n\nWait a minute, should I consider this a rape?  ...a GANG rape?!?  Have I been violated?  ...sorry, that's not funny.  I do regret not being fully aware of real intentions back then.  I now know that Cynthia was probably attracted to the Levelad and he could have had some nifty games of Doctor with her.\n\n11/06/2000\n=================\n\nYes, yes, the BaDmAn is here!  I went to the airport on Saturday to pick him up.  It was hilarious sitting in the International Arrival section.  I caught two different nationalities (thick accent and ethnic garb) saying \"Y'all\".  I know it really isn't anything special and shows my Amero-centric narrow-mindedness, but to hear a Pakistani say \"Y'all made it okay?\" in a real thick accent just floored me.\n\nI got word from the doctor.  The MRI test is back, ...herniated disk between the C6 and C7 vertebrae.  I knew it wasn't just cramps from passing out. I'm never sure, in these situations, whether I want to hear that they found something or not.  Is it better that there is a cause, or that it was some mysterious, probably in your brain kind of thing.  The doctor is suggesting neuro-surgery.  This is the guy that through two medications at me for high blood pressure and cholesterol, and maybe mentioned exercise once and diet never.  The pain is gone and the numbness is almost gone.  I'm staying right here in the office, thank you.\n\nYou know what's really cool about all that above there?  I will get at least a dozen emails with very good advice from people who have had this affliction.  What a cool and connected world!  My recent email about this neck thing hastened a dude from Europe, now living in Australia, who knew two top-notch chiropractors right here in Dallas, ...cool and connected world, it is!\n\nI need to drum-up a Dick Story after all this crying.  Have I done the \"First Time Dick Ever Saw a Pussy.\" Story yet?\n\n11/04/2000\n=================\n\nOkay, okay, so everyone, I mean EVERYONE knows \"Real Genius\".  The question is strengthened, ...why is it NOT on DVD!  ... ;)  \n\nAlso, please stop sending emails suggesting that I find a female counterpart, a Lady of the Levels, so to speak, and procreate!  One nice thing about getting older is that you know more about what you want.  No plants, no pets, no people!  Besides, we don't want this gene pool propagating itself anymore than it has.\n\n11/03/2000\n=================\n\nLike I said, I am very nostalgic and sentimental.  I have always been.

Our goal for mid-April is\nto have drones that can navigate reliably around a world\nthat has a hand-built graph.  What we're working on is \nstill more what should be termed \"skills\" rather \nthan \"AI\" - once a fuller complement of basic skills \nis in place, then we can think about building some \nintelligent behavior out of them.  As mentioned before, \nour drone behavior in Tribes I is pretty limited.  \n\nShould probably clarify - this is not for the Tribes I\npatch (sorry!), rather we're looking down the road.  \n\n\n[2/23/99]\n\nWe've been testing out the drone code implemented for the \nTribes Training missions to make sure it works fine in a \nmulti-player setting (something it _doesn't_ do in the \noriginal 1.0 release), and we have a simple example \"bots \nmod\" we're making available as an illustration of how they \nwork.  Having drones in a multi-player game requires a 1.2 \n(or greater) version of the SERVER, but any client version \ncan join.  \n\nProbably should start off with some expectation management \nhere (bad news first).  The bot \"AI\" is pretty limited: \nthey follow scripted paths and fire at the closest enemy \nthat they have line-of-sight to.  They don't jet, make \nstrategic decisions, or even automatically avoid obstacles, \nor obey commands (other than waypoint commands).  At this \npoint the term \"drone\" is more accurate.  They can be used \nin missions as defensive patrols - running around the \nperimeter of a base for example (which is what the drones \nin the example do).  \n\nA fair amount of control of the drones IS possible from \nscript already and some clever scripting COULD probably \neffect better AI.  The example mod can be used as a \nstarting point, plus a reference doc to the AI console \nfunctions is just about done and will be posted.  \n"}, {"by": "loonyboi@mail.gamespy.com", "time": 897842340, "contents": "User:   loonyboi\nRead:   0\nUnread: 3\nTime:   Sun, 14 Jun 1998 11:38:59 -0700\nPlan:\n6/14\n\nOkay...so i'm bandwagon hopping. Sue me. \n\nI just read this GameCenter article and here's my rundown of reactions.\n\nLet's start with the basics here. Direct3D underrated? Yeah, there's something that we haven't had shoved down our throats for the last few years.  Simple rule: anything from Microsoft can not, by definition, be underrated. \n\nQuake II. Was I disappointed? Not really.  I got what I expected.  Do I agree with whatever that magazine was that said \"the greatest game ever\"?  No, of course not, you morons. \n\nDolby: overrated. Uh huh.  \"3D positional audio simply needs more than two speakers\".  In a word...bullshit.  Positional audio (A3D) was created to simulate multiple channels across two speakers.  That's what it does, and does well.  Is it the same as having a 9 channel cinema DSP system?  Hell no...but for the average joe, it's a hell of a lot better than that lame-o AWE64.\n\nAGP.  Can someone out there who owns an AGP card honestly tell me that it's a disappointment? Please?  I'm sorry, but AGP isn't supposed to part the waters, or anything...it's just a major improvement over PCI.\n\nAnalog Controls: underrated.  MY ASS. This has gotten more press than AGP, Dolby, and certainly lame Star Trek games combined.  The N64 ships with analog, the new PSX packages do as well, and the DreamCast has one built in. \n\nConsidering that of all the online gaming sites, GameCenter is the most shameless when it comes to senseless hype, this whole thing seemed like a desperate plea for attention.  Sorry guys, but when you do what, three, four, separate previews of Daikatana in a year, don't turn around and say the thing is overhyped.

About\na week later he finished a fully integrated remote debugger\nin the Tribes 2 engine, complete with breakpoints, variable\nwatches and mouse-over variable support.  \n\nThere were enough differences in the GUI code to prevent us\nfrom easily including the client side of the debugger\ninto T1, but it was easy to integrate the server\ncode back in.\n\nBelow I've included the debugger protocol - hopefully some\nresourceful programmer out there will whip out a Win32 client\nover the weekend in time for the release next week. :)\n(Note, variable breakpoints aren't implemented in T1.)\n\n// call this in tribes to enable the debugger.\n// debuggerPort is the port the debugger connects to.\n\ndbgSetParams(debuggerPort, debuggerPassword);\n\n// when you connect the debugger sends:\nSENDPASS\\r\\n\n// send across the password followed by a newline\n\n// once connected and authorized, the debugger accepts the following commands\n// all commands should be terminated by \\n or \\r\\n\n// all output is single-line terminated by \\r\\n\n\n// 'CEVAL console line' evaluate the console line\n//    output: none\n// 'BRKVARSET varName passct expr' set a breakpoint on a variable\n//    output: none\n// 'BRKVARCLR varName' clear a variable breakpoint\n//    output: none\n// 'BRKSET file line clear passct expr' set a breakpoint on the file,line\n//        expr must evaluate true 'passct' times for it to break and if 'clear' is true, it\n//        clear the breakpoint when hit\n//    output: none\n// 'BRKCLR file line' clear a breakpoint on the file,line\n//    output: none\n// 'BRKCLRALL' clear all breakpoints\n//    output: none\n// 'CONTINUE' continue execution\n//    output: 'RUNNING'\n// 'STEPIN' run until next statement\n//    output: 'RUNNING'\n// 'STEPOVER' run until next break <= current frame\n//    output: 'RUNNING'\n// 'STEPOUT' run until next break <= current frame - 1\n//    output: 'RUNNING'\n// 'EVAL tag frame expr' evaluate the expr in the console, on the frame'th stack frame\n//    output: 'EVALOUT tag exprResult'\n// 'FILELIST' list script files loaded\n//    output: 'FILELISTOUT file1 file2 file3 file4 ...'\n// 'BREAKLIST file' get a list of breakpoint-able lines in the file\n//    output: 'BREAKLISTOUT file skipBreakPairs skiplinecount breaklinecount skiplinecount breaklinecount ...'\n//\n// other output:\n//\n// when the debugger hits a breakpoint, it lists out:\n// 'BREAK file1 line1 fn1 file2 line2 fn2 file3 line3 fn3 file4 line4 fn4 etc.'\n//       where file1 line1 fn1 ... etc is the current call stack.\n// 'COUT output' output has been echoed to the console\n\n...\n\nAnd special thanks to Diane Lee and Wasif Azmat who sent the Tribes\nteam 5 cases of Mirror Pond Pale Ale... can you say Beta application\naccepted? :)\n\n\n"}, {"by": "mark.frohnmayer@dynamix.com", "time": 989879580, "contents": "Message of the Day:\n\nWelcome to the Dynamix Finger Server!\nbe sure to check out http://www.dynamix.com\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUser Name: mark.frohnmayer     Plan Last Modified: 05/14/2001 16:27:50 PST\n\nReal Name: Mark Frohnmayer\nNickname: Got Milk?\nJob: Totally and Completely Unemployed\nProject: Relaxing\n\nI'm on vacation!

This is a phat full release version.  Q3test may not be out yet, but an ounce of prevention.... Grab it!  http://www.gamespy.com\n\n\nE3:\nIf you don't live in L.A.... you may not know that we're throwing an insane rave/Industry Event at e3 with our brothers and sisters at G.O.D Games.  It's big... and it's open to the public.  I think this is a first - and it's the only event that made sense for us to work with. Throw open the gates to the people that play the games? oh yes......\n\nCheck out the insane line-up of artists and beats at:\nhttp://www.gamespy.com/e3 \nhttp://www.godgames.com/e3/os99.asp\n\nWe're expecting roughly 3,500 (!!!) people on both Friday and Saturday nights.  This isn't a gaming event per se... but I can promise you it will be fun.\n\nTune into #techno in MP3Spy on Tuesday night at 7:00 PST for a chance at some VIP passes and some regular admission passes.\n\nStreet Cred: I was playing broomball (the only sport I play anymore) last night and my friend Joachim Vance who used to run the socal raves list came over to me and said \"Mark, what the hell is going on with GameSpy at the santa monica civic... that's an insane lineup. Did you pull that off? GreenGalactic is doing the promo... they know their shit. YOU GOTTA GET ME A PASS.\"   He's a new dad... so he never goes out. Hilarious!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5/7/99  11:26 PM In The Matrix\n\nThe team here launched a great new site this week: fileplanet.com (version 1.0)\n\nThe concept behind fileplanet is pretty cool: We catalog files at all the major file sites, including our own ftp servers and then allow you to full text search or browse the file hierarchy.\n\nFileplanet.com is what I always wanted in a file download site. A search engine, massive libraries, easy sorting and cool statistics for data freaks like me.  Sometime next week we'll have somewhere between 10 and 20 mb/sec of bandwidth devoted to the ftp server (we're at 7 or so now). \n\nIf you have time, check it out and let me know whatcha think.... and check back as we grow the existing libraries and add more games.\n\n\n\n4/19/99 12:28 PM GameSpy Central Time (It's getting hot here!)\n\nMP3Spy got the 5 golden cows - \nhttp://tucows.tierranet.com/mp395.html\nAs my friend Dakkon would say \"RoX0rs Mc0wNage\"\n\nWe held a registration party for The Beatdown friday night using MP3Spy.  Really fun stuff - and should be a killer Beatdown this weekend with all the pent up angst!\n\nAnd I just had to say it:\nThe only thing I really hate throwing away is keys.  At one point I literally had a bucket of old keys, and I kept thinking, but if I throw one away... what if suddenly I can't open (insert some vital door or lock or something) when I need to because (insert life threatening issue here)? \n\nSo I threw some keys away this weekend when cleaning out my desk. It's still bugging me.\n\n\n\n4/16/99 1:00 pm GameSpy Central Time (Finally SUNNY Newport Beach)\n\nHere's a quick tip: We have an office cat here at GameSpy (we call him Stevens, - VP of Nappy Time).  Stevens used to spend a lot of time sleeping in chairs around the office.  I found this unsatisfying, so I setup a reasonably warm desk lamp on my desk.  Stevens now spends his days on my desk under the lamp. Visitors to the office seem to think that this is quite p1mp.\n\nYou can see a picture of Stevens here: http://www.thecomputermechanics.com/gamespy/gamespy.html\n\n\n\n4/12/99  12:10 am GameSpy Central Time (but i live somewhere on the net)\n\nWe released MP3Spy 1.0 this weekend and it's PHAT CITY and crt is the MAYOR.  MP3Spy is a great little program that is the result of our partnership with NullSoft (the guys and girls that make WinAmp and ShoutCast), and so far everyone, EVEN MIKE WILSON seems to like it.  If you like music GET MP3Spy NOW.\n\nCheck it out at http://www.mp3spy.com\n\nBeatDown approaching ... April 24th, 25th & 26th. Check the website at planetquake.com/beatdown sometime tomorrow when the new website is posted.  My bet is that TFC will be played extensively as that's pretty much all we've been playing for the past month.  Although if there were a kingpin multiplayer demo.....  The TF guys came to the beatdown a while back.. sure wish they'd come again... hint hint.\n\nI went to Electronic Arts in Redwood City on friday and hung out in the l33test conference room I've ever been in.  It defies explanation.  If you get up there ask to meet in either \"Eeenie\", \"Meenie\" or \"Moe\" and don't forget to play with the electronic shades whilst jacking in to the net and ripping into the studio quality sound system and 55\" (at least) T.V. And the cookies are good too.  Cool people with really cool shit to play with.  The whole campus is awe inspiring.  Someday..... nah. \n\nMP3Spy... Would you like fries with that?  \n\n\n2/9/99  10:45 pm GameSpy Central Time (Newport Beach, CA)\n\nGameSpy 2.08 (registered only) is out and has a significant upgrade to the SmartSpy Lists:  They are *much* smaller than their predecessors.  So, what does this mean?  Well... let's say you're querying for the Action Quake2 Servers.  The SmartSpy server 1.0 sent you... oh, about 30k of data.  Now it sends you 1k.   Prior to SmartSpy you would query, oh.... about 2000 servers. Now you query just the 160 AQ servers.  If you're a registered user, grab this sucker!\n\nTwo new games were added: Redline from Beyond Games (published by Accolade) and Tribes from Dynamix.  We're getting a lot of email about Tribes...  it's building a really strong following.   Redline is getting raves from the GameSpy email list, so hurry up and check out the demo!\n\nAnd MP3Spy 1.0 is coming.... *soon*.\n\n"}, {"by": "markd@ritual.com", "time": 934823400, "contents": "\n*** Ritual Entertainment's Finger Server\n\nUser name: markd\nPlan modified: Mon Aug 16 13:59:40 1999\n\n08/16/99\n========\n\nSin Version 1.06\n================\n\nVersion 1.06 is out the door and can be found on www.ritualistic.com.  For\nthose of you who already have version 1.05, you should use the 1.04->1.06\npatch.  The difference betwen the 1.05->1.06 and the 1.04->1.06 was less than\n10k and since they were functionally equivalent, I decided to release just the\none patch.\n\nThe new version includes a new deathmatch map from Zor called Spool as well as\nspeech synthesis support.\n\n07/26/99\n========\n\nSINCTF News\n===========\n\nI fixed the invisibility bug (I think) in Sin.

Thats currently in the hands of scott pultz and i should be seeing them in game later today ... also completly revamped the in-game status screens/frag bar so it matched the updated menu system. Mr. mattingly has it all but done and im pretty happy with it. Now to just wait for internal reaction to it, and see how it goes. \n\nI have also been working on one of the audio tracks for the game and Guy is working his mixin' magic on it as we speak. I was completly floored when he asked me to do a track and its been a true labor of love. You learn soooooo much when you have to work within a set way of doing things. It sorta forces you to solve problems you would have just ignored if it was left all up to you. Im pretty happy with the results. Its not eactly what i was hearing in my head ... but in some ways it exceeds the ideas i was originally shooting for. Expect the un-expected ...\n\nand last but not least ... i cant explain to anyone outside of monolith how utterly awesome it is to work in an environment like this ... from the shear adrenelin soaking through craig's wall over to mine to the abilty to work on such a monstrous array of different things ... i get paid to  expand things which i would consider my hobbies, and take them to a new level of competency and coolness.

I don't know what yet, but consider it a small box of random goodies.\n\nSo far it's been 35 days since my first call.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMy Adventures In DSL Land\n\n\n\n\nStarring:\n\n\n\n\n- Me\n- Speakeasy.net\n- and COVAD\n\n\n\n\nA little over a month ago, I decided to get DSL.  I did my homework, checked ratings, websites and asked around to find a \n\ngood DSL provider that wouldn't let me down.  After much consideration, I decided on Speakeasy.  Afterall, they were rated \n\nthird for DSL providers in the nation and some friends of mine had very good things to say about them.  After checking out \n\nthier website, I made the plunge on September 4th and called them.  Here begins my story....\n\n\n\n\nEnter Bob.  My personal service rep that was intent on getting me hooked up with DSL and being a nice guy in the process.  \n\nBob was very helpful and answered all of my questions I could think of.  How long it would take, issues with the distance from \n\nthe CO, whether it matters or not if my name wasn't the name on the phone bill (this is important later), etc, etc.  After all \n\nwas said and done, the order was placed and I hung up the phone excited to soon be getting Speakasy DSL, the third rated DSL \n\nprovider in the nation.\n\n\n\n\nSpeakeasy has this nifty, 'Up to the Minute' status report of your order on thier website.  Anxiously, I checked it every \n\nday from my office to see how much progress has been made.  Each day a new thing happened and it made me feel good to be 'in \n\nthe loop'.  On the third day, all of a sudden, 'Your order has been cancelled' shows up in the list.  Along side that, it says \n\nthat a service rep will contact you shortly to explain to you why your order has been cancelled.  So, not wanting to jump the \n\ngun, I wait the whole next day for a phone call or email.  Nothing.  So, not able to wait any longer, I call Bob, my service \n\nrep handling my order.  \n\n\n\n\n'Bob,' I say, 'My order has been cancelled, what happened?.'\n'It has?,' says Bob, 'Oh no.'\n\n\n\n\nThe next part of the conversation consisted of him explaining to me that because it was a newly installed phone line, COVAD \n\n(who runs the lines) may have submitted it before the phone company could post it.  Then Bob says, 'So we will just resubmit \n\nthe order.....oh, by the way, what phone company are you with?'\nAnd i say, 'AT&T, why?'\n'Oh, we won't go through them...'  Long pause.  Information that I could have used YESTERDAY, Bob!\n\n\n\n\nSo after grilling him for information yet again, We come to the conclusion that I need to change phone carriers to qualify \n\nfor Speakeasy DSL.  I had just ordered this phone line a week prior, so within two weeks, I'm paying two setup fees and two \n\nintial bills for a phone I never ever use just to get DSL.  Four days later, I get hooked up with a more suitable phone company \n\nand call Bob back to replace the order.\n\n\n\n\nGreat!  We hit a bump, but we are back on track now and I will be getting DSL soon!  Bob replaces the order and again, I \n\nwait anxiously checking thier website for the 'Up to the Minute' status.  Three days later, I see the message: 'Order has been \n\ncancelled due to the customers name not matching the name on the phone bill.'  I'm paraphrasing here, but simply, Bob entered \n\nmy name this time around even though it wasn't my name the first time and we had talked about it this same very issue in our \n\nfirst conversation (see a few paragraphs up).  Whoopie!\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, I call thier general sales department and explain to them my hardships.  Two attempts to get a DSL line and \n\ntwo failures.  The person I am talking to now is Joe.  Joe says that he can replace the order under him (they work on \n\ncommision) if I would like to do that.  I of course, say yes not caring who gets the sale, I just want my DSL.\n\n\n\n\nSO!  My account was now started again by Joe and I am back to square one.  Round and round we go and I am back to checking \n\nthe 'oh so wonderful' 'Up to the Minute' status page.  First day I check, the page tells me that 'No DSL order is assosiated \n\nwith this account'.  Ok, no big deal, Joe hadn't put it through yet.  I'm patient, I can wait.\n\n\n\n\nDay two:  same.\nDay three:  same.\nDay Four:  I'm getting worried, so I call Joe on the phone.  He's not at his desk, so I leave him a message explaining to \n\nhim what the website says about my order and I hope that it was a mistake.  I was extremely polite because they had been super \n\npolite to me so far and felt no reason to be angry.  Although, my ears were steaming a bit.\n\n\n\n\nTwenty minutes later, magically before my very eyes, the order goes through.  It seems Joe got my message!  Too bad he \n\ndidn't call me back or send me an email explaining that the order sisn't go though because his dog ate his computer or his hand \n\nwas chopped off in a boating accident or something.  I would have believed him....\n\n\n\n\nSo here we are.  It's September 17th, thirteen days after I initially made my first phone call to the third rated DSL \n\nprovider in the nation.  My order finally goes through....\n\n\n\n\n-cue music-  HALLELUJAH!  \n\n\n\n\nFinally, I get to the point where it seems every T has been crossed and every I dotted.  On September 25th, they send out my \n\nmodem via UPS. It arrives September 30th.\n\n\n\n\nAs a little bit of excitement still exists inside of me despite the Hell I have been experiencing thus far, I set up the \n\nmodem and wait five minutes (like it says in the instructions).  No green light.  WHERE'S the fucking green light mother \n\nfucker?!  A few hours (and a few broken household items) later, I call the third rated DSL provider in the nation, \n\nSpeakeasy.net.\n\n\n\n\n'Oh Sir, I'm sorry, your line wasn't scheduled to be actiavted until tomorrow.'  Well fuck me.  \n\n\n\n\nGuess what friends.  Today (October 2nd) IS tomorrow and my line has not yet been activated.  Again, I call speakasy for \n\nsome answers.  The friendly person on the other line tells me that apparently COVAD has dropped the ball and not activated my \n\nline when they were supposed to (APPARENTLY!).  \n\n\n\n\n'What can you do?,' I ask.\n'Well I submit a 'Trouble Ticket' to COVAD and hope that they see it and it gets worked out,' she says.\n'How long will that take?' I say.\n'Up to 48 hours....' she says.\n\n\n\n\nAnd this is where I am right now.  It will be a full month for me on Friday while I watch a few of my friends get great DSL \n\nservice from places like Yahoo and a fricking Digital Satilite place in about 4 days.  4 fucking days!!  Third Rated, my \n\nass....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** - Personal names of the individuals I spoke to have been changed.  After all, it's not ALL thier fault.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"by": "mbaldwin@legendent.com", "time": 1054060140, "contents": "Mike Baldwin\nProject: Whatever\nPosition: General-purpose Biatch\n\n\n5/27/03\n\nDoctors are getting to be pretty adept at giving out prescriptions.

It really is wood! \n\nI have responded to all of the job inquiries that were directed my way. If you sent in\nsome material and haven't received a response yet, it didn't make it-- I am sorry-- please\nresend.\n\nMeanwhile, now that I have started up a finger, I have received an overwhelming number of \nemails. If you are one of my myriad of fans, please be patient as I intend on answering\nall. I should be getting back to both of you shortly.\n\nAs always, I await those applications from the next super developers.\n\n\n\n----- Looking for a job? -----\n\nAlthough we currently are not actively looking to fill any specific position, I am always\nlooking for talented individuals that are inspired to develop games. If you are such an\nindividual, there are a few things you could do that would make my job a ton easier, and\nyour chances a lot stronger.\n\n-----\n\nFirst, if you are a programmer -->\n\nSupply me with a sample of what you can do using the same tools that we use. Add a new\nspell effect to one of our games, or to Quake II. Create a new weapon. Program some new\nAI for an existing monster, or create your own. Show me that you can work creatively \nwithin the code base.\n\n--or--\n\nIf you have written a game on your own, send a working version to me (with instructions).\nThe more applicable to what we do the better. This demonstrates that you have\nworked through all the problems you encountered along the way. However, a \nTetris clone isn't as powerful a persuant as a Quake clone would be.\n\n--and--\n\nPlease supply me with a resume. I would recognize a few names, but not many. (Exceptions:\nIf John Carmack or Tim Sweeney want to apply, I will forego the demo and resume ;)\nI can better judge your abilities by knowing what you have done. A good cover letter is \nalso helpful. Maybe you have never had a job, but have been coding games since you were\nout of diapers. I would like to know.\n\n--and--\n\nPlease include any salary expectations. If you want lead programmer pay, I need to see\ncapabilities that justify the salary. This alone can help me determine if we have a\npossible fit that both sides can be happy with.\n\n-----\n\nIf you are a designer -->\n\nPlease send your information to Eric Biessman. Eric would like to see a Quake II level\ndesigned by you for single player. I'm told there's a lot more to making a good single player\nlevel than a fun deathmatch or capture the flag level. So go for it.\n\n-----\n\nIf you are an artist -->\n\nBrian Pelletier is your man.\n\n----\n\nIf you are from the sound side of things -->\n\nKevin Schilder is your contact. I think we are in really good shape here though.\n\n-----\n\nAnything else -->\n\nIt's me! \n\nWe do not have producer type positions. \nWe do not have positions for people that have a new game idea. \n     Sorry, we already have more ideas than capacity to produce them.\nWe do not have positions for game testers.\n\nIn general, the positions we do have are artists, level designers, and game programmers. There\nalso are a couple of sound gurus, a receptionist, a project administrator, a director of product\ndevelopment (me), and our two founders (these positions are filled).\n\n----- Waiting for a reply? -----\n\nFor all of you that have sent resumes to me, I will be getting back in touch.\n\nI feel that if you have taken the time to send me your information, I\nhave the time to fairly assess that information to determine whether\nwe have a good mutual fit in our organization. I then will get back to you, albeit\nsometimes somewhat belatedly.\n\nI'm finally starting to get caught up on the paper work that stacked up on my desk. \nWhat that means is those of you who have not yet received a reply should expect one\nshortly.

I have just a couple bits of advice for servers running the map...\n\nFirst: never let sv_maxclients be above 16 (there's only 16 ships available, so the 17th guy's gonna be really annoyed...  )\n\nI've noticed some people running their servers on cable and DSL modems (some not even dedicated or are running a client and server on the same machine). Unless your server has good bandwidth (upload), you should probably set the sv_maxrate to whatever is appropriate for your server. Generally, a sv_maxrate of 6000 is the lowest you can set and still have it be fully playable. Here's a more detailed write-up:\n\nsv_maxrate is the maximum bandwidth the server will send to each client. You can set this low so that clients with low rates (on modems) get the same amount of data as high-speed clients (for fairness, I guess). Since vehicles and this map pretty much requires good bandwidth, and the maximum number of players is 16 (though 8 is probably best), I'm not sure it's much of an issue. The only real thing to beware of is clients who set their rate super-high to try to eat up all your bandwidth! So a high number is recommended. Basically, divide your bandwidth by the max number of players you allow in the map and that's a good sv_maxrate (use the formula below)\n\nA complete description of sv_maxrate:\n\nsv_maxRate - sets the maximum allowable rate a client may have set when connected to the server. The default is 0, which is no limit. A suggested setting is 8000 or 10000 so server bandwidth is not used up by high speed clients, thus allowing modem players to have a smoother game. \nUsage: sv_maxRate <#####>\n\nThe sv_maxrate setting in your server config file determines the maximum connection rate allowed for each client / player. Clients that have a rate higher than the sv_maxrate have their rate capped at the sv_maxrate.\n\nThe higher your rate, the more data that is sent back and forth between the server and the clients. A higher sv_maxrate means a smoother game for clients who have fast internet connections, but the higher the sv_maxrate the higher the bandwidth consumption on ther server.\n\nNote that if a couple of clients were to set their rates to very high values eg 1000000, then they could take all the server bandwidth leaving other players with very little bandwidth, even if they have cable modems! Obviously not good! \n\n\"What should I set the sv_maxrate to?\"\n\nServer admins should set their sv_maxrate to an appropriate value taking into the account the number of clients / players and the bandwidth / connection speed of the server.\n\nMATH \n[Connection Speed] / ([Num Clients] x 8 ) = [sv_maxrate] \n\nSo, in the case of a server with a 256 kbps connection... \n16 players... \n256,000 / (16 x 8 ) = sv_maxrate = 2000 \n10 players... \n256,000 / (10 x 8 ) = sv_maxrate = 3200 \n8 players... \n256,000 / (8 x 8 ) = sv_maxrate = 4000 \n\nJKA will work with sv_maxrate as low as 3000, but it will not be enjoyable for the players. \n\nAnd in the case of a 100mbps server (like servers hosted by Art of War) with... \n20 players... \n100,000,000 / (20 x 8 ) = sv_maxrate = 625000\n16 players... \n100,000,000 / (16 x 8 ) = sv_maxrate = 781250\n10 players... \n100,000,000 / (10 x 8 ) = sv_maxrate = 1250000\n\nThese are ridiculously high, and I have capped the sv_maxrate on our server to 25000, the rate that most clients with cable modems will use.! \n\nNote that the connection is not the only aspect to take into account when determining the number of players to allow on your server. Sometimes the specs of the server are the bottleneck, rather than the connection. A P3-550 server with 256Mb on Linux will hold 10-12 players before it gets choppy."}, {"by": "mgummelt@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 971882220, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Mike Gummelt\nEmail: mgummelt@mail.ravensoft.com\nDescription: Programmer\nProject: Star Trek\nLast Updated: 10/18/2000 11:40:38 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWednesday, October 18, 2000\n\nOkay, time to go off-topic a little bit and dicuss\nvoting.  It seems an alarming number of people are\nnot going to vote, especially younger people.  They\nseem to think that voting doesn't matter or they're\njust too lazy.

They're counting on the cynicism and/or\nlaziness of young people to stop them from voting.  By\n*not* voting for the candidate you believe in, you're\nnot only relinquishing control of your country to those\nwho do vote, but you're virtually voting for the\ncandidate who disagrees with your views.  Everyone has\na say in this election, it can be either passive or active,\nbut every vote not cast has as much impact as every vote\ncast.\n\nWith all this having been said, there's a great website\nthat can help you find who you might want to vote for.\nIf you think you should vote but have no idea where anyone\nstands on anything, this is a great site.

It is every American's duty to vote.\n\n\ncut here:\n8<------------------------------------------------------\n\nTuesday, October 10, 2000\n\nAbout Elite Force load times:\n\nOur guy here who implemented the load/save system and\noptimized it says that all load times on his machine\nare between 10 and 30 seconds.  In fact, Activision had\na strict time limit on the load times- we'd be told to\nfix the level/load code if any level took longer than \na certain amount of time to load (not sure what it was, \nbut it was nowhere near what some people are reporting).\n\nOverall, I haven't heard much about load times, but\na few people on our messageboard and even a couple\nreviewers claim that their loading times have been\nlong.  Sometimes, I suppose, this could be due to having\na fragmented hard drive or other problems, but \noverwhelmingly, these long load times are due lack of RAM\ncausing the hard drive to thrash while loading.  A friend of\nmine had this problem and we tried a few things to fix\nit.  In the end, the problem was he simply didn't have\nenough system/video RAM to run the game at the resolution\nand detail level he was trying to.  If you want to run\nthe game at 1024x768 in 32 bit color with all the detail\nsettings at \"very high\" with high quality sound- you\nbetter have at least 128MB of system RAM and 64MB RAM\non your video card.  Even then, EF by default allocates\n56MB of RAM to loading the map, sounds, models, etc.\n\nShort answer:  If you're having long loading times, you're\npushing your system too hard- drop your resolution/detail\nsettings.\n\n\ncut here:\n8<------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, September 25, 2000\n\nAs many people have been asking about Elite Force\nsource code and tools, here's the status and plans:\n\nWe've released so far:\n\nThe ICARUS Pack:\nAll our original, uncompiled ICARUS scripts.\nibize - the script compiler.\nBehavEd - the graphical script writing tool \n(it will call the ibize.exe to compile the script you write).  \nThis tool should be used to view all our scripts \nas in straight text form they will be unreadable.\n\nThe GUI Pack:\nshaderEd - The tool used to make shader entries.\nmd3view - The tool we used to view our models.\n\nNext we will release the Radiant Pack:\nQ3Radiant (The map editor), the entities def file \nand the textures (some of these are available now I think).\n\nNext, I believe, will be the Holomatch source code for \nthe game, client game and menu DLLs.\n\nI will also talk to James about releasing our external \ndata files (used for NPCs, weapons, items, objectives, \nanimations, animsounds, subtitles, etc.) and a readme.txt \nexplaining how to use them.\n\nI will also release the ICARUS manual when I \nfinish updating it.\n\nAt this time, I do not think we will be releasing \nSingle Player source code.  The game was designed \nso that you can modify it significantly through \nscripting, maps and the external data files- without \nhaving to touch any actual code.\n\nI am going to try to help and support the mod community\nas much as I can.

In fact, Activision had\na strict time limit on the load times- we'd be told to\nfix the level/load code if any level took longer than \na certain amount of time to load (not sure what it was, \nbut it was nowhere near what some people are reporting).\n\nOverall, I haven't heard much about load times, but\na few people on our messageboard and even a couple\nreviewers claim that their loading times have been\nlong.  Sometimes, I suppose, this could be due to having\na fragmented hard drive or other problems, but \noverwhelmingly, these long load times are due lack of RAM\ncausing the hard drive to thrash while loading.  A friend of\nmine had this problem and we tried a few things to fix\nit.  In the end, the problem was he simply didn't have\nenough system/video RAM to run the game at the resolution\nand detail level he was trying to.  If you want to run\nthe game at 1024x768 in 32 bit color with all the detail\nsettings at \"very high\" with high quality sound- you\nbetter have at least 128MB of system RAM and 64MB RAM\non your video card.  Even then, EF by default allocates\n56MB of RAM to loading the map, sounds, models, etc.\n\nShort answer:  If you're having long loading times, you're\npushing your system too hard- drop your resolution/detail\nsettings.\n\n\ncut here:\n8<------------------------------------------------------\n\nMonday, September 25, 2000\n\nAs many people have been asking about Elite Force\nsource code and tools, here's the status and plans:\n\nWe've released so far:\n\nThe ICARUS Pack:\nAll our original, uncompiled ICARUS scripts.\nibize - the script compiler.\nBehavEd - the graphical script writing tool \n(it will call the ibize.exe to compile the script you write).  \nThis tool should be used to view all our scripts \nas in straight text form they will be unreadable.\n\nThe GUI Pack:\nshaderEd - The tool used to make shader entries.\nmd3view - The tool we used to view our models.\n\nNext we will release the Radiant Pack:\nQ3Radiant (The map editor), the entities def file \nand the textures (some of these are available now I think).\n\nNext, I believe, will be the Holomatch source code for \nthe game, client game and menu DLLs.\n\nI will also talk to James about releasing our external \ndata files (used for NPCs, weapons, items, objectives, \nanimations, animsounds, subtitles, etc.) and a readme.txt \nexplaining how to use them.\n\nI will also release the ICARUS manual when I \nfinish updating it.\n\nAt this time, I do not think we will be releasing \nSingle Player source code.  The game was designed \nso that you can modify it significantly through \nscripting, maps and the external data files- without \nhaving to touch any actual code.\n\nI am going to try to help and support the mod community\nas much as I can.

A lot of people were\nimpressed, as we knew they would be, by the snippets\nof TRIBES 2 that were shown. If you didn't see any\nscreenshots or hear any reports of what T2 is like so\nfar, don't fret -- you'll probably be hearing and\nseeing a lot more in the upcoming weeks.\n\n  Whilst the higher-ups were busy unveiling the\ninnovations in LA this last week, dBack and me were\nbusy with something else -- the long-promised (to\nourselves) and long-awaited (by... um, well there\nhas to be someone out there) dBack & Skeet Smack\nPack, or if you prefer, the Skeet/Back Smack Pack.\nIt's been posted on Planet Starsiege already (if\nyou haven't been, http://www.planetstarsiege.com)\nand I just posted it on my old reliable Geocities\npage (http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Dunes/8338).\nIt's more fun than a pocketful of fire ants, and\nslightly less painful than a poke in the eye with\na sharp stick. Check it out!\n\n3/3/99\n\n  Phew.  We got the 1.3 patch out the door, which happens\nto be the first patch that I actually processed. (Tim's\nbeen doing it till now.)  That whole patch-making dealie\nis both simpler and more complicated than I thought --\nfigure that one out.  I'll be the joker cobbling up the\nrelease notes and readme files for the patches now too,\nso you can blame me directly for any and all bits of\nabsolute gibberish.  Please be gentle, I'm not used to\nwriting documentation :)\n\n  I'm starting to get pretty excited about the ideas I've\noverheard about Tribes 2.  (Or is Meddish right, should it\nbe Tribes II?  Or maybe just a different title without\nnumbers at all, like Tribes: Apocalypse?)  Anyone who\nlikes the original is gonna be pretty jazzed about the\nsequel too -- lots of cool stuff.\n\n  I've got lots more on my plate these days -- in addition\nto doing the patches and internal builds, I've got a heap\nof new stuff to learn, like how to be an IRC admin, how to\nremotely upgrade the Combat servers, how to write legible\ndocumentation for tools that I don't entirely understand,\nas well as get more involved in the script-writing and\neventually, coding.  It was nice to have a couple of months\nwhere the pace was a little slower though :)  Oh yeah, and\nthe webpage-based status report that Dave Moore mentioned,\nI'll be responsible for compiling that info too.\n\n  We're gearing up for a tools release soon -- mission\neditor, ZED (interior builder), and graphics-processing\nstuff to get your source art in a form TRIBES can use.\nWith this new release, you'll be able to create your own\nbases and buildings, it'll be much easier to make a new\nterrain for a mission, all sorts of fun.  With the amount\nof new things I've already seen people do just messing\naround with the scripts, it's going to be really impressive\nto see what they can do when they have all the mission-\nbuilding tools at their disposal...\n\n\n2/3/99\n\n I've gotten some great feedback on the crosshair\nstuff I did, and I'm working on making up a bunch\nof new ones based on a few things I learned from\nour resident GUI guy, \"Thulsa Doom\" Tinman. Since\nseveral people e-mailed to ask questions on the\nsubject, I'll share some info with you.\n\n* Crosshair bitmaps can actually be any size or\ndimensions. They don't have to be symmetrical, and\nthey will automatically be centered on the screen.\n* There is nothing you can do to change the big\nblack \"zoomed in\" crosshair except turn it off.\nPress K to bring up the GUI options box, and\nuncheck\tthe \"Sniper Cross\" item. When you zoom in,\nyour \"regular\" crosshair will remain on screen at\nthe normal small size (as opposed to growing to\nfill the screen).\n\n I'm trying to come up with some ideas for some\ninteresting and useful new crosshair designs.\nIf you have any ideas, please leave a guestbook\nentry on the GeoCities page mentioned below --\nI've seen what happened to Scott when he asked\npeople to send suggestions to his normal e-mail\naddress :)\n \n\n2/1/99\n\n For those of you who want a different shaped\nor colored crosshair for Tribes, I cobbled up a\nsmall collection of different ones -- circular,\ntiny dots, etc. in a variety of fashionable colors.\nI'll zip them all up and put them on my old\nGeoCities screen shot page for anyone who's\ninterested -- the URL for that is\nhttp://www.geocities.com/Area51/Dunes/8338\n\n Don't expect much from this page -- I just threw\ntogether some screen shots a couple of months ago\nbefore the game came out, and added some lame\nattempts at funny captions. The link for the zip\nfile should be near the top of the page, above the\nscreen shots. Unfortunately, there isn't any way\nof keeping track of the number of downloads, so if\nyou grab it and find it useful (or have suggestions\nfor new, useful crosshairs), drop me an e-mail if\nyou would be so kind.\n\n The file should be up on the GeoCities page by\n2:00 PM PST today. I'll throw a README in too, but\njust in case you're one of the 95% who don't bother\nto read such files -- unzip the zip file (duh) and\nbrowse thru the BMPs. (I recommend ACDSee) If you\nfind one you like, copy it to your tribes\\base\ndirectory and rename it to H_Reticle.BMP (if you\ndon't do this, your crosshair will not change).\nEnjoy!\n\n Oh yeah, and I almost forgot, happy birthday Mom.\n:)"}, {"by": "mitch.shaw@dynamix.com", "time": 951426540, "contents": "Message of the Day:\n\nWelcome to the Dynamix Finger Server!\nbe sure to check out http://www.dynamix.com\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nUser Name: mitch.shaw     Plan Last Modified: 02/24/2000 15:09:22 PST\n\nWho am I?

You'll be hearing a lot more about him.  Sorry. ;)\n\nFirst, I have a new interview up at PlanetDaikatana.  \nhttp://www.planetdaikatana.com/interviews/mikem-01.shtml\n\nIn this article I failed to mention anything about A3D which caused a flood of\nemail.  We currently do support A3D 1.0.  Soon we will have support for A3D 2.0\nas well.  Anyone with a card that supports A3D, D3D, or EAX and has a set of 4.1\nor 5.1 speakers will have an awesome sound experience!  At the time of the \ninterview I was working strickly with the EAX features of the SoundBlaster Live!\nI now have a test computer with a Live! and one with an MX-300 so I can test\nequally and they both sound great!\n\nMy tasks lately have been: Fixing sound problems in the engine, working on the save\nand load routines, and tweaking monster behaviors and weapons.\n\nWe are showing single player stuff at E3.  Stay tuned.\n\n99.01.28\n--------\n\nGifts in the mail!  Aureal sent us the SDK for A3D 2.0 today.  So that will\nbe my first priority after the DeathMatch demo is done.  They also sent a\nnew Diamond MonsterSound MX300.  Same Vortex chip as the old one, but the\nboard is slightly different.\n\nI'll try and get my surround speakers all setup and test both the Creative\nLabs Live! and the Diamond MonsterSound MX300.  I'm still waiting on Creative\nto send me my new 5.1 speakers ...\n\nDeathMatch demo is looking awesome, you guys are going to love it.  We've\nadded new character animations, new weapon effects, and some other goodies\nfor y'all to play with.\n\n\"THIS GAME IS ROCK HARD.\" - Eric Smith\n\n\n99.01.05\n--------\n\nPolished off the sound code today.  Some of you might be interested to know\nthat Daikatana will be using MP3s for the cinematic audio.  Aren't we just\ntechnology hounds?\n\n3D sound is in and is sounding excellent.  I've tested everything on a Creative\nLabs Sound Blaster Live and its a great card.  I'll be testing on a Diamond \nMonster Sound also, so all you Diamond owners will be covered.\n\nThis rest of this update is rants.  Feel free to ignore me.\n\nI got a Creative Labs Riva TNT card the other day.  For $99 you can't beat\nthis card.  Forsaken looks excellent, Quake/Quake2 just rock, and Half-life\nlooks good as well.  If you are looking for an excellent 2D/3D card at an\nexcellent price go buy one.\n\nAlso, today I got an email from Origin.  Basically they told me to piss off.\nI guess I'm waiting for Everquest now.  Too bad Ion Storm isn't doing an\nonline RPG.\n\n\n99.01.04\n--------\n\nHappy New Year Everyone!  Two years to the millenium!\n\nToday I've got two things and they aren't related to Daikatana or Ion Storm.\n\nFirst, is my bitch.  Ultima Online needs to fix their Player Killer problem.\nThat's all I'm saying for now, but be prepared to hear more about this.  Also,\nfeel free to email and bitch about my opinion on this topic.\n\nSecond, the Diamond Rio kicks much ass!  John bought us all Rio's and they\nare like the greatest things on earth.  (THANKS JOHN!)  The hardest thing\nabout having one is picking out the 8 songs I want to keep on it.  (At 128k\nyou can hold about 8 songs.  At 64k though you can hold 16, thus the 60\nminutes of music.)\n\nHopefully Diamond will make larger memory cards than 16MB.  (And drop the \nprice!)\n\n\n98.12.22\n--------\n\nOkay, I'm here I might as well tell y'all what I'm doing.\n\nSound Engine - I took over all the sound code stuff.  I ripped apart the \noriginal Quake 2 code and made it work with the Miles audio engine.\nIf anyone wants to add sound to any game I highly recommend it.\n(http://radgametools.com). \n\nI am currently in the process of adding some cool 3D audio stuff so\nthat all you people with SB Lives will have a kick ass game to play. \nIf you don't have one yet.  Go buy one.\n\nOther cool things to be added:  \n* Streaming Audio - For cinematic audio streaming off CD\n\nAlso, thanks to me our viewthings now play their sounds with their\nanimations.

It was great to watch the trailer *after* seeing the movie, and realize how all the pieces fit together.  Incredible!  One of the only movies in the past couple years that I'd actually go back to the theater to see.\n\n\n\n1999.03.04\n\nHi All!

Well, it's been a *long* day (since 2/10).  Here's the list!\n\nYou Know You're Working Too Hard When:\n\n- You wake up, and resume typing the sentence that you interrupted when you fell asleep.\n\n- You feel guilty about taking your hands away from the keyboard and mouse -- to eat.\n\n- You feel like you need to stop wasting time -- any time you're away from the computer.\n\n- You hold your shaking arm out to your manager saying, \"After typing continuously for 14 hours a day for the past week, I'm worried that CTS might interfere with my productivity.\"\n\n- Your manager calls you at work to tell you it's time to go home.\n\n- Your manager calls *his* manager to ask him to make sure you leave the office before 10:00pm.\n\n- You lie in bed at night staring at the ceiling, thinking about what you could be working on.\n\n- You look at the leaves on trees in Fall, and wonder how to optimize texture memory usage for all the colors and patterns that it would require to reproduce them in a 3D world.\n\n- When the check comes with the gratuity included in the total, you debate how, in Unreal, you might model automatic computation of the gratuity with a bAutoGratuity flag on the Actor.\n\n- You don't take time to visit the optometrist to get new contacts ...when the ones you're wearing are ten months old ...and they're disposable!\n\n- You're so tired that you don't notice that the frame rate has dropped from 40fps to 5fps due to all the changes you've made ...and, you don't notice because your tired eyes are blinking faster than the redraw.\n\n- The stack of Mountain Dew and Diet Coke cans around your desk has gotten so large that your coworkers can't find you.\n\n- You give up your plans to lobby for a 36 hour day when you realize it still wouldn't be enough if you had to factor in eating, bathing, sleep, etc.\n\n- The only time you're actually grateful for sleep is when you have a dream that helps solve a problem.\n\n- You get your daily 4 hours of sleep in 15 minute increments.\n\n- It becomes a major annoyance that coffee, soda, and high-carbohydrate junk food are not available as IVs.\n\n- This one's just for audio/dialog editors: You start to wonder how to edit out the clicks and pops you hear in your live conversations with people.\n\n- You start actually getting angry at hardware designers for not having developed a direct neural interface...which, of course leads to thoughts on designing one, which leads back to annoyance at the distraction, which leads back to...etc.\n\n- Your workstation routinely runs out of steam before you do.\n\n- You want to go to sleep, but it's time to start another day, and the rest of the house is just waking up.\n\n- You realize that the only thing keeping you awake is the cigarette that's burning it's away through your fingers.\n\n- You start talking to your computer more then to the rest of your family combined.\n\n- You go through the day thinking it's Friday, only to find out it's actually Thursday, but instead of being disappointed because you were ready for the weekend, you're thrilled that you gained an \"extra\" day to get more work done!\n\n- The compile finishes, but, when you open you eyes, you can't remember what you just fixed.\n\n- You get calluses on the palms of your hands from your Microsoft keyboard.\n\n- When you get in late, and you leave early, and you still spend more than 10 hours in the office.\n\n- You look out the window and see the sun on the horizon, so you get ready for bed, only to realize the sun is rising, not setting.\n\nThanks to:\n- Thomas Clark\n- Scott Dalton\n- Andy Frazier\n- Millennium 2002\n- Ryan Ovrevik\n- James Parkman\n\n\n1999.02.10\n\nI've gone for too long without an update.  All sorts of *great* responses have come in regarding \"You know you're working too hard when:\" -- I just haven't had time to catch up.  ...There's bound to be irony somewhere in that statement. :)\n\nHere's my quote for today:\n\"I don't understand the problem, but the solution seems to work well.\"\n\nI'll post the definitive \"You Know You're Working Too Hard When\" list tonight.\n\n\n1999.01.23 5:30pm\n\nOK.  Here's a couple new ones:\n- When you don't take time to visit the optometrist to get new contacts ...when the ones you're wearing are ten months old ...and they're disposable!\n- When you're so tired that you don't notice that the frame rate has dropped from 40fps to 5fps due to all the changes you've made ...and, you don't notice because your tired eyes are blinking faster than the redraw.\n- When the stack of Mountain Dew and Diet Coke cans around your desk has gotten so large that your coworkers can't find you.\n\n(I promise that these are all true -- I'm not making them up! )\n\nKeep the contributions coming -- maybe we can hit 20.\n\n\n1999.01.23\n\nWell, our finger server isn't working so well, but I'll spew anyway, just for the sake of posterity.  We had our weekly \"Friday Night\" dinner last night -- nine of us got together for dinner at the local Lone Star Steakhouse.  Standing outside in the drizzle waiting for a table, we talked about various stuff.  Several comments became the inspiration for what I'll affectionately title:\n\nTen Things That Indicate You're Working Too Hard!\n(in no particular order)\n- When you feel guilty about taking your hands away from the keyboard and mouse -- to eat.\n- When you feel like you need to stop wasting time -- any time you're away from the computer.\n- When you hold your shaking arm out to your manager saying, \"After typing continuously for 14 hours a day for the past week, I'm worried that CTS might interfere with my productivity.\"\n- When your manager calls you at work to tell you it's time to go home.\n- When your manager calls his manager to ask him to make sure you leave the office before 10:00pm.\n- When you lie in bed at night staring at the ceiling, thinking about what you could be working on.\n- When you look at the leaves on trees in Fall, and wonder how to optimize texture memory usage for all the colors and patterns that it would require to reproduce them in a 3D world.\n- When the check comes with the gratuity included in the total, you debate how, in Unreal, you might model automatic computation of the gratuity with a bAutoGratuity flag on the Actor.\n\nOK.  I guess it must not be that bad, I ran out of inspiration before I hit ten. ;)\n\nIf you have experiences that lead to quotes like these, send them to me at mpoesch@legendent.com -- maybe we can finish the list.\n\n\n1999.01.08\n\nYikes!  Over a month since the last update.  I guess it's been a busy month again.\n\nWe're just about ready to switch over to 220 -- this merge has gone *really* smoothly.  I think I've finally got this down to a science.  (Knock on wood!)  With luck, Tim will be able to get the Legend-specific editor mods into the 221 or 222 release.  Keep your fingers crossed.\n\nBy now, you've probably read somewhere else that we've been acquired by GT.  This should be really cool for everyone -- gamers, Legend, and GT alike.  Moving into our new office (an event that is completely unrelated to the acquisition), and losing our T1 line for a couple weeks have been a bigger shock than the transition in ownership! ;)  All the folks we're working with at GT are cool, and have treated Legend's employees with the greatest respect.  A pleasant change from past experiences with this sort of thing.\n\nAs Glen mentioned, we're moving rapidly toward our Alpha target, so the pace is increasing further.  Fortunately, I've been able to delegate many of my technical tasks, and a few of my management responsibilities to other guys on the technical crew (Jim and Ryan).  This has really helped me to improve my focus on managing the technical team, and doing a few things well, instead of doing a crappy job on lots of stuff. ;)  Unfortunately, this means that I'm spending more and more of my life \"managing\" the team, and less and less doing the cool technical stuff.  Hmmmmm.  We're gonna have to work on our approach to future projects.\n\nThe good news is that with the addition of Jess and David and Matthias, we've got a huge group of *REALLY* talented people.  With such rapid growth over the last eight months, it's been a bumpy ride, but we're improving communication throughout the company every day, and building an increasingly solid team.  It's really cool to like *all* the people through the company as co-workers, AND friends. :)\n\nFor all you bouncing off of mpoesch@pdc.legendent.com, you can try mpoesch@legendent.com -- if I don't respond right away, don't take it personally, things are getting more and more hectic.  My bandwidth consumption is running at about 110% of capacity.\n\n\n\n1998.12.07\n\nHow time flies... I actually escaped work long enough to enjoy Thanksgiving.  Watched a bunch of videos, played a few games... not Half-Life.  It's on my Christmas list. ;)\n\nHere's a blast from the past:\n\nDuane was leafing through his piles of paper and came across one that dates back to 1990.  Imagine the era if you can: 5.25\" floppies... ever seen one?   How about one that only holds 360K!  So, the paper he found shows the disk budget for our first game, Spellcasting 101.  We had six 5.25\" floppies, with 360K each.  That's right!  We ended up with a whopping 2,082,139 bytes for the ENTIRE game.  Oh... that included both color (EGA 640x350) graphics and black&white (CGA 640x200).  Without the CGA graphics, the whole game would fit onto a single high density 3.5\" disk. :)\n\nAs I said... how time flies!\n\n\n\n1998.11.25\n\nAhhh.... time to take a break: eat turkey, code a little, hang out, code a little....  OK.  So, I'm not really going to take a break -- I'll probably work 20+ hours on Friday.  But, to misquote (probably) one of the other Unreal licensees (sorry, I can't remember who off hand), \"Hey!  I'm not a workaholic.  I'm a hedonist with a fun job!\"\n\nYes.  It's getting fun again.  Cool mods to the engine and editor, cool features in the game, life getting back to \"normal\" -- only 60 hours/week.   Working at home makes it OK/fun/easy to work long hours.\n\nOnce I get the latest stuff *fully* operational, maybe I'll send Glen a screenshot to post in his weekly update.  For now, I'll have to keep quiet. ;)\n\nHappy Thanksgiving!\n\n\n\n1998.11.19\n\nHey Christina.  I tried to respond to your email to Glen, but your address is bouncing.  If you're still interested, you can contact me at mpoesch@legendent.com\n\nFor everyone else: I handle Legend's recruiting for technical staff.  We're not actively hiring, but if you think you've got what it takes to build great games using the Unreal engine, I'd like to hear from you -- at least until my email box explodes.  I'm totally overloaded, so I may not be able to get back to you for a while.\n\n\n\n1998.11.10\n\nScott summed it up:\n\"Family, friends, and all trappings of your former life must be left behind, for this holy quest is something on which they cannot accompany you. With your new family, you must become one with your mission, for it is all that can save you from damnation.\"\n\nWhat a cool quote!  Somehow, I just don't see DeMarco and Lister shouting, \"Way to go!  You guys really know how to manage!\" ...on the other hand, the fact that we're all taking a certain glee in the insanity of our schedule must be a sign that our team dynamics aren't all bad.  (If you don't recognize DeMarco and Lister, check out the book \"PeopleWare\" -- it's a great book about managing software development teams.  But, I get the feeling they weren't writing about game development!)\n\nIn the final three months of the Mission Critical schedule, all five members of the technical team were working 100+ hour weeks.  I \"won\" the company record with a week of more than 124.5 hours and a \"day\" that lasted more than 36 hours.  (Although, I think our level design team routinely breaks that record these days!)  In any case, when we put the finishing touches on the product, I swore several times that I'd *NEVER* repeat that schedule.\n\nWe're working to strike a balance between the enthusiasm and drive that make a great game, and the long hours that cut into productivity and kill the team.  When Ryan reports that he watched the sun rise from his office -- twice in a row -- I figure we have a bit more balancing to do.  But, it's exciting to be working with such a dedicated and enthusiastic group of people!\n\n\n\n1998.10.16\n\nGot LOD actor mesh lighting operational in 2.5 hours flat last night. :)\n\nIt's really cool to be able to add things like this so easily.  Here are some of the goodies we have:\n- LOD actor mesh lighting\n- SunLights (lights with 10x the normal radius -- great for outdoor environments)\n- Lens Flares (not to be mistaken with Coronas)\n- New BSP optimization code (with enhanced Portal bias)\n- Support for Quake-style climbable textures (prototype)\n- Multiple/dynamic skybox rendering\n- Zone-specific player footstep sounds (prototype for another project)\n- per-Zone occlusion and rendering\n\nEditor features included in 165 build of UnrealEd:\n- Vertex editing\n- Brush/actor selection using via bounding region (the default brush)\n- Brush/actor selection via group name with support for hierarchical semantics\n- Invert brush/actor selection state\n- Render filtering: depth clipping (wireframe only)\n- Render filtering: selected brushes (wireframe only)\n- Render filtering: off\n- Replace selected geometry with default brush\n- Replace selected actors with current class\n\nEditor features included in 216 build of UnrealEd:\n- Vertex editing transformations corrected (scale, rotation, and location)\n- Vertex editing grid-snapping improved (but still kinda flaky)\n- Stretch, scaling, skewing for selected brush(es)\n- \"Transform | Transform permanently\" fully implemented to transform all selected brushes (to recompute vertex locations and remove scale, rotation, and skew factors)\n- \"Reset | Reset Pivot\" for all selected brushes\n- New icon for SnapStretch (formerly SnapScale)\n- AUDIO IMPORT updates to make \"Name=\" parameter optional\n- FONT IMPORT updates to make \"Name=\" parameter optional\n- UnVisi.cpp code modified to move all regions without ZoneInfo actors to Zone 63.\n\nEditor/editing features not in Tim's build:\n- Hardware TexMem metrics (kbytes per frame)\n- Texture specific flat shading in polygon mode (for texture mapping debugging)\n- Player test light to force lightmap recomputation (and updated metrics)\n- Align vertices to grid for selected brushes\n- Scale and stretch selected brushes relative to a common origin\n\nSpecial thanks to Tim Sweeney for building a solid software architecture that made adding these enhancements so simple!\n\n\nHey, check it out!  BitchX finally posted my reply to Mike Dussault -- http://www.gaminginsider.com/\n\n\n1998.10.13\n\nChecking out the Dm3-Unreal.zip mod, I ended up at a site that wasn't exactly\nrelated to Unreal.  I was reminded of one of my favorite quotes:\n\n>...\n>My favorite [hardware] ads are the ones that feature \"videoconferencing.\"  \n>Stop! You're killing me!  I'd bet that for every executive who actually \n>uses that stuff for corporate meetings, there are thousands of guys out \n>there tugging themselves blind.\n>...\n\n- Alex St. John.  boot magazine Jul/Aug 98\n\n\n1998.10.8\n\nI took a minute to check out Dune 2000 on Saturday.  Great ambient music, and cool video -- as usual (I'm a real fan of Westwood's work).  The Dune2 experience brought into the C&C-style engine is a great combination.\n\nThe one thing that left me nonplused was the style (or lack thereof) of the fonts.  I'd be curious to get the inside scoop on why they didn't spend more time on them.  Looking at the interfaces for Red Alert, and now Dune 2000, I've wondered if they used custom controls in MFC.  From Dave Theilan's presentations at the '96 and '97 Game Developer Conferences, it sounded like a pain in the ass to get them to work completely.  Even Enemy Nations (Dave's '97 release) suffered from a few lingering custom control bugs.\n\nSo... I took a look through the Westwood catalog.  Now they have audio CDs for C&C and Red Alert.  :)  In case you haven't heard, I love all kinds of music (pop, rock, classical, movie soundtracks, game soundtracks, and more).  Jason (our GT Producer) got our team Unreal audio CDs.... although he was bummed the last time Ryan and I were out at Epic's office to talk with Tim.  He looked on in chagrin as Tim and Craig loaded us up with all sorts of Unreal goodies.  \"How am I supposed to compete with this?\" he asked in a pained voice.  I consoled Jason by dropping our latest project plan on him -- another 400 hours added to my task list. ;)  Fortunately, things are looking much better this week -- only about 1850 hours to go!  Although I love collecting (and playing) game CDs, they kill my productivity.  Audio CDs, on the other hand, are great for keeping me focused late into the night.  Hint-hint. \n\nNew CDs:\nNatalie Imbruglia, Left of the Middle\nSarah McLachlan, fumbling towards ecstasy\nNirvana, Nevermind\nFaith Hill, Faith\n \nI also want Sheryl Crow, and Shania Twain's new CDs.  hmmm.  Is there a pattern here? :)\n\nMovies watched:\nBorn Yesterday\nSingle White Female\nDouble Team (hey, give me a break, I was working while I \"watched\" it.  )\nAwakenings\nEvent Horizon\nU.S. Marshals\n\nRobin Williams is incredible.  I really hope that \"What Dreams May Come\" is as great as it looks.  I loved the his performance in \"Good Will Hunting.\" (and everything else he's done so far!) ...I'm hearing \"not so good\" things about \"What Dreams May Come\".  Hmmmmmmm. :(\n\nBooks read:\nYeah right.\n\n\nP.S. Thanks to The Hound for trying to let people know our AI hiring campaign was over.  The deluge has calmed again...  if you emailed Glen (or me), and I haven't gotten back to you.  Sorry.  I should be able to respond to the emails within the next two weeks.\n\n\n1998.10.6\n\nI'll sec"}, {"by": "mrabas@wardsix.com", "time": 966372840, "contents": "User:   mrabas\nRead:   0\nUnread: 0\nTime:   Tue, 15 Aug 2000 15:54:17 -0700"}, {"by": "mrenner@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 912804420, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Mike Renner\nEmail: mrenner@mail.ravensoft.com\nDescription: Designer\nProject: Heretic II\nLast Updated: 12/04/1998 16:49:13 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI am a putz, cuz I don't update my finger...\n"}, {"by": "mrj@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 1014910200, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Michael Raymond-Judy\nEmail: mrj@ravensoft.com\nDescription: Designer\nProject: Jedi Knight2\nLast Updated: 02/28/2002 09:38:48 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2-28-02\n\nWell, today is my last day here at Raven.

You see, when I came in today, all my Christie\nBrinkley paraphernalia had disappeared! Bob of course claims not to be\nresponsible, but that satisfied smirk hides nothing. He will pay.\n\nAs for E3, some of the guys who are going have special things planned.\nKenn, who has just been picked as a \"surprise\" attendee, will be getting\na really big surprise when Phoebus, who has been there setting up the \nsurprise since Sunday, blows him to bits with a remote-control device\njust as Kenn steps up to the SOF booth. Nothing like real live (or in this\ncase dead) gore and controversy to boost publicity. Kenn's selfless\nsacrifice will be immortalized by full 360 degree mo-cap digitization\nof his death. Hmm, having mentioned this, I hope Kenn doesn't read it\nbefore he goes, that could screw things up. Oh well.\n\nThe Trek team have their own surprises planned. Brian Pelletier will be the\none who makes history this time, when he steps onto what he thinks is a\nmock-up of a transporter, only to find himself beamed into a wall! This\nlittle stunt will satisfy several important issues -- it shows that \ntransporter technology DOES work, it gives the Trek game a hefty PR\nboost, and it finally answers the question of what would happen if a\nsolid object (in this case BR) is teleported or beamed into another\nsolid object (the wall). Explosion? Merging a la The Fly? A rip in the\nspace-time continuum that can only be repaired with a phased tachyon pulse? \nWho knows, but I wish I could be there to find out! Unless it's the \nexploding thing and it's really big, in which case I'm glad I'll be here.\n\nFinally back here at home a few of us \"old guys\" plan to stage a bloody \ncoup and round up anyone under the age of 30, exile them to the outside\nworld, and set up an autonomous free state called \"FOBGL\", which stands\nfor Fat Old Bald Guy Land. There would be free beer and pizza every night\nfor all citizens, cable and satellite sports on a 50\" TV, and a special\n\"embassy\" where visiting dignitaries (women) could mingle with the high\nmuckety-mucks of FOBGL. FOBGL will also be accepting new citizens as\nthey meet the qualifications (over 30, thinning if not completely bald,\nand at least 20 pounds over weight). Qualifications for visiting\ndignitaries will be somewhat more stringent.\n\nWell, that's it for now, check back later for more on my vendetta against \nBob. Hey, what's this under the desk? Oh god, it's the headless, armless\nand leg-less torso of my life-size Christie Brinkley doll! Bob, you bastard,\nyou'll pay for this! Oh, Christie, Christie, how could anyone do this to\nyou...?\n\n\nMRJ\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5-7-99\n\nIt was a bittersweet evening last night, where I sadly acknowledged what\nI had always feared might come to pass. Still, it was also a happy time,\nand even as I resigned myself to the fact that what had been was now no\nmore, I also was relieved by the sudden insight that even though something\nnew had replaced something old, the old would still be there to keep the\nnew company.\n\nWhat is this idiot talking about, you wonder? Scotch. Single malt, nicely\naged scotch, the kind that costs more than Bobby makes in a whole night of\nstripping. For many years now my very favorite scotch was Lagavulin, a\n16-year-old, strong-flavored, slightly smoky-toned Islay malt. But I have\nsampled a nectar which, I fear, has dethroned the ruling monarch, and\nalthough I will always have a warm place in my heart (and ever-expanding\nstomach) for Lagavulin, there is a new lord of single malts, a saucy\nSpeyside brew called Knockando, whose 18-year-old distillate of the\nbarley is a taste of heaven.\n\nHow long will Knockando reign? Who knows, there are always new brews\nout there to sample. In fact, one of my friends shared a small sample\nwith me a couple of weeks ago of a cask strength (65% alcohol, woo-hoo!)\nGlenhaven brew that was both potent and potable. However he says the\nbrewery has since burned down (or more likely exploded in a huge fireball\nwith all that alcohol in there), and since I had only one sample and I'm\nnot likely to get any more, I can hardly elevate that particular scotch\nto the purple.\n\nSO! Onward to new taste experiences, and may the best single malt win.\n\nSlainte!\n\n\nMRJ\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5-5-99\n\nIt seems there is just no pleasing some people. After my last update, I\nreceived the following kind of responses :\n\nRob Gee - \"Uh, I haven't read it yet. But I will. Soon. Really.\"\nKenn - \nBob Love - \"My lawyer will be in touch.\"\nBobby Duncanson - \"How come you stopped talking about me? It's not fair!\"\n\nNow I can kind of understand all the reactions except the last one. In\nRob's case, we all know he has to wait until one of the designers comes in\nto read it for him, since we also know artists can't read words with more\nthan 2 syllables. Yes, Rob, that IS a big word: syl-la-bles. Very good.\n\nKenn is on vacation in Texas, where he is, I believe, reliving his big \nmoment of glory on the grassy knoll, when he bent over to pick up a piece\nof used chewing gum that \"still had a few good chews left in it\" just in\ntime to miss all the excitement. I can still remember his quote from the\nnewspaper -- \"What? What? Did I miss something?\" WHAT!?!?\" The only\nperson who believes Kenn's story is Oliver Stone, and I believe that\npretty much speaks for itself.\n\nI'm not sure what Bob Love was talking about, but I think it may have to\ndo with those pictures I took of him and that porcupine. He claimed he\nwas just trying to perform the Heimlich maneuver on it, but I don't know...\nBy the way Bob, did you get all the spines out yet? That's gotta hurt.\n\nNow Bobby. Bobby Bobby Bobby Bobby, what can I say? Where should I start?\nHis alter ego as Dominique Moceanu? Done that. His pathetic loyalty to \nteams that sold all their good players or hired rejects from criminal\ninstitutions (in this case the Dallas Cowboys) to coach for them?

Ritual Happenings .]\n\nGoing to be a busy month here at Ritual, Robert just dropped on my desk a list of \nthings going on here for the rest of October and early November.  Here we go:\n\nHeavy Metal FAKK2 is working its way over to the MAC.\n\nSin the Game, also coming to the MAC. (With Gamespy support!)\n\nSin the animated movie for VHS and DVD, coming Oct 24th! (Very cool!)\nhttp://www.sinthemovie.com\n\nHeavy Metal 2000 the animted movie on VHS and DVD, for release on Oct 17th. \nhttp://http://www.heavy-metal.net\n\nHeavy Metal FAKK2 toys from the game will be in stores soon.\n\nThe Heavy Metal FAKK2 Multiplayer Add-on, FAKK2:Arena will be released sometime in\nlate October or early November.\n\nAlso, the boys over on Blair Witch 3: The Elly Kedward Tale are busy crunching away\nto bring you BW3 in November!\n\nLots of good stuff keeping us busy!\n\n\n[. FAKK2 Arena - Update .]\n\nFAKK2 arena is coming along nicely!  All of the gameplay functionality is there\nand we are busy going through user submissions finalizing and deciding on the \nfinal maps for the release.  Get your maps in soon!  I'd say there is about \n1 1/2 more weeks before we drop dead user submissions.\n\nLook for some new screenshots soon!\n\nIf you missed it the first time, for those wanting to create a map for FAKK2\nArena, goto http://www.ritual.com/FAKK2/arena.html.\n\n\n[. Other Stuff .]\n\nElite Forces was a blast.  Great Job to the folks over at Raven!\n\nFRAG4 was quite an event.  Clan battles with coaches was the last thing I \nexpected to see evolve in professional gaming.  Quite a sight to witness,\nlarge groups of totally serious, hardcore Q3 players screaming and \nyelling between teammates and their coach.  Very cool.\n\nAlso, the Doom2 tourney was most excellent.  Although, my lack of \npractice got me whacked pretty early, it was still a blast as always!\nLooking forward to the next.\n\nRush2049 DC rocks =]\n\nMission to Mars still sucks.\n\n\n\n--Thursday, September 28, 2000\n\n[. FAKK2 Arena - A call for maps .]\n\nWe are hard at work putting together FAKK2 Arena for public consumption, but we\ncan always use more maps!  Sooo....\n\nAnybody interested in getting their maps put into the official release of\nFAKK2 Arena, please send me your maps.  For specifications on what you need\nto create a map for FAKK2 Arena, check out http://www.ritual.com/FAKK2/arena.html.\n\nPlease limit the number of arenas in a single map to 4 unique arenas.  On \naverage, most arenas should have 3-4 battle areas, each with a different weaponry\nchoices and themes.\n\nAlso, please use textures we shipped with the game. \n\nOnce finished, All I will need is the .map/.scr and other relevant files, we will compile\nthe maps here.  \n\nAny questions, email me.\n\n\n[.

Rush 2049/Midtown Madness and Silent Scope .]\n\nI have to say, Rush 2049 is the best arcade driving game I have ever\nplayed.  Since Hard Drivin, only a few driving games came close to \nbeing the top driving dog, games like the arcade Ridge Racer, and the\noriginal Rush.  Now, Rush 2049 just took the trophy in my eyes.  Every\ntrack is FILLED with secret shortcuts, so many I find myself paying more\nattention to the detail on the side tracks than the actual race.  Plus,\nthe player registration feature should be incredibly cool when they start\ntaking that info from the actual arcade machine and slapping in on \nthe Rush 2049 website.\n\nMidtown Madness still gets my top PC driving game :]  Especially when \nyou play it with a Logitech Wingman Formula Force Wheel.  I played Midtown\nMadness most of the way though with the mouse, then we got our hands on\nsome Formula wheels and I had to start over it was so cool.\n\nAlso, played Silent Scope, Wow!  Finally, a step up from Time Crisis.\nPlus, after talking to some of the other Ritual guys, we started to wonder\nif Silent Scope could have one of those secret Last Starfighter chips in it.  \nIf you do good enough, some guy shows up at your door offering you a new \nand interesting career in \"professional elimination.\"   That or an offer to\nbe recruited by the Star League to defend the frontier from Xur and the \nKo-Dan Armada.  (Anybody that doesn't remember The Last Starfighter, goto\nIMDB's Last Starfighter page.)\n\nPat Hook was recently recruited to the Star League for his high scores \nin Heavy Barrel.\n\n [. Quake3 .]\n\nWith all the cool Everquest items for sale on Ebay, I wondered if I could\nsell a Railgun with 50 slugs for a few hundred...hmmm  Might be a bit tough\nsince there is no \"drop weapon\" in Q3.  Doh!\n\n\n[-- Thursday Aug 19th 1999 --]\n \n [. System Shock 2 .]\n\nOk, I was a real skeptic at first.  Being a huge fan of the original\nSystem Shock, and considering SS1 was the ONLY game that pulled me \naway from DooM for any extended amount of time, I didn't think that \na new System Shock title could even come close to the level of the \noriginal.  All the great things about the original, the in depth \ninterface, the shocking events, the creatures that scare the piss out \nof you, the storyline backed up with tons of foreshadowing via logs \nand emails, its amazingly all there in this great sequel.  SS2 is an \nincredible game, and just like the original, it has temporarily pulled \nme away from my previous vices (Quake3, RollerCoaster Tycoon, Midtown \nMadness and Worms Armageddon.) The implementation of RPG elements has\nalso got my wheels turning, I expect to play through this game a few \ntimes going different directions with my character.  I definitely \nrecommend this game to those who are not only bigtime shooter fans \nlooking for a little more, but the lite-RPG player who prefers Zelda64\nto Baulders-Gate :]\n\n [. OldSch00l .]\n\nNow for some good old C64 trivia fun.  I've been trying to remember the \nname of an oldschool C64 demo that featured a circular dotscroller on the\nfinal page of the demo.  I know there has to be a few C64'ers out there\nthat might know the name of this demo.  Anybody?  And nope, its not \nanything recent, it was one of the first demos of its kind.\n\n [. OldSch00l-lite .]\n\nHooked up the Amiga recently up at the office. :]  Oh how I miss great \ngames that fit on one 720k floppy.  Also, why hasn't anybody done an\ninternet version of New World Computing's Nuclear War?  Man, that would\nrock!\n\nOk, Back to FAKK!\n\n\"Good. Bad.

Elliot\nEmail address: myscha@nettally.com\n----------\nMyscha the sled dog\nUser: T. Elliot Cannon-Architect\nUNREAL Level Designer-\nDesigner/Consultant to EPIC-MegaGames\n\nJan 17th, 1999\nI just noticed Cliff released some of the DM maps we made that were originally planned to be released with the final Version of the Unreal net Patch-but Tim is still working on it. I'm glad they have been released now so gamers don't have to wait to play.\nI've got a question for you gamers out there.\n\nGAMMA SETTINGS> I noticed on PlanetUnreal that some screenshots were taken of the various maps. I also noticed they looked really washed out. Like the 3DFX Gamma setings were really High or something.\n\nWhen I first got my Diamond Monsters Voodoo 1 I beleive the default Gamma Setting was 1.7-When I got my Voodoo 2 (Creative Labs this time SLI)The default went to 1.3.\nFor me personally I have always enjoyed 1.0. The reason being is adjusting lighting in the editor seems to best match this. Such that if you edit the lighting in a level-the view in the 3D preview view with Lighting turned on-looks more like it in the game-Thus your lighting tweaks match up better.\nOf course Editing is a Software renderer and these shots are 3DFX.\n\nNow I know many times when I'm Deathmatching-all I care about is being able to see jokers slipping through the shadows-Like When I play The Fragpipe online-(Quake2)I always zip my gamma up real quick-whereas the other point release Q2 dm maps seem lighted fine for 1.0 Gamma settings. I'm not saying one is bad and one is good here-I'm just noting an observation about Gamma settings- I know Cliff and I argue about this alot. He likes his stuff at High Gamma-and I like mine low closer to true color. I admit that I like my Gamma settings lower than most folks-I always felt it gives a more realistic appearance to the environments.\n\nCheck out the differences between these shots. (if you have mucho bandwidth)\nhttp://www.nettally.com/myscha/gamma.html\n\nAll that really matters however is that folks have a blast killing each other-whether they like their Gamma high or not.\n\nThis is a Visual Quality Issue that needs to be Standardized amongst developers-or each individual title should help you to adjust your display settings so that the final product appears the way it should.\n\nEven though Riven, by CYAN, isn't a First person shooter, I really liked how they had a set up a menu where you were asked to adjust your display settings easily to make a specific graphic appear a certain way-in hopes of preserving the visual quality of the original design intent.\n\nHalf-Life also offered control over this with an in game screenshot in a display menu.\n\nAs games get more and more detailed and hopefully more and more immersive, little things like gamma settings the game is to be played on and/or designed around will make a difference to the discriminating gamer.\nIMO.\n\nHave fun with the maps-and control those 4 health packs in DM-Letting and you'll be fine.\n\nJan 15th, 1999\n\nMy favorite Games of 1998-(not that anyone cares-but anyway-in no specific order)\n\nQuake2 (although released in December 1997-it's still a classic)\n\nStarcraft-Some of the most impressive Graphics for menus and movies in any game.\nUnique mythology and character designs. One of the best RTS games ever made.\n\nDescent Freespace: HUGE ships! Ongoing war with plot twists, mission based, excellent effects, outstanding weapon designs, got drawn into this one and couldn't wait to see what was next.\n\nCommandoes: Unique thinking, awesome mission settings- but HARD HARD HARD. I still haven't finished it. The mission designs are stunning.\n\nUltima Online: Still playing.Ongoing game that you never \"beat\" and delete off yer hardrive. Haven't been PK'ed in 6 months :)\n\nFallout 2: I missed Fallout 1, I absolutely was thoroughly impressed by the sequel. Great settings, bloody combat hit animations, unique story and mythos. The menu style with it's retro-industrial feel was executed perfectly.\n\nUnreal: Biased. Bluff Eversmoking one of my all time favorites. The Skaarj Warrior has to be one of the best monsters ever done in FPS for combat skill.\n\nHeretic 2: EFFECTS!! Mucho animations, Melee combat with blood flying everywhere. Awesome Co-op play. Drop kicking that final boss with Brandon was hilarious. That sneak animation is the best.\nStaff weapon the BOMB! I think I played 95% of the entire game slinging that kick ass staff around.\n\nBaldur's Gate: AD&D true to original and hugeeeeee. Close to ending-stuck on 2 Greater basilisks.\n\nHalf-Life: The coolest Machine gun I've ever used. Great effects. Unique storyline. Hundreds of maps. Laser Trip mines perfect.\nNPC interaction. The Marines are totally fun.\nHardest skill level uncanny.\n\n-------"}, {"by": "nadalini@ionstorm.com", "time": 921871980, "contents": "\n*** Ion Storm's Finger Server\n\nUser name: nadalini\nPlan modified: Fri Mar 19 15:30:17 1999\n\n"}, {"by": "nalbury@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 944085420, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Nathan Albury\nEmail: nalbury@mail.ravensoft.com\nDescription: Programmer\nProject: SoF\nLast Updated: 12/01/1999 17:38:18 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n12-1-99, part 2\n\nJust for the record, I don't think \"Canada is gay\", whatever that would mean.\nCanada is not gay, and neither am I, therefore, technically, I am as gay as\nCanada, no more, no less.

I think these\nare very important points to remember.\n\nUm, please don't be offended by this .plan update, also.  Tongue is planted\nfirmly in cheek here and all that.\n\n12-1-99\n\nI must say, good job, Epic.  Unreal Tournament is extremely cool.  I wasn't\nexpecting to get into any of the upcoming deathmatch-only games as I haven't\nbeen into deathmatch for a while, but UT is just too cool to pass up.  Nice!\n\nI've given this a lot of thought, and I regret to say that if I had to judge\nhumanity as a whole based solely off my exposure to it via the internet, I\nhave a strong feeling I would put everyone to death and make the world a\nbetter place.  Is it really so difficult to have a bit of civility?  Is it so\ntough to see past your own tiny little nose and realize that the rest of the\nworld doesn't exist solely to entertain you?  (I don't mean you as in you,\nwhoever is reading this, of course...  Instead I mean you, the people who are\nfrustrating me to no end.)  Here's a thought;  if, for whatever reason, you\nwant to persuade someone else to do something for you or to see something\nfrom your point of view, here are some good approaches: Ask nicely.  Bring up\nlogical reasons.  Be polite in your requests.  Give the other person as much\nrespect as you want them to give you.  Go in knowing that the other person\ndoesn't owe you anything.  Now, with that out of the way, here are some bad\napproaches: \"Your game sucks!!1!  i was playing it and the ai was gay.  i\nshotted tons of gusy and way to many of them died - youre game should only\nhave about 10 guys each level.  Having a lot of guys is unrealiztic.  You\nbetter take respawning out - who ever put that in made a huge mistkae.  Respawnig\nis really really gay.  I cant believe you guys couldnt see how much respawning\nsucked when you put this out.  I really hope you plan on spending a lot more\ntime on this game, because this is totally unacceptable.\"\n\nI am programming AI, and I am working on spawning, now to the exclusion of all\nelse.  I really and truly want to improve and/or change them if it's going to\nhelp Soldier of Fortune out, and to be honest they're very interesting and\nenjoyable challenges.  I'm actually glad that Blue mentioned the spawning a\nwhile back, because it made a few of us take a closer look at it, and in\nretrospect I can see why he would complain.  I have a lot of ideas that I plan\non trying out to make it a much more viable play mechanic - but none of us here\nhave any intentions of removing it completely.  It will just be adjusted / changed\nuntil it is more fun, which is, after all, the point of a game.\n\nBut if you honestly want to provide critisism and have your opinion be a factor\nat all when discussing things in a public forum that developers have access to,\nI can tell you one method for certain that doesn't get me thinking, \"By Jove,\nthis fellow IS right!  I hadn't noticed it before, but, watching my men run\naround, their AI is totally gay.  I can't believe how gay their AI is.  I\nbetter make it straight.\"  (Well, I guess, anyway.  I have no idea what the\nopposite of \"gay ai\" is.)  Nevermind that announcing that other people\nwho are working hard at a difficult job have made a huge mistake while you lounge\naround on your chair downloading goat-porn-granny-fellatio-pix is incredibly rude;\nnevermind that spouting off from your ivory tower that matters of opinion are\nsubject to your decrees as gospel truth is the height of pomposity; nevermind\nthat making this game has swallowed 2 full years of most of our lives compared to the forty\ndollars that you'll have to shell out if you really decide not to warez it from\nyour 13374ZZ buddies anyway, which no one is even FORCING YOU TO BUY.  Nevermind\nall that, because even if you don't consider any of it, the fact remains that\nwhen you treat developers like crap, they ignore you.  Except when they get\nparticularly pissed off and update their fingers.  That's the only time they\ndon't ignore you.\n\nNot everyone will like Soldier of Fortune.  No game can ever please everyone.\nOur game is about action and violence, and if you're looking for something else,\nparticularly if you come in deciding what our game has to be rather than\ntaking the time to see what it is, you're likely to be extremely disappointed, and\nI'm sorry.  I truly am.  We're doing what we can to make Soldier of Fortune as\ncool as possible, and I really think we're succeeding.  Lots of gameplay elements\nincluding the AI have come a long way recently, and it's cool seeing that come\ntogether.  But... ah, nevermind, what's the point.  Most of you really don't\nneed to read this, and the people who do are probably going to skim over it\nand then start a huge flame war on various message boards with threads like\n\"Nathan is gayer than Canada\" and \"Macintosh was invented by Hitler vs. gay\natheists.\"  \n\n\nOkay, ventings over.  I feel better now =)  Whew.  You can all come out from\nhiding.  If I don't ever update my plan again it's because I'm gayer than Canada."}, {"by": "nalbury@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 947972220, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Nathan Albury\nEmail: nalbury@mail.ravensoft.com\nDescription: Programmer\nProject: SoF\nLast Updated: 01/15/2000 02:57:06 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1-15-00\n\nIt seems like there's still a fair amount of confusion on some of the more\ncontrovertial issues in Soldier of Fortune, so here's my sad attempt to\nclear it up a bit.\n\nIn regards to enemy spawning and limited saves, these two attributes of the\ngame are dictated by the difficultly level.  HOWEVER, in addition to our 5\npreset difficultly levels, we have a custom difficultly level submenu that will allow\nyou to adjust the game more to your liking if you aren't pleased with our\ndefaults.  So, for example, if you like smart enemies but can't stand spawning,\nyou can set up the game to accomodate that.  Or, if you are more interested in\na higher intensity, more Doom-style shooter, you can crank up the spawning and\ndrop the enemy ai down.  The game can be played according to your tastes.\n\nWith that said, I'm extremely hopeful that once people get a hold of our demo\nthey'll at least give our vision of the game a chance.  We've taken the feedback\nwe've gotten into account, and honestly we've now had the chance to play the game a lot\nmore.  The amount of tweaks that have occured since our last OEM and the present\ndemo are quite vast.\n\nIn particular, the AI has come a long way since our previous version.  It's\nfinally to the point where playing the game stealthily can be entertaining,\nif that's what you're looking for.  I'm still of the opinion that maxing out\nenemy AI to inhuman levels isn't a good approach to game creation, but\nI do think that our guys are reacting in a much more believeable, enjoyable\nfashion.\n\nAs far as the spawning is concerned, we've greatly refined and adjusted the\nplay mechanics behind it so that it enhances rather than confuses the gameplay.\nProbably the most common complaint about spawning is that it invalidates stealthy\nplay... and I think that's a fair point.  In our current system, the spawning\nexists in large part to ENHANCE the stealth.  There are no more instances where\nyou can wander around quietly, taking great care to lean around corners and\npick people off, only to get shot in the back by some wandering punk.  If guys\nare spawning, it's exclusively because you're making a whole lot of noise and\ncarnage.  In fact, our challenging difficultly level (4 out of 5) is\nalmost impossible if you don't rely on stealth - the enemies are quick enough\nand powerful enough that if you draw a crowd, you will fall over.  And, once\nagain, if you really don't like spawning to the point of religiousness, you\ncan turn it off.\n\nHopefully (fingers crossed) this will help clear up a few things that seem to\nbe distressing a lot of you.  Well, back to work, I suppose...\n\n\n\n12-1-99, part 2\n\nJust for the record, I don't think \"Canada is gay\", whatever that would mean.\nCanada is not gay, and neither am I, therefore, technically, I am as gay as\nCanada, no more, no less.

Tongue is planted\nfirmly in cheek here and all that.\n\n12-1-99\n\nI must say, good job, Epic.  Unreal Tournament is extremely cool.  I wasn't\nexpecting to get into any of the upcoming deathmatch-only games as I haven't\nbeen into deathmatch for a while, but UT is just too cool to pass up.  Nice!\n\nI've given this a lot of thought, and I regret to say that if I had to judge\nhumanity as a whole based solely off my exposure to it via the internet, I\nhave a strong feeling I would put everyone to death and make the world a\nbetter place.  Is it really so difficult to have a bit of civility?  Is it so\ntough to see past your own tiny little nose and realize that the rest of the\nworld doesn't exist solely to entertain you?  (I don't mean you as in you,\nwhoever is reading this, of course...  Instead I mean you, the people who are\nfrustrating me to no end.)  Here's a thought;  if, for whatever reason, you\nwant to persuade someone else to do something for you or to see something\nfrom your point of view, here are some good approaches: Ask nicely.  Bring up\nlogical reasons.  Be polite in your requests.  Give the other person as much\nrespect as you want them to give you.  Go in knowing that the other person\ndoesn't owe you anything.  Now, with that out of the way, here are some bad\napproaches: \"Your game sucks!!1!  i was playing it and the ai was gay.  i\nshotted tons of gusy and way to many of them died - youre game should only\nhave about 10 guys each level.  Having a lot of guys is unrealiztic.  You\nbetter take respawning out - who ever put that in made a huge mistkae.  Respawnig\nis really really gay.  I cant believe you guys couldnt see how much respawning\nsucked when you put this out.  I really hope you plan on spending a lot more\ntime on this game, because this is totally unacceptable.\"\n\nI am programming AI, and I am working on spawning, now to the exclusion of all\nelse.  I really and truly want to improve and/or change them if it's going to\nhelp Soldier of Fortune out, and to be honest they're very interesting and\nenjoyable challenges.  I'm actually glad that Blue mentioned the spawning a\nwhile back, because it made a few of us take a closer look at it, and in\nretrospect I can see why he would complain.  I have a lot of ideas that I plan\non trying out to make it a much more viable play mechanic - but none of us here\nhave any intentions of removing it completely.  It will just be adjusted / changed\nuntil it is more fun, which is, after all, the point of a game.\n\nBut if you honestly want to provide critisism and have your opinion be a factor\nat all when discussing things in a public forum that developers have access to,\nI can tell you one method for certain that doesn't get me thinking, \"By Jove,\nthis fellow IS right!  I hadn't noticed it before, but, watching my men run\naround, their AI is totally gay.  I can't believe how gay their AI is.  I\nbetter make it straight.\"  (Well, I guess, anyway.  I have no idea what the\nopposite of \"gay ai\" is.)  Nevermind that announcing that other people\nwho are working hard at a difficult job have made a huge mistake while you lounge\naround on your chair downloading goat-porn-granny-fellatio-pix is incredibly rude;\nnevermind that spouting off from your ivory tower that matters of opinion are\nsubject to your decrees as gospel truth is the height of pomposity; nevermind\nthat making this game has swallowed 2 full years of most of our lives compared to the forty\ndollars that you'll have to shell out if you really decide not to warez it from\nyour 13374ZZ buddies anyway, which no one is even FORCING YOU TO BUY.  Nevermind\nall that, because even if you don't consider any of it, the fact remains that\nwhen you treat developers like crap, they ignore you.  Except when they get\nparticularly pissed off and update their fingers.  That's the only time they\ndon't ignore you.\n\nNot everyone will like Soldier of Fortune.  No game can ever please everyone.\nOur game is about action and violence, and if you're looking for something else,\nparticularly if you come in deciding what our game has to be rather than\ntaking the time to see what it is, you're likely to be extremely disappointed, and\nI'm sorry.  I truly am.  We're doing what we can to make Soldier of Fortune as\ncool as possible, and I really think we're succeeding.  Lots of gameplay elements\nincluding the AI have come a long way recently, and it's cool seeing that come\ntogether.  But... ah, nevermind, what's the point.  Most of you really don't\nneed to read this, and the people who do are probably going to skim over it\nand then start a huge flame war on various message boards with threads like\n\"Nathan is gayer than Canada\" and \"Macintosh was invented by Hitler vs. gay\natheists.\"  \n\n\nOkay, ventings over.  I feel better now =)  Whew.  You can all come out from\nhiding.  If I don't ever update my plan again it's because I'm gayer than Canada."}, {"by": "natas@ionstorm.com", "time": 876793980, "contents": "Ion Storm\n\nUser Name.........natas\nFull Name.........Mark Fletcher\nDescription.......MIS Dude\nLast NT Logon.....Monday, October 13, 1997 at 22:35\n\n\n\n\n\n10/13/97-\tArcade auctions rule!!!

I'm holdin' down\nthe fort while they are gone... workin' hard! ;)\n\n     The demo we sent to E3 is, IMHO, awesome.  Sure,\nTribes 2 is around a year away, and yeah, this is\njust the very tip of the iceberg but damn it looks\ngood so far.  I think our E3 presence should generate\nsome heat this year.  Be sure to check us out if you\nare at the show.\n\n[5/4]\n     Hard to believe it's been so long since I\nupdated.  Hmmm... must be busy or something.\n\n     Speaking of busy, we are cranking on the E3\ndemo for Tribes 2.  Even though this isn't set for\nrelease until next year it is already looking hot.\nEveryone on the team is doing awesome work for the\nnew game.\n\n     On the Tribes 1 front, the recently released\npatch 1.4.1 plugs some serious security holes in the\nserver.  It is strongly recommended that all server\nopperators update asap.  Also, the 1.4 release in\ngeneral fixed some possible cheats over the 1.3\nversions. So, yeah, get it.\n\n     OpenGL - we are still working with nVidia to get\ndrivers that will run Tribes acceptably on the TNT\nand TNT 2.\n\n     I actually had a Mac G3 in my office for a\ncouple of days!  Ugh.  Still, had to check out Q3A.\nInteresting.  Gameplay didn't turn my crank but the\ngraphics looked nice.\n\n\n[3/26]\n     Just a quick note of clarification about the\nQuake(2) editor stuff.  The added support will allow\n3rd party editors to be used to make the buildings\nthat get placed in Tribes maps.  Creating landscapes,\nplacing objects, mission scripting, etc. will all\nstill be handled via the various tools that ship with\nTribes and/or get shipped in the near future in our\nfree editing package/patch.  Obviously, it would be\nvery limiting to use a Quake-style editor to try to\nmake a whole Tribes level.\n\n\n[3/25]\n     ZED is dead, baby...\n\n     We are putting the (hopefully) finishing touches\non the various mission building tools as well as a\nfew tweaks to the OpenGL stuff.  We have decided to\nend development on our in-house building editor,\n\"ZED\".  We will probably release the current version\nof ZED with the other tools but in the near future it\nwill be replaced with a converter for Quake-style\nmaps.  Since there are so many good Quake(2) map\neditors around (WorldCraft, etc.) this is a pretty\neasy decision at this point.  Of course, way back\nwhen we started on Tribes there weren't very many\nnice editors available and it seemed like a good idea\nto build our own.

I'll try to keep the updates coming a bit more regularly from now on.\n\nAhh E3, lots of cool stuff there this year, some of the coolest stuff I saw there this year included:\n\n* Mech Commander by FASA - an awesome 2D/3D RTS game in the BattleTech universe.  This thing has some of the best sounds, graphics, playability and especially AI that I've ever seen in an RTS game.  Good going Glen!\n* Homeworld by Sierra - This 3D RTS was simply amazing! The physics were nearly perfect, and the gameplay looked quite solid as well.\n* Half-life by Sierra - Half-life looks pretty cool, the scripted sequences and AI really add to gameplay in a big way... I also like the little 'bouncy bug' grenade thingees.\n* The new game by SquareSoft (don't remember the name) - This game is a must for anime and FF7 fans, and the story looks awesome - can't wait to get my hands on this one!\n* Via Voice Gold by IBM.  This voice recognition package is definantly the best yet.  The guy demoing it was literally speaking freely and normally in the E3 convention center (with a *HUGE* amount of background noise), and the software was able to translate with nearly 100% accuracy - and in context!  This software was so accurate it would even pick up the 'uhh's and 'um's most people inadvertantly use in everyday life.  I've got to get a copy of this to help with my email (and perhaps coding - don't know about this though, I might drive Chris insane :^) )\n* Saitek's PCDash - this is just a keybord extension that you can use a printed graphical underlay to make up your own key macros.  It definantly helps cut down the learning curve for games, but I will mainly be using it to make a macro setup for Visual C++/Visual Source Safe (ie. a button to compile, rebuild all, switch between debug/release, switch between projects, etc).  Most cool, and very useful.\n\n\tOf course, 3D Realms also had all our killer games on display (Duke Nukem Forever, Prey, and Max Payne) but in an effort to seem -somewhat- modest and unbiased, I've refrained from listing them above - I'll just say that we had an excellent show :^).  I also got to meet the guys from Remedy for the first time at E3, they are definantly a talented bunch, and are doing an awesome job on Max Payne - do I sense a bit of internal competition? :^).\n\n\tBack to work again. While E3 was fun, I did find myself going through coding withdrawal and am glad to be back in a place where I can hit F7 many times in a row and be rewarded by lots of noisy disk activity.  I'll be popping up an update later this week with some of the more recent technical happenings.\n\n\n[3/5/98]\n\n\tThanks to everyone who sent in suggestions for DukeEd, and keep 'em coming!\n\n\tThings are pretty hectic around here lateley.\n\n\tThe new entity system is progressing nicely, the base system should be finished by Monday or Tuesday - after which I'll begin writing the core scripts and DukeEd script generation 'wizards'.  For those of you who were asking: yes we will support and release source code for .DLL's in addition to the scripting system - though internally we will be using the scripting system as much as possible (since it's 90% of the speed of compiled .DLL's anyways).\n\n\tChris has been working feverishly on overhauling Cannibal's interface and part/animation sequencing features - there should be some screen-shots of it released fairly soon.     \n \n\tWell, earlier this week, several people (65+ I've heard) were using the 'Cheat 'O Matic' utility I wrote to do some serious cheating on Sierra's online game \"The Realm\". The cheaters in question were able to use Cheat 'O Matic to give themselves a huge amount of negative manna, and indirectly convert it into enormous sums of gold.  Anyways apparently this had the effect of decimating the Realm's virtual economy, and Sierra had to shut it down on Tuesday to fix the problem.  \n\tI had actually warned Sierra about this potential problem shortly after the Realm's initial release (not wanting potentially malicious Cheat 'O Matic users to destroy an otherwise nifty multiplayer game), but the online GM ignored my warning and promptly banned me from the Realm.  Well, at least I tried...\n\tIn any case, soon after Sierra had fixed the bug, I found that Geocities had canned the Cheat 'O Matic site, stating that they reserved the right to boot 'anyone for any reason' - hmmm.....  Luckilly, George was kind enough to let me use the company web site as Cheat 'O Matic's new home, so look for it up there in a few days.\n\nYou can read more about the incident in the Realm's online newspaper here:\n\thttp://www.public.usit.net/nrspears/news.html  (See the 3/3/98 and 3/2/98 entries)\n\n\n[2/26/98]\n\n\tVhelp, this is my first .plan file, so bear with me here until I get the hang of it. I'll try to get in an update every week or so, but we're starting to get geared up for E3, so free-time is hard to come by.\n\n\tI recently finished integrating the new scripting system ('DukeC') into the engine codebase,  it took a bit longer than I expected (always seems to ;^) ), but definantly worth it.  \n\tAt the moment, I'm working on replacing the Quake2 entity system with our new, improved entity system.

Writtrn by Jenny Arata of Mertolight Studios, it explains how to do a great demo reel.\n-later\n\nReel Opportunities\nGetting Noticed By Prospective Employers For Computer Animators\n(c) 1997 Jenny Arata \n\n\n Your resume and demo reel are the first impression you will make on a prospective employer. Therefore, it is prudent to make the best impression possible.\n\nThe following is a general guideline to help you target your market and to shape your resume and demo reel into presentable form.\n\nThe resume\n\nKeep your resume as plain and to the point as possible by keeping all information easy to find at a glance (this includes having a legible and normal-sized font!). Demonstrating your designing ability by having an\nover-designed, \"cute\" resume is a visual turn-off because it is generally difficult to read and pull out the pertinent information.\n\nThe most important information is:\n\n\u00c2\u0095 Complete address, phone numbers and email. \n\n\u00c2\u0095 Software knowledge and years spent with the software.\n\n\u00c2\u0095 Practical professional experience only. If you worked for a firm that utilized your CGI knowledge or artistic capabilities, that's important.\n\n\u00c2\u0095 Art/film school or university attended. Not a determining factor in hiring, however.\n\n\u00c2\u0095 Relevant coursework.\n\nKeep information relevant to the company you are submitting to. If you want to do only cartoon animation, submit specifically to those companies. \n\nDo not include copies of your drawings, sketches, etc, when applying for a computer animator position.  You may, however, bring them to the interview as well as mention that you have a portfolio.\n\nNote: Always have someone proof-read your resume for errors and general content. \n\n\nThe demo reel\n\nWhile I cannot tell you what to put on your reel, I can say that it's important to make an impression. It is always nice to see spoofs of products or commercials. Anything that tells a short story and makes us laugh is good. Works in progress are okay as long as you label it so and\neven explain what you'd like to do with it.\n\nPut your best animation forward by placing the work you think is the best first. Don't assemble your work in chronological order from when you first started learning. Just include your best work.\n\nTapes and resumes have been known to get separated, so make sure the tape has all contact information on it.\n\nAlthough which software you know is important, how well you know and manipulate it is of greater value.  And what have you done creatively with it?\n\nThe following basic animations are not of interest:\n\n\u00c2\u0095 stick figures doing a walking/running test in place\n\u00c2\u0095 bouncing balls\n\u00c2\u0095 bouncing boxes\n\u00c2\u0095 simple bugs\n\u00c2\u0095 simple robots\n\u00c2\u0095 simple spaceships\n\nThese animations are more interesting and are commonly desired by the industry:\n\n\u00c2\u0095 natural phenomenon (includes snow, clouds, water, fire, etc.)\n\n\u00c2\u0095 sophisticated imagery animation (includes creatures, characters, cars, mattes, objects)\n\nMake certain your camera moves are smooth.\n\nMake certain your lighting is consistent.\n\nDo not repeat the works on your demo reel simply to make it longer.\n\nAlways include a log of what is on the demo reel and specify exactly what you did on the animations. If more than one person worked on a specific piece, be sure to say which part of the piece you did.\n\nMusic helps. A reel with no music is boring.\n\nStill pics of drawings, computer animations, sculptures, etc. on your reel are not recommended when you are submitting to an animation / effects house. The key word is animate (i.e. motion).\n\nEdit. Edit. Edit!\n\nThings not to put on your demo reel:\n\nThink about the impression you want to make on a prospective employer. Gratuitous, graphic violence, blood/gore and sexual perversion may not present you in the best light and may turn off those screening the demo\nreels. The message that comes to mind is, \"Do we really want a person who spends time thinking/doing this working for us??\"\n\nColor bars and tone are never necessary.\n\nShipping\n\nDemo reels should not come bare. Keep them in the protective case they came in or buy the very inexpensive cardboard ones. Too many reels arrive smashed by the postal system when unprotected, although hard plastic cases\nare not necessary.\n\nSend demo reels in bubble bags, not jiffy bags (padded with pulp paper) and not the cardboard priority mail envelope (very smashable). Jiffy bags burst and can ruin your demo reel. Your post office should have bubble bags and if not, check with you local office supply store. I recommend the #1 size.\n\nDon't overdo the packaging. Expensive packaging isn't necessary, and it doesn't impress anyone. It ends up in the trash or recycle bin along with the cheap packaging. \n\nUnless specifically requested to do so, do not send the demo reels UPS, FEDEX, certified or anything else that is an extra expense. Save yourself the money and just send things regular mail. You may feel an urgency to send out your reel, but on the receiving end, there's no urgency.\n\nAfter the information has been sent:\n\nDon't badger the company as to whether or not they've received your resume and/or demo reel. Even if you think you're being polite in making an inquiry, it feels like badgering. If the company is interested, you will be\ncontacted for an interview. If not, you might receive a written notice.\nSome companies return demo reels and some do not. If you specifically wish for the return of your demo, enclose a self-addressed stamped envelope (padded, of course). NEVER send your only demo reel. Always make a dub.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nAlthough software knowledge is important, I cannot stress enough how much more we and our competitors look for creative talent above all. We know that students often do not have access to the high-end software packages or\nto the proper resources. That is why it is extremely important to become very proficient on the software you can get hold of.\n\nI hope this helps, and the best of luck to everyone!\n\n___________________________\n\nJenny Arata has been with MetroLight Studios since 1992 and among her many\nother duties\nreviews all demo reels and resumes. \n\nMetroLight Studios Inc. is a Los Angeles based Academy Award winning\nanimation house\nspecializing in high-end computer-generated imagery and digital special\neffects. \n\nwww.metrolight.com\n\n\n"}, {"by": "paul@lith.com", "time": 922296540, "contents": "\n*** Monolith Production's Finger Server\n\nUser name: paul\nPlan modified: Wed Mar 24 11:17:17 1999\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t3/24/99\n\nI would like to bid Dan Davis a fond farewell, he contributed greatly to \"GRUNTZ\" and had his hands in\nalmost all of Monoliths current releases and projects.

Mostly since we can\u00c2\u0092t fully talk about the game yet there isn\u00c2\u0092t much worthy of a great plan update. I still get a lot of people asking for updates (Chris) and they never seem to stop (Chris).\n\nThe \u00c2\u0093secret\u00c2\u0094 game that we have been giving hints on (non-fps LithTech) and is very close to official press release and the first screenshots. The lawyers have been working to clear the tm issues up this week. Being almost 2000 it\u00c2\u0092s very difficult to name a product that doesn\u00c2\u0092t somehow conflict with something already out there. St. John is working on some screens with the team and I think is ready to kill me. All of the screens that we have shown from our past games are legit. Its difficult to show screens of a game so early in development that makes the screens look how they should. I guess that\u00c2\u0092s why you see many other people PhotoShop up some screens and make everything perfect and put things like shadows in there even if the game doesn\u00c2\u0092t have them. After hitting F8 a million times looking for that perfect shot sometimes a mock screen sounds pretty good.\n\nJeremy is acting as the PR tech side for LithTech and the other projects he is working on. If you have any tech questions that involve code samples ask him and not me. If it can\u00c2\u0092t be done in HTML and VBScript then I have no idea what you\u00c2\u0092re talking about. I know that he is setting up mailing lists for most of the popular subjects, Linux port I believe is one of them. If you are looking to do a big Shogo/Blood2/LithTech project it would be best to contact both of us.\n\nStill looking for some great Shogo mods out there. The Squishy vs Mecha is by far the best out now. Many people are looking to get at the B2 source this month and I\u00c2\u0092m sure that some great mods and levels will come out of that. \n\nWell since I don\u00c2\u0092t have a lot of juicy info in this update I thought I would slip in a character pic from the \u00c2\u0093secret\u00c2\u0094 game.

Since the game is out now ... I can talk.  I recently posted a version of this on one of  Scary\u00c2\u0092s discussions boards and thought I\u00c2\u0092d make it available in a more general forum.  This is what happened to some of the \"lost\" things that have appeared in older screenshots, but not in the final game.\n\nLost Models\n     There\u00c2\u0092s been some discussion on various boards as to whatever happened to the \"designer\" models that appeared in early screenshots. They were intended as tests for Steed and Carmack to work out the kinks in the MD3 models.  They were fun, but they weren\u00c2\u0092t final. Even with the eclectic mix of our final models, they would have been out of place.  And like the unused maps, the way they were constructed (including the use of multiple component piece skins) is not completely compatible with the final model versions.  \n\nLost Particles\n     OK, now let\u00c2\u0092s talk about that weapon with the particle trail that the \"xian\" model is shooting in some old screen shots. I\u00c2\u0092m pretty certain that was an early version of the plasma gun.  It looks cool and I like the particles. We certainly could have done some awesome things with them as the shader functions matured, but as a game feature in Q3A, they were problematic at best. While testing Q3Test2 (now Q3dm17), we learned that a single rail shot added an instant hit of 3000+ triangle faces (all Q3 particles are made of polygon triangles) to the map. In bigger space maps that followed, it would have been far worse. So the feature changed.  We had similar problems with other functions using particles. And so, particles left the game.\n\nMany Hands\n     Touching on Tim Willits\u00c2\u0092 comments about many hands touching the maps. Generally speaking, one designer created the map ... usually after discussing feature ideas with the design group. He would work out the play concepts and establish a general architectural style. At some point during development, the map would be handed off to another designer to fix problems involving curves, tweak some play problems, and maybe punch up the appearance of some of the architecture. Then the artists would get involved, making special models and custom textures. They did for our maps what an interior decorator does for real world buildings -- taking fairly drab settings and making them into pieces of art.  And while everyone outside the company seems to want to pigeon-hole our artists into narrow task functions, I\u00c2\u0092d like to point out that ALL our artists worked on the arenas, not just Kevin Cloud and Adrian Carmack. I\u00c2\u0092d like to mention that several arenas owe their distinctive and totally awe-inspiring appearances to Kenneth Scott\u00c2\u0092s phenomenal \"set design\", model building and texture-making abilities (and everyone thinks he just does skins ... Hah!).  \n\nLost Maps\n     Back on the topic of \"lost\" maps. Anyone who has ever made a map, professionally, semi-professionally, or just for fun, knows that map development goes through stages.  You build stuff. You make it look as \"pretty\" as a map guy can. You test it, debate it with your peers and then rebuild the parts that didn\u00c2\u0092t work. If it\u00c2\u0092s your job, you do this a lot. Along the way, you leave a pretty hefty debris trail.  Quite a number of the \"lost\" maps that show up in early screenshots are prototypes of the final maps (or at least things that ended up in the final maps).\n\n     By way of example, I can discuss Q3DM8: Brimstone Abbey. This map originally began as a sprawling, mostly flat map; a literal maze of corridors. Several early screenshots show parts of that \"lost\" map.  As the game matured, the design concept for that map was deemed inappropriate. That map was scrapped, but at least one feature was salvaged ... the cathedral room.  The next iteration was another big map combining the cathedral with the base portion of a CTF map that was under development.  It was scrapped, but now the cathedral had balconies and a lift up to the high ledges that connected to the power-up ledge. That level consisted of the central cathedral, some halls around the upper level (with stairs to the lower) and a large courtyard (where the drowing pool is now located).  The cathedral lift became a jump pad. Stairs were scrapped, the large courtyard became a pool (to show water at E3), the hall connecting the drowning pool with the cathedral was redesigned based on a suggestion from Jim Molinets of Rogue and the rocket launcher courtyard with it\u00c2\u0092s distinctive \"pop-up toaster\" jump pad was added.  But architecturally, it\u00c2\u0092s not far removed from that long lost original.\n\n     I took a look through the screenshots of the \"lost\" \"organic\" maps that everyone is mooning over.  They probably could be built with the current status of the engine (please note that the way we built curves changed at LEAST three times over the course of Quake 3 development).  But as you map makers will soon discover, curves are great, but their cost in polygons adds up fast. Add some fog and it only gets worse.  The IHV version of the mouth that appears in Q3DM1 had to be completely rebuilt to make it a playable area with a manageable polygon count.\n\nPining for the Great Outdoors\n     Regarding large, outdoor maps that seem to be on everyone\u00c2\u0092s wish list.  I spent a lot of my development time trying to make naturalistic looking outdoor terrain work, including using both curve patches and the Q2 terrain-maker, Gensurf (which I really like).  During that period of development we had some issues with sloped surfaces, which made movement over the terrain something between unsatisfying and nearly impossible.  And, as it is with the space maps and large curve areas, when a lot of the map is in your view field all at once, those polies add up quickly.  None of these experiments developed into satisfying DM maps. So when the maps were sorted and culled into the final tiers, there were no outdoor maps selected for final development.  I haven\u00c2\u0092t abandoned the idea of large outdoor terrain maps and I am planning on more experimentation in that area.\n\n     Finally, we haven\u00c2\u0092t thrown out the old \"lost\" maps. If we do anything with them, it will be to go through them, pull out the workable ideas that didn\u00c2\u0092t fit the final production maps and include them in new maps.\n\nPaul Jaquays\ndesigner\nid Software, inc.\n\nAnd, by the way, a lot of the Q3A reviews I\u00c2\u0092ve been reading lately look a little rushed to me. I can\u00c2\u0092t help but wonder if they would been far better if they just had more paragraphs in them. ;-)\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nIf it's not here, it's vapor.

Instead of saying \"Thanks for the support\" to these devoted fans of their game, cartoon character, or movie, they move to shut down the mod and demand it no longer be worked upon or distributed.

Free Stuff!\n\nid has just released a map pack containing four team-style maps approved for use with id Software\u00c2\u0092s Quake III: Team Arena\u00c2\u0099 computer game. Their creators are some of the most talented mapmakers in the Quake community. Working together with id designer Paul Jaquays, Quake3World Level Editing forum moderator Astro Creep, Mr. Elusive, the bot A.I. programmer for both Quake III Arena and Quake III: Team Arena, and Drunken Boxer, Quake3World Capture the Flag and Team Arena forum moderator, these artisans have created some truly fine playgrounds for Team Arena.\n\nPlayers who download user-community made Capture the Flag maps for Quake III Arena will recognize that these are not exactly brand new creations. They already have a bit of history behind them. They were selected for this pack because they had already made their marks as superior virtual playgrounds. Yet a closer look will reveal they are also not the same as the maps originally released for Quake III Arena. More than just adding a few new textures and game entities, these maps have been upgraded, polished, and in some cases radically overhauled. The new versions not only accommodate the new Quake III: Team Arena game styles like Harvester and Overload, but also include the play and appearance improvements that the map makers themselves wanted to see in their maps.\n\nJapanese Castles TA by Mike \u00c2\u0093g1zm0\u00c2\u0094 Burbidge   (japanc_ta.bsp)\n\tFeatures the two Japanese fortresses from g1zm0's original Japanese Castles CTF map, along with caves, bridges and roaring waterfalls. This is a fast, exciting map with a lot of intersecting action.\n\nSchadenfreude TA by Jason \u00c2\u0093Cornelius\u00c2\u0094 Gill (schad_ta.bsp)\n\tWhen we contacted him, Cornelius was already in the process of upgrading the appearance and play of the original Schadenfreude, one of the first community made CTF maps for Quake III Arena. We made a few suggestions for improvements as to how the game might be made to best play Team Arena game types and he turned them into a shiny gemstone of a map.\n\nCrossed Paths v.TA by Dan \u00c2\u0093Drunken Boxer\u00c2\u0094 Lanicek (dbox2_ta.bsp)\n\tDrunken Boxer had already made some changes to his original version of Crossed Paths, making it even more competitive. We helped him set it up for Team Arena play and pointed out a few things he could do to smooth out some of the rough spots.\n\nAn Iteration of TA Hell by John \u00c2\u0093HAL9000\u00c2\u0094 Schuch (hal9000_ta.bsp) \n\tThe Team Arena remake of this map is our token \u00c2\u0093really, really, quite very large\u00c2\u0094 map in this pack. We helped HAL9000 find and fix a few sticky spots in the map, and showed him ways to improve the in-game performance, but structurally, this map is probably the closest to the original.\n\n\nProject History\n\nWell before Quake III: Team Arena was complete, we tossed around the idea of putting out some additional maps for it. Free maps. Our internal resources were still heavily committed to finishing the expansion pack and anxious to be getting onto Doom production. So, we looked to the creative talent of the Quake community. Although the team style maps were not as numerous as free for all and tournament style, we had quite a number to choose from. Using sites like ..::LvL and ZAxis and Spankenstein\u00c2\u0092s Reliquary as referral sources, it didn\u00c2\u0092t take long to find, play, and winnow our way through the most popular team play maps out there.  In this regard, a debt of thanks is owed specifically to Tigger-oN and his brief reviews on his website, ..::LvL (http://www.planetquake.com/lvl/) and the Quake III Arena fans who downloaded the maps and rated them for play quality. That sort of ranking made our lives just that much easier. Maps that looked good, that were balanced, that embodied a design philosophy in keeping with Quake III Arena (as opposed to earlier id CTF style games), that had a layout adaptable to the Q3: TA game types, and that were enjoyable play experiences against bots made the first cut. Before Team Arena was even on the shelves we had a selection of maps that would suit our needs.\n\nThe selected maps were winnowed down through \u00c2\u0093live\u00c2\u0094 play test to a double handful. We approached the designers of those maps and invited them to participate in the project. The response was unanimous.\n\nAt this point some folks outside of id got involved on the production side. Astro Creep, a map maker and moderator of a number of forums at Quake3World (http://www.quake3world.com), including the Level Editing forum and the Team Arena forum worked with me to evaluate and critique each of the maps, suggesting changes to layout, architecture, entity placement, and texture decoration. Drunken Boxer, another mapmaker who moderates the CTF and Team Arena forums at Quake3World provided additional input and counsel. The last step was to run each map past MrElusive, to fine tune the maps for bot play.\n\nAnd yes, there is a Team Arena Map Pack 2 in the works. As with this map pack, announcement of its contents will come at the time of release. Please note that we are not and will not be asking for additional map submissions.\n\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nJanuary 15, 2001\n**********************************************************************\nTeam Arena Model Mesh Art\n\nThe link below will download the installer (with EULA) for the wire mesh art used to create the character skins for the Team Arnea models. Included are the mesh layouts for the two team models (male and female), all 11 character heads, and the mesh layouts for Pi and Fritzkrieg, the two tourney models.\n\nTeam Arena Skin Meshes\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nJanuary 3, 2001\n**********************************************************************\n\nThe latest version of GtkRadiant is available. This new build supports Quake III: Team Arena and contains new editing media from Id. \n\nThe documentation (http://www.qeradiant.com/manual) has been updated with two new items: the terrain manual \n(http://www.qeradiant.com/manual/Terrain_Manual/start.html) and the Team Arena Mapping Help (http://www.qeradiant.com/manual/Team_Arena_Mapping_Help/start.html). We now have everything under HTML format, and the setups contain an offline version.\n\nA few new mapobjects are included in this release:\n- tree models used in TA terrain maps (baseq3/models/mapobjects/tree2)\n- TA spawns (missionpack/models/mapobjects/spawn)\n\nYou now have to select the game in the project settings dialog, set it to Quake III Arena or to Quake III: Team Arena depending on what you want to do. GtkRadiant is fairly different from Id's internal 200f Q3Radiant. It doesn't require copying the Team Arena pak file into your baseq3/ directory. Everything is fully documented on the GtkRadiant start page (http://www.qeradiant.com/gtkradiant.shtml).\n\nWe are tagging this release as a beta because some elements initially planned for version 1.2 have been added. Regular Quake III Arena editing will be more or less the same, but Quake III: Team Arena editing needs more testing.\n\nWe are also looking forward to increase our linux testers team. If you have been using GtkRadiant 1.1 or plan to use this new build on linux, get in touch with Loki: email beta@lokigames.com and check out http://odin.lokigames.com.\n\nThis release will give us the opportunity to open the source for GtkRadiant. Now that we don't have a new release to worry about we will have some time to open the cvs tree, put out some information for new contributors etc. we'll post an update on http://www.qeradiant.com  when it's ready. I wish to thank everyone involved in this last release, I think it was a great achievement. Lots of good work went into it, from a lot of people.\n\nThe main GtkRadiant page is at http://www.qeradiant.com/gtkradiant.shtml \n\nThe primary ftp is at 3ddownloads: http://www.3ddownloads.com/index.php3?directory=/qeradiant/GtkRadiant/ \n\nenjoy!\n\nTTimo\n\n**********************************************************************\n\nThe server batch files for Team Arena were accidentally left off the Team Arena disk.

I say \"for the most part\"\nbecause there is one annoying aspect to the game, and that is the fact that\nthey put some of the dreaded \"jumping\" puzzles into the game.  Luckily, the\nones in this are not near as annoying as ones I've had to deal with in other\ngames, so it really is a minor annoyance.\n\nOne good thing for me in playing this game is the fact that I have not seen\nthe movie yet.  So, the plot that develops over the course of the game was\nall fresh for me.  Given the less than stellar reports I've heard of the\nmovie, I think I might have taken the right approach since I completely\nenjoyed playing this game.\n\nOh, and as an FYI, this is pretty much an action game.  I think some of the\npreviews called it an adventure game, and there are adventure elements such\nas conversation trees and \"find the part\", but you still spend most of your\ntime hacking your way through robots, sand people, and others.\n\nThe adventure element brings me to an interesting observation.  In talking to\npeople I've confirmed how closely the plot of the game follows that of the\nmovie.  It almost seems that the movie was written in such a way that it would\nbe ideally suited for making a game based on the same plot.  I say this because\nof the types of quests that you embarked on in the game.  I won't say any more\nso that I don't spoil things for the other 1 person out there that hasn't seen\nThe Phantom Menace yet.  I just found it interesting how well suited the plot\nof the film was to a game.\n\n4/8/99\n-------\n\nSpam sucks (and I'm not talking about that chopped pig parts stuff in a can\nthat Monty Python sings about).\n\nNow that I've vented that one, Anachronox is kicking ass these days.  We're\ngetting some cool things in the game that will help both the gameplay and\nthe visual appearance of the game.  In addition, I've just gotten the first\nrun at using DirectMusic in the game.  I'm looking forward to having interactive\nmusic in this game.  I was pretty impressed when I was playing Banjo Kazooie on\nthe N64 and I would hear a slow transition in the music when I got near this\npirate ship in the middle of the \"level\".  Little things like that can really\naffect the atmosphere of a game.\n\nI keep thinking about movies like Blade Runner and Last Temptation of Christ\nwhere the music was so subtle, but yet I think it had a direct effect on the\nmood of the movie.  Here's hoping we can achive the same thing.  ;)\n"}, {"by": "petri@remedy.fi", "time": 909435240, "contents": "Username: petri                     In real life: Petri Jarvilehto      \n\n\nPlan:\n[261098]\n\nThis is insane. Futuremark is now releasing 3DMark (it'll be \navailable at www.3dmark.com at 4 pm pacific time), and our \nservers are starting to get maxed out. I mean, we're trying \nto tell everyone when it's available, but still we're already \ngetting so much hits our web-server is begging for mercy even \nthough 3DMark is not out yet... and the hit-count is still climbing.\n\nStill, the work the guys have put into the demo and to the \nbenchmark has been awesome, and they deserve all the credit for \nthe work well done. If you like 3dmark, send them e-mail (the \naddress is info@futuremarkcorp.com) and tell your opinion, (or \neven better, register the full version, I'm sure they'd appreciate \nthat even more :-). Also, some of the Max Payne development team \nguys (especially Henkka, Samppa and Jake) spent their weekends \nworking on some the art and code for 3DMark, in addition to \npulling their weight on Max Payne.\n\nAnyways, if you want to measure your 3D speed, check out some\nof the MAX-FX stuff, or just see a pretty darn cool demo, \ndownload 3DMark and let the Futuremark guys know what you think :)\n\nCheers,\n\nPetri\n\n[151098]\n\nGosh,\n\nThe Futuremark guys (finally) came out of their den (they've been\nusing the conference room for 5 days now, wrapping up the 3D Mark\ndemo) and told that they would let us (the Max Payne team) to see \nwhat they've been up to (they're using MAX-FX in some parts of the \ndemo, so we've naturally been bugging them to let us see how the \nwhole thing turns out).\n\nAll of us rushed to the conference room, we turned out the lights\nand turned on the volume and let the show begin.\n\n...and it's freakin' awesome. I mean, most of us have a background in\nthe demoscene, and we know where demos are at the moment, but seeing\n3D Mark run on a 400 P2 with TNT was totally amazing. It's good.\nIt's darn good. Dunno how much impact this will have on the demo-scene,\nbut hopefully it might draw them out kicking and screaming into the\nage of 3d acceleration.\n\nAnyways, that's all for now, we're off to another brainstorm on Max Payne\nfinal content and design. \n\n\n[131098]\n\nHi all,\n\nJust to clear up some confusion. In a recent article it was mentioned\nthat Max Payne requires a 3D accelerator, a direct quote was: \"with\na 3dfx compatible card\". I've been getting quite many questions on\nthis regard, and to set the thing straight, MAX-FX is running now\non DirectX6.0 and we support pretty much all DX6.0 compatible 3d cards. \nTo run Max Payne properly you'll need a card that is at least as \npowerful as 3DFX generation 1 card, and if you have a faster accelerator,\nyou'll end up getting more visual detail.\n\nAnd some miscellaneous notes:\n\n1) We're not doing any more interviews for the time being. Talking\nwith people is certainly good fun and all, but it's also pretty easy\nto get distracted with all the press etc. We're now going to close \nall the doors, turn off the lights, crank up the volume and do some\nheavy duty game developing for the next 4-5 months... We'll tell\nmore about the game when we're closer to the release, ok? :-)\n\n2) We're very close to getting the new mapper to join us shortly... \nit's been taking longer than expected to get all the practical \nmatters solved out (work permits, place to live etc.), but Marty \nis going to fly from Australia in a week or two. \n\n3) Lately we've been doing huge planning sessions, nailing down the\nfinal content for the game as well as planning out the implementation\nof that content. It's been a pretty good (though exhausting) 3 weeks,\nand we're now confident that the vision we have on the gameplay is\nsomething that we can deliver.\n\n"}, {"by": "pezman@aliensversuspredator.com", "time": 967838820, "contents": "Login: pezman         \t\t\tName: AVP Dude\nDirectory: /usr/home/pezman         \tShell: /usr/local/bin/tcsh\nNever logged in.\nNew mail received Fri Sep  1 17:04 2000 (CDT)\n     Unread since Fri Sep  1 16:07 2000 (CDT)\nPlan:\nWow, it has been a while since I fired this bad boy up, but it looks like now is a great time to wipe the spider webs off of the ol' .plan file.  \n\nSo much has happened since the last update but for today I am going to exclusively focus on NOLF (No One Lives Forever for all of you who live under a rock and don't know it's abbreviation.)

We will feature 4 singleplayer levels in the demo (One of which is a training mission).\n\nThe game is hot, I mean hot!  I am very pleased with the progress that it has made to date and hopefully you will enjoy it also.  Cate Archer is dead sexy, and just looking at a polied out model of her gets the juicies going =).\n\nBut here is the one thing that worries me about the demo, and about the people who are going to play it.  So sit down for a moment and listen to Kyle's story time as I explain one key feature about the game....\n\nWhen playing No One Lives Forever you need to remember one thing.  You are a 60's spy, and you will want to play like one.  If you go through the game ala Quake tactics you will pass the game, but you will miss some of the funniest conversations that the guards have with one another.  The AI in NOLF actually has personality, they chat, they laugh, and most importantly, they are corney.  You can just about get through most of one level without killing a single person.  Keep this in mind!  \n\nSo when you get the demo that we are releasing in the next few hours, be sure to keep in mind that you are going to want to explore the levels and keep your weapons holstered so that you will experience as much of the game as you can.  If you go rampaging through the levels shooting every bad guy in site before he gets to say a word, then I would suggest to you, replaying the demo, as replay value with this demo is very high and enjoyable."}, {"by": "plee@mail.sec-net.com", "time": 900362280, "contents": "User:   plee\nRead:   0\nUnread: 0\nTime:   Mon, 13 Jul 1998 15:27:58 -0700"}, {"by": "plipo@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 1089434880, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Pat Lipo\nEmail: plipo@ravensoft.com\nDescription: Lead Programmer/Prog.

The correct file is WolfMPTEST0915.exe.\n\nBoth versions will work but you will want the later one for some compatibility, performance and other issues.\n\n\n\n\nWolf Notes.\n\nI thought I'd share a bit of information about the Wolf MP Test. Basically some strategies and techniques we use around here.\n\nThe key to Wolf MP is teamwork, you need good class balance to perform the objectives. There is no health on the map, and no ammo either. You will need a Medic to supply health and a Lieutenant to supply ammo. Here is a quick run down on some stuff. More info is in the readme that will accompany the test but this will get you started. Wolf MP was designed to have friendly fire on, you can turn it off but it is much more fun on. \n\nAll classes carry a knife, pistol, 2-handed weapon, grenade(s).\n\nSoldier - Can carry any two handed weapon. ALL classes are limited to one 2 handed weapon at a time. You can drop your weapon and pick up a different one. When you are wielding one of the heavier weapons, Venom, Panzerfaust, you move sllloooww.. but you can move at normal speed if you have your knife or pistol out.\n\nEngineer - Carries half the normal ammo initially can pick up more but starts out with half. Carries dynamite and tools, can defuse dynamite and fix the MG42 mounted guns. \n\nMedic - Carries half the normal ammo initially and only 1 grenade. Can produce health packs based on the charge bar. All the class charge bars are on the right of the hud, the left hand bar is stamina. Also carries a syringe ( with 5 charges ) that can revive fallen comrades. You will see a revive icon over them if it is possible. When you die you can choose to go straight to limbo ( press jump ) or wait for a medic. PAY attention to the reinforcement timer on the scoreboard so you know when to jump to limbo.  Medic's also give a health bonus to your team up to 120, just having 2 medics alive on your team means you spawn in with 110 health instead of 100. Medics are your friend.\n\nLieutenant - Carries smoke grenade which calls in an airstrike, ammo pack ( recharge system like the medic ) and binoculars for calling in artillery. The latter is particularly useful for erradicating enemy snipers that are hard to find. \n\nYou can change classes when you are in limbo and/or change weapons as a soldier. This is important as roles evolve based on what is going on during the game play. \n\nIf you are on the allied team, initially you are going to need an engineer, some snipers, a medic to help get the engineer up the beach. Once you have blown the door and the wall you do not need any more engineers unless you just like blowing stuff up in a major way. If you can capture the forward spawn point in the bunker you will mostly reinforce in there so at this point snipers become less critical. You will want soldiers and at least one medic and lieutentant. It is usually a fight down to the war room and then up to the radio room. \n\nThe axis team is going to want a lieutenant and a sniper or two to start out with. You will want to man the MG42's ASAP so you can chew the beach up and keep the door and wall up as long as possible. You can even get sneaky and have an engineer jump over the wall to defuse the dynamite if you can keep him covered well enough. Once they are inside the base you will want keep a group in the war room and in the radio room. A medic is handy near the radio room to keep people alive during the last push. A good Axis sniper can dominate the beach in the beginning.\n\nThat is just a taste of what is coming your way from a game play perspective. The map is even fun one on one you just have to change classes to win! \n\nOh yeah, USE the SPRINT key, it is really helpful getting your butt outta bad places. Also don't forget the voice chats, called \"Quick\" chat in the menu system.\n\nFor server ops the .script file in the maps directory ( outside the pak file ) contains mission time etc.. 8 Minutes is a good place to start. \n\n\nHave fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 9.2001\n----------\nQCon 2 on 2 SMACK DOWN.\n\nLast year Tim and I had an open challenge in the nVIDIA booth in 2 on 2 CTF. The prizes were T-shirts for the winners. We only lost one out of about 25 matches. This year, we have some great prizes as we figure it is time for us to whip everyone's butt again in 2 on 2 CTF courtesy of nVIDIA and all the QuakeCon sponsers and volunteers.\n\nHere are the details:\n\nThis year we will have two id teams, Tim and myself and Todd and Marty. We will take on any and all 2 person teams in 2 on 2 CTF. Matches will probably be to either 6 or 8 with a 5 minute time limit. This will happen Saturday afternoon and will take place in the nVIDIA booth. If you feel like getting your butt whipped in 2 on 2 CTF, grab a friend and get in line.\n\nWe have some cool prizes this year for everyone.\n\nThe first team that beats one of the id teams gets their choice of either Two GameBoy Advances ( and a game ) or Two GE-Force 3 cards. The 2nd team that wins gets whatever the first team did not choose. The next two winning teams will get framed and signed prints of Team Arena and we will also have T-Shirts and other gizmos and stuff on hand to reward great play and other winning teams.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 2.2001\n----------\n\nLinux 1.29h is up on our FTP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 1.2001.early.evening\n------------------------\n\nThe 1.29h source is up on our ftp under quake3\\source\\. I don't anticipate many if any changes before the 1.30 final.\n\n\n\n\nAug 1.2001\n----------\n\nI am going to get the latest source up for mod teams later today ( it might be late tonight ) but it should appear soon. There should be minimal changes if at all before this turns into a non-beta 1.30.\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 31.2001\n------------\n\nThe 1.29h point release is up. You can auto-update to it from 1.29f or 1.29g or grab the whole sha-bang from our ftp. The Linux version will be up asap. This is STILL a beta, we plan to go final with it after QuakeCon.\n\nChanges\n\n- Fixed Server exploit\n- Fixed Mouse wheel \n- Fixed NT 4.0 Sound\n- FPS Boost\n- in_mouse set to -1 will provide 1.17ish sensitivity, in_mouse set to 1 will provide current sensitivity\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 30.2001\n------------\n\nPoint Release status. \n\nWe have made the fixes we wanted to make to the latest version, including having the proper pak files in the full installer. We did not make any input code changes between 1.29f and 1.29g, but we did link with a different version of Directx ti get NT Sound functioning properly. This fixed NT 4.0 sound but produced an FPS loss on some systems and changed the way input was working as well which allowed in_mouse == -1 to work like some folks like but causes mouse wheel problems under some versions of Intellipoint. We have since done the following:\n\n-Re-linked to a later version of DirectX.\n-Set Directx up to use sound compatible with Directx 3 \n-Made one small tweak to the input code which allows in_mouse to function correctly when set to -1 ( old sensitivity ) this should make both input camps happy.\n-Fixed a potential server crash.\n\nWe are testing this now and should release it in the am.\n\nThanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 28.2001\n------------\n\nThere is an issue if you download the full ( 25MB ) 1.29g install and apply it on top of 1.29f. The installer does not overwrite the existing baseq3\\pak6.pk3 and missionpack\\pak1.pk3. AUTO-UPDATE works just fine so if you have 1.29f it is best to do that anyway as the update is much smaller. The installer also works fine on any version prior to 1.29f. Most people will have just ran auto-update but for those that cannot or don't like auto-updaters can remove the above pak files before running it and it will work fine. \n\nThe game will run either way as the .exe is compatible with either set of pak files. Our install/setup person is out of town until tomorrow night. Once he is back we will get an updated setup that works properly.\n"}, {"by": "raduffy@idsoftware.com", "time": 1037892780, "contents": "Welcome to id Software's Finger Service V1.5!\n\nName: Robert A. Duffy\nEmail: \nDescription: Programmer\nProject: \nLast Updated: 11/21/2002 10:58:03 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNovember.21.2002\n----------------\nThere is a new Linux Q3A 1.32b on the ftp. This is Linux client side only and is fully compatible with 1.32\n\nChanges:\n\n- Text mode install broken on glibc 2.3 (Debian Sid) http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=165358\nCurrent Debian Sid's glibc package break backwards compatibility with binaries compiled on older glibc and statically linked. This will cause the text mode setup to segfault.\n\nFor now you can either:\n - find a solution to run the graphical gtk-based setup\n - roll back to glibc 2.2\n - use an updated setup binary:\n   run the linux setup once, with the --keep option\n     (this will exand all the files to setup.tmp/)\n   get this updated setup file:\n     http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/linux/165358/setup\n   replace setup.tmp/setup.data/bin/Linux/x86/setup by the new one\n   cd to setup.tmp/ and run setup.sh \n\n\n- Current NVidia drivers don't officially support glibc 2.3 systems This affects Debian Sid in particular, causing crashes during vid_restart The issue is related to the SMP build depending upon libpthreads 1.32b has both SMP and non-SMP binary. Use quake3-smp to launch the SMP version if you want to use it.\n\n\n- SMP and non-SMP builds:\nDefault quake3 shortcut will spawn a non-SMP build. Use quake3-smp for an SMP-enabled run. From the feedback we got after the 1.32 release, \nthe SMP support as designed in the Quake III Arena technology isn't so much relevant anymore. It was designed for much lower CPU frequencies and lower AGP throughputs. Modern systems won't benefit from SMP. Since it didn't make much sense to remove the SMP binary, we have both now.\n\n\n- Fixing broken mouse on Suse:\nStarting with XFree 4.2, the event timestamps returned by the X server \nare no longer matching gettimeofday. And there is currently no API in X \nto provide easy synchronisation. 1.32 introduced improved event timing \nby correcting event time with X server event timestamp (sub-frame timing). This worked fine with XFree 4.1, and no longer does. 1.32b adds a safe check to work again with XFree 4.2, but basically the input timing is back to 1.31 quality.\n\nSome new cvars related to the mouse control:\nin_dgamouse - not new, but be sure to have it set to 1 on any recent system in_subframe - completely disables sub-frame timing. If XFree 4.2\n  in_subframe 1 won't hurt, but it won't do anything either.\nin_nograb   - for mod developers. Set to 1 and run windowed, Q3 won't be\n  grabbing your mouse pointer (useful for debug breaks)\n\n\n\n\nOctober.24.2002\n---------------\n\nThe Quake 3 Arena and Quake 3 Team Arena sdk's are up on our ftp.\n\nIn idstuff/quake3/source\n\nWin32 - Q3A_TA_GameSource_132.exe\nLinux - linuxq3a-sdk-1.32.x86.run\n\n\n\n\nOctober.7.2002\n--------------\n\nThe new Quake 3 Arena and Quake 3 Team Arena point release is up.

Basically some strategies and techniques we use around here.\n\nThe key to Wolf MP is teamwork, you need good class balance to perform the objectives. There is no health on the map, and no ammo either. You will need a Medic to supply health and a Lieutenant to supply ammo. Here is a quick run down on some stuff. More info is in the readme that will accompany the test but this will get you started. Wolf MP was designed to have friendly fire on, you can turn it off but it is much more fun on. \n\nAll classes carry a knife, pistol, 2-handed weapon, grenade(s).\n\nSoldier - Can carry any two handed weapon. ALL classes are limited to one 2 handed weapon at a time. You can drop your weapon and pick up a different one. When you are wielding one of the heavier weapons, Venom, Panzerfaust, you move sllloooww.. but you can move at normal speed if you have your knife or pistol out.\n\nEngineer - Carries half the normal ammo initially can pick up more but starts out with half. Carries dynamite and tools, can defuse dynamite and fix the MG42 mounted guns. \n\nMedic - Carries half the normal ammo initially and only 1 grenade. Can produce health packs based on the charge bar. All the class charge bars are on the right of the hud, the left hand bar is stamina. Also carries a syringe ( with 5 charges ) that can revive fallen comrades. You will see a revive icon over them if it is possible. When you die you can choose to go straight to limbo ( press jump ) or wait for a medic. PAY attention to the reinforcement timer on the scoreboard so you know when to jump to limbo.  Medic's also give a health bonus to your team up to 120, just having 2 medics alive on your team means you spawn in with 110 health instead of 100. Medics are your friend.\n\nLieutenant - Carries smoke grenade which calls in an airstrike, ammo pack ( recharge system like the medic ) and binoculars for calling in artillery. The latter is particularly useful for erradicating enemy snipers that are hard to find. \n\nYou can change classes when you are in limbo and/or change weapons as a soldier. This is important as roles evolve based on what is going on during the game play. \n\nIf you are on the allied team, initially you are going to need an engineer, some snipers, a medic to help get the engineer up the beach. Once you have blown the door and the wall you do not need any more engineers unless you just like blowing stuff up in a major way. If you can capture the forward spawn point in the bunker you will mostly reinforce in there so at this point snipers become less critical. You will want soldiers and at least one medic and lieutentant. It is usually a fight down to the war room and then up to the radio room. \n\nThe axis team is going to want a lieutenant and a sniper or two to start out with. You will want to man the MG42's ASAP so you can chew the beach up and keep the door and wall up as long as possible. You can even get sneaky and have an engineer jump over the wall to defuse the dynamite if you can keep him covered well enough. Once they are inside the base you will want keep a group in the war room and in the radio room. A medic is handy near the radio room to keep people alive during the last push. A good Axis sniper can dominate the beach in the beginning.\n\nThat is just a taste of what is coming your way from a game play perspective. The map is even fun one on one you just have to change classes to win! \n\nOh yeah, USE the SPRINT key, it is really helpful getting your butt outta bad places. Also don't forget the voice chats, called \"Quick\" chat in the menu system.\n\nFor server ops the .script file in the maps directory ( outside the pak file ) contains mission time etc.. 8 Minutes is a good place to start. \n\n\nHave fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 9.2001\n----------\nQCon 2 on 2 SMACK DOWN.\n\nLast year Tim and I had an open challenge in the nVIDIA booth in 2 on 2 CTF. The prizes were T-shirts for the winners. We only lost one out of about 25 matches. This year, we have some great prizes as we figure it is time for us to whip everyone's butt again in 2 on 2 CTF courtesy of nVIDIA and all the QuakeCon sponsers and volunteers.\n\nHere are the details:\n\nThis year we will have two id teams, Tim and myself and Todd and Marty.

Duffy\nEmail: \nDescription: Programmer\nProject: \nLast Updated: 07/26/2004 12:48:39 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJuly.26.2004\n------------\n\nI've seen quite a few posts in the forums about \"Ultra\" quality and why we don't set this by default out of the box. I thought I would clarify a few of the reasons and also take the time to mention some of the hardware and software we found incredibly useful during the development of DOOM 3. \n\nTo put things in perspective, most production levels in DOOM 3 contain more media assets than all of Quake 3: Arena. When we started working on the memory foot print, our goal was a 256MB system. In most cases loading up an area of the game on a 256MB system works fine, the problems arise when you start to transition from one area to the next ( successive map loads ). Memory fragmentation starts to really work against us and it ultimately made it just not feasible for a reasonable play experience to support 256MB. \n\nTwo basic options make up the quality levels, sound diversity and image fidelity. \n\nSound diversity is effectively how many sounds we support per sound shader for a given \"sound\". There may be for instance, 7 different \"bullet striking the wall\" sounds for a given bullet. In low quality, we only use one sound for this vs randomly choosing between one of the seven available. When we started on memory optimization, most levels used between 80 and 100 megabytes of sound data. We made the choice to move to .OGG for quite a few sounds which effectively removed the problem for us.\n\nImage fidelity is dependent on what quality level we load the textures at.\n\nIn Ultra quality, we load each texture; diffuse, specular, normal map at full resolution with no compression. In a typical DOOM 3 level, this can hover around a whopping 500MB of texture data. This will run on current hardware but obviously we cannot fit 500MB of texture data onto a 256MB card and the amount of texture data referenced in a give scene per frame ( 60 times a second ) can easily be 50MB+. This can cause some choppiness as a lot of memory bandwidth is being consumed. It does however look fantastic :-) and it is certainly playable on high end systems but due to the hitching that can occur we chose to require a 512MB Video card before setting this automatically. \n\nHigh quality uses compression ( DXT1,3,5 ) for specular and diffuse and no compression for normal maps. This looks very very close to Ultra quality but the compression does cause some loss. This is the quality that for instance the PC Gamer review was played in. \n\nMedium quality uses compression for specular, diffuse, and normal maps. This still looks really really good but compressing the normal maps can produce a few artifacts especially on hard angled or round edges. This level gets us comfortably onto 128MB video cards. \n\nLow quality does everything medium quality does but it also downsizes textures over 512x512 and we downsize specular maps to 64x64 in this mode as well. This fits us onto a 64MB video card. \n\nOne thing of note on the normal map compression is that generally speaking if you DXT a normal map you get really crappy results. NVIDIA hardware supports palettized compression which yields good compression and normal maps retain hard and round edges really well. Unfortunately this compression does a poor job in other cases and you end up getting splotchy areas. ATI does not support the palettized compression so we needed a better solution. ATI had done some research on various methods of normal map compression and we ended swapping the red and alpha ( which is zero in the case of a normal map ) channels. This effectively allows the compression to do a much better job and is just one extra instruction in the fragment program to move the alpha channel into the red channel. The bottom line on what happens on each card is as follows.\n\nAll modern NVIDIA and all ATI hardware use the compressed normal maps in Medium and Low qualities with the swizzled components.\nNV10/20 hardware ( GF4MX and GF3 ) uses palettized normal maps in Medium and Low qualities.\n\nAnother question I have had multiple emails about, yes the game is capped at 60fps for normal game play. For render demos, like what was used for the HARD OCP stuff, we run those at full tilt which is why you will see > 60fps. \n\n\nFor the curious, here is a list of software/hardware we found useful during the development of DOOM 3.\n\nIncredibuild by Xoreax.\nVisual Assist by Whole Tomato Software\nAlienbrain by Avid ( formerly NXN )\nVisual Studio by Microsoft\n\nDOOM 3 was developed mostly on Dell and/or Alienware computers. Falcon also sent us a kick ass system that has been Tim's primary play system through most of the project. \n\nThe art team used a wide variety of tools ( they probably use other stuff too but this is what comes to mind ) \n\nMaya\nLightwave\nZBrush\n3D Max\nPhotoshop\n\nWe saw a few bumps in the road during the project, we had a multiple ( simultaneous ) drive failure in our primary development server which effectively trashed the raid system and was not recoverable. This resulted in building a two IDE drive raid system on a Saturday morning so the team could keep working. So all of DOOM 3 development was housed in an old dev system with a $79 RAID card driving two 100GB drives for about a week. The end result of this was we went ahead and built two identical RAID 1/0 systems ( about a half a terabyte each ). This has been the configuration for the last 18 months or so. \n\nWe made the move to Alienbrain about two thirds into the project. It was a big change for everyone as no one but the programmers were used to having to \"check something out\" to work on it. Overall this was a big win for the project as it centralized everything into one application from an asset/code standpoint. Alienbrain like any major software system has a few gotchas but has performed very well and sustained our RAID running entirely out of drive space multiple times. \n\n\nI hope everyone enjoys the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril.30.2004\n-------------\n\nWe are looking for a Tools Programmer. The position will be full time and will require relocating to the Dallas Texas area. Responsibilities will include the design and implementation of a wide variety of tools for game creation. Specific focus will be on level editing capabilities and game design and implementation mechanics. You will be required to work closely with the programming, design and art teams on the design of tools for DOOM 3 tech as well as future tech. \n\nRequirements:\n-At least 5 years of extensive C and C++ experience. \n-Extensive OpenGL experience.\n-Demonstrable experience with tool creation on a recent or current game. \n-Excellent overall technical and communications skills. \n-MFC experience is a plus but not strictly required.\n\n-International applicants will need to have a 4 year degree.\n\nInterested parties please send a cover letter and resume to raduffy@idsoftware.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 4.0.2003\n--------------\n\nThe Enemy Territory master server is down. ETA is a few hours before it is back up.\n\n\n\n\nSeptember.9.2003\n----------------\n\n\nUpdated setups for Q3 Linux 1.32 and RTCW Linux 1.41 are available in the anonymous ftp ( ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com ) and on the BitTorrent tracker ( http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/BT/ ).\n\n6eb06cb2c21f075f8cd63901d43ba7a3  linuxq3apoint-1.32b-2.x86.run 6edf02471da704ad4e9e365e474bcbc8  wolf-linux-1.41-2.x86.run\n\nIMPORTANT: This is NOT a new release, this is an update of the installer code to fix recent bugs related to text mode installation on glibc 2.3 systems. If you already have Q3 1.32b or RTCW 1.41 working on Linux, you don't need to download, the game binaries are strictly the same.\n\n\n\n\nNovember.21.2002\n----------------\nThere is a new Linux Q3A 1.32b on the ftp. This is Linux client side only and is fully compatible with 1.32\n\nChanges:\n\n- Text mode install broken on glibc 2.3 (Debian Sid) http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=165358\nCurrent Debian Sid's glibc package break backwards compatibility with binaries compiled on older glibc and statically linked. This will cause the text mode setup to segfault.\n\nFor now you can either:\n - find a solution to run the graphical gtk-based setup\n - roll back to glibc 2.2\n - use an updated setup binary:\n   run the linux setup once, with the --keep option\n     (this will exand all the files to setup.tmp/)\n   get this updated setup file:\n     http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/linux/165358/setup\n   replace setup.tmp/setup.data/bin/Linux/x86/setup by the new one\n   cd to setup.tmp/ and run setup.sh \n\n\n- Current NVidia drivers don't officially support glibc 2.3 systems This affects Debian Sid in particular, causing crashes during vid_restart The issue is related to the SMP build depending upon libpthreads 1.32b has both SMP and non-SMP binary. Use quake3-smp to launch the SMP version if you want to use it.\n\n\n- SMP and non-SMP builds:\nDefault quake3 shortcut will spawn a non-SMP build. Use quake3-smp for an SMP-enabled run. From the feedback we got after the 1.32 release, \nthe SMP support as designed in the Quake III Arena technology isn't so much relevant anymore. It was designed for much lower CPU frequencies and lower AGP throughputs. Modern systems won't benefit from SMP. Since it didn't make much sense to remove the SMP binary, we have both now.\n\n\n- Fixing broken mouse on Suse:\nStarting with XFree 4.2, the event timestamps returned by the X server \nare no longer matching gettimeofday. And there is currently no API in X \nto provide easy synchronisation. 1.32 introduced improved event timing \nby correcting event time with X server event timestamp (sub-frame timing). This worked fine with XFree 4.1, and no longer does. 1.32b adds a safe check to work again with XFree 4.2, but basically the input timing is back to 1.31 quality.\n\nSome new cvars related to the mouse control:\nin_dgamouse - not new, but be sure to have it set to 1 on any recent system in_subframe - completely disables sub-frame timing. If XFree 4.2\n  in_subframe 1 won't hurt, but it won't do anything either.\nin_nograb   - for mod developers. Set to 1 and run windowed, Q3 won't be\n  grabbing your mouse pointer (useful for debug breaks)\n\n\n\n\nOctober.24.2002\n---------------\n\nThe Quake 3 Arena and Quake 3 Team Arena sdk's are up on our ftp.\n\nIn idstuff/quake3/source\n\nWin32 - Q3A_TA_GameSource_132.exe\nLinux - linuxq3a-sdk-1.32.x86.run\n\n\n\n\nOctober.7.2002\n--------------\n\nThe new Quake 3 Arena and Quake 3 Team Arena point release is up.

Well, now that Gruntz is almost on the shelves and I'm on our next \"secret\" project, I can make some time for an update.  I hope that everyone likes the game and I'm sure that it will provides tons of entertainment for just about everyone.  This game allowed Aaron Carlson and I to really put some \"pizazz\" into the little in-game Grunt animations.  We totally had a blast overexaggerating the movement of the little fella's actions.  Nothing like a big whopping smack on the head from one of the Clubz.  Not to the mention the poor grunt on the receiving end of it.  \n\n\"The Other Game\" news:  \n\nAt the moment, I'm modeling and animating stuff.  I'm aiming for some realistic models and actions and this takes a lot of tweaking to get things just right.  It's really hard to talk about a game that is still \"behind closed doors\" so I'll just have to leave it at that.  Sorry.4/23/98\n\nIt seems as though I broke away from my duties to keep the public informed with my progress.  Riot is looking pretty exceptional right now and I can't wait until everyone gets the chance to join in on all the fun that we've been having putting the game together.  I'm really amazed how all the pieces of the puzzle are fitting together to create an awesome look and feel. Right now, I am slowly recovering from a harddrive fiasco that we had over the weekend.  The good news is that no matter how good things looked the first time you do it, it almost always looks better when you have to redo the work over again.  I'm pretty much off the Riot project at the present because I moved over to the GRUNTZ team doing cinematics and in-game animation.  I'm still lending a hand, when I can, in the Riot cinematics because Pete has pretty much been the lone crusader while getting everything done within the current time parameters. Whew, and it's almost complete!!!! :)\n\n\n\n\n1/20/98\n\nThe cinematics are going great and the Riot team is brewing up some interesting effects for your viewing pleasure.  I hope your eyes don't pop out from the overload of visual stimulus.  Good luck.\n\n\n1/8/98\n\nI've been recovering from the Xmas break and the New Years festivities so I'll make a plan file as soon as I get the chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n"}, {"by": "ricko@garagegames.com", "time": 1015768020, "contents": "GarageGames plan resource for Rick Overman\nPosted Monday January 14, 2002 at 4:07 GMT\nUse the link to see the HTML version of the plan along with any posted\ncomments: http://www.garagegames.com?sec=mg&mod=resource&page=view&qid=1975\n\nIt is very exciting for me to finally announce the launch of [b]Development Snapshots[/b] here at GarageGames.com.

I don't know why I'm doing this either, but here goes.\n\n\nNeed For Speed: Porsche Unleashed:\n\nThe beautiful game is back! Thank you EA for returning the franchise back to what was once known as the greatest racing game ever made. I can't help but think that this game would be the answer to Gran Turismo, had it not been restricted to a single manufacturer, and had more attention been paid to the \"Evolution\" mode.\n\nThe physics engine is finely balanced between simulating the things that need to be simulated, and leaving out those that distract from the \"fun factor\". Hooking up a Logitech WingMan Formula Force, with a set of Takstar Feedback headphones, this game immerses like no other.\n\nMy suggestion to EA, would be to open up the \"Evolution\" mode more like Gran Turismo, so you start with a bit of cash, and can choose what you want to do with it. Provide a big new & used market of cars to buy and sell, a bunch of races with varying prize money, and I would really like to see the ability to challenge street thugs to a one-on-one, with either a fixed amount or the cars up for grabs. Basically this would just mean providing a wider range of cars, and altering the interface.. the racing modes are already there.\n\nFinal suggestion (plea?) is to release a patch so that traffic can be enabled in multiplayer racing. This was a MAJOR drawcard for the original game, and adds huge amounts to the replay factor, since you are forced to pay less attention to the road and surroundings, and more on the traffic. It's nice to see internet/IP support, but without traffic, she ain't what she used to be.\n\n\nCounter-Strike:\n\nThis game rocks. It's hard to even attempt to think of it as a mod, but it's just amazing. A few balance issues prevent it from being my idea of a \"perfect game\", but that's no doubt a matter of opinion, and is nowhere near as strong as my admiration for it.\n\nMy hat goes off to those associated with the project.\n\n\nNBA 2k (Dreamcast):\n\nFinally someone has stepped up and announced to the world that NBA Live is NOT the definative NBA game. Being a big hoops fan, I've tried every NBA game that's been released. Let me tell you, NBA 2k is the biggest step forward in a long time. NBA Drive 2000 (Microsoft) was a very good attempt, and my hat goes off to that team for going the simulation route. I would much rather see Drive 2000 evolve than the long stagnant Live series, however NBA 2K eclipses them all for both visuals and intensity.\n\nI'm not sure how long the affection will last, considering the arcadish influence, but the graphic detail is amazing, and the game is true to the NBA \"experience\", if short of recreating the \"actual\" game (like Drive 2000). I would recommend any hoops fans check this out at some stage.\n\n\nAs a developer, a lot of my inspiration and drive comes from experiencing games the way I would like others to experience ours. These are fine examples of games that make being a developer that much more exciting.\n\n\n27-03-2000\n-------------\n\nKingpin:\n\nI've gone and compiled a dedicated Linux Kingpin v1.21 binary set, it\nis available at:\n\nhttp://impact.frag.com/ridah/kptest/kpded-linux-glibc-i386-v120-to-v121-patch.zip\n\nSince Interplay have locked Kingpin at v1.21, I decided to roll back the changes\nand release a linux v1.21. This should be the final Kingpin release, assuming there\nare no issues with this Linux release.\n\nWhy no Linux client release? I didn't have enough time to work on the Linux client since\nv1.20, so considering the only fixes since then are server-side only, it wouldn't\nmake sense to release a new Linux client, only to have the existing problems get reported\nagain. The v1.20 Linux client should be fully compatible with v1.21 servers, so if it works\nfor you, you should be fine.\n\nThe other remaining issue, is the lack of Linux compilables in the SDK, for the files\nthat were omitted from the game source. I have placed these files, along with an example\nMAKEFILE in the following package:\n\nhttp://impact.frag.com/ridah/kptest/kingpinSDK-v121-navlib-linux-glibc-i386.zip\n\nThe MAKEFILE included is the one I use to build the full source, so you'll need to\nmodify it so that it only tries to build the game source.\n\n-------------\n\nIn an effort to summarise the current (final?) Kingpin releases, here is a list of\nlinks to up-to-date versions and releases:\n\nKingpin v1.21 Patch for Windows (patches any version below v1.21)\nhttp://impact.frag.com/ridah/kptest/kingpin_v121_patch.exe\n\nKingpin v1.20 Patch for Linux:\nhttp://impact.frag.com/ridah/kptest/kingpin-1.20_glibc-i386-linux2.0.tar.gz\n\nKingpin v1.20 for Linux to Kingpin Dedicated Server v1.21 for Linux Patch:\nhttp://impact.frag.com/ridah/kptest/kpded-linux-glibc-i386-v120-to-v121-patch.zip\n\nKingpin SDK v1.21 for Windows/Linux (Linux requires addition package):\nhttp://impact.frag.com/ridah/kptest/Kingpin_SDK_121.zip\n\nKingpin SDK v1.21 Additional Linux files\nhttp://impact.frag.com/ridah/kptest/kingpinSDK-v121-navlib-linux-glibc-i386.zip"}, {"by": "riscchip@nihilistic.com", "time": 971452800, "contents": "Nihilistic Software\nwww.nihilistic.com\n\nUser Name.........riscchip\nFull Name.........Carson Utz\nLast NT Logon.....Thursday, October 12, 2000 at 10:18\n\n10/13/2000\n\nEarly next week Nihilistic Software will be moving from our old, overly \"intimate\" accomodations to a new bigger, badder, better building down the road.

I'm not alone here. There are a number of web sites with forums designed for solving this problem specifically, like www.adcritic.com and The Add Man.\n\nWell, I've reached a new level of frustration with a recent commercial for Citibank, or Citi.com to be specific. The add shows a guy standing outside playing the ukelele and singing. You've probably seen it and payed it no heed. However, in my case, I've got the song the guy is singing stuck in my head.\n\nOnce again, I'm not alone. There are numerous posts here and there on various forums asking about the song. Nobody has been able to identify it yet. This is probably because the song is not part of a post-production recorded soundtrack, but being performed by the actor in the commercial itself. The song probably existed before the commercial--just an intuition on my part--but might have been written for the commercial. \n\nAny information leading to the identification of this song and the name of the original performer would be greatly appreciated: the company that produced the commercial, the guy in the commercial, the director, the actor(singer), etc.\n\nThe lyrics in the commercial are:\n\n\"Why fly to Kauai when you can be with me in Waikiki?\"\n\nAny info?

I know Jim said this a few days back in his .plan, but I am totally excited by what I am reading from everyone who saw Alice at E3. It is SO great to see so many people happy with our product, and the team is looking forward to making this game the best game we can for all of you out there. With that said I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who took the time out to see Alice and review it at E3, it really helps give us a feel for if we are going in the right direction.\n\nIf you have no idea what E3 coverage I am talking about then you can go to \"Dark Places\" at  http://alice.stomped.com and get links to all of the Alice E3 coverage, as well as interviews and screenshots from the team. \n\nI'd also like to thank the crew over at Dark Places for supporting us since day one, and also for finding another Alice fan site.

Personally, i believe that the\nperson with the most amount of time spent in a map deserves credit.\n\nAnd about the latest Daikatana ads in the magazines: sorry if i offended\nyour tender sensibilities by telling you i'm gonna make you my bitch. :)\n\n\nDecember 11, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nI want to update on 2 important topics that just\nhappened to coincide within days of each other.\n\n-----------------\nTopic #1: Quake 2\n\nBefore i say anything, you simply MUST go out and\nbuy yourself a copy of Quake 2, a Monster 3D\nvideo card and a P200 (just in case you have a\nslower system :)\n\nI was pretty skeptical of the Q2Demo that was\nreleased last month, mostly because of the 10hz\ninput problem and the fact that the sound fx\nwere pretty bad.  Of course, i'm not going to\nupdate my .plan to tell everyone that i didn't\nlike the demo.  We're all pretty .plan political\nthese days. :)\n\nBut as soon as Quake 2 was released i ran out\nand bought some copies, put on the headphones,\nturned out the lights, set the GL mode and\nset forth on my long journey...\n\nOh my god.\n\nQuake 2 is the most impressive game i've ever\nplayed on a computer.\n\nMind you, i have a different viewpoint than\nanyone out there. Some people have argued this\npoint with me, saying that DOOM definitely had\na more profound impact than Quake 2.  I never\ngot to see DOOM spring forth from the nether\nregions of the internet, seemingly out of\nnowhere, like everyone else on the planet.\nTherefore, it couldn't have as profound an\neffect on me.\n\nQuake 2's graphics are simply amazing. The\ncolored lighting MAKES this game.  If you're\nplaying the game in software (non-GL), no WAY\nis Q2 going to blow you completely away.\n[I'm so excited to get Daikatana running under\nthe Q2 engine!  We have the source code right\nnow and preliminary tests look awesome!]\n\nI've heard some negative discussion on the Net\nregarding the CD music, but i TOTALLY LOVE IT!\nPlaying Q2 with the music really gets your\nadrenaline pumping!  I wish i knew the names\nof the songs, because my favorite song is\ntrack 6.  Wow.  I'm a guitar junkie, hardcore.\n\nI'm a map designer at heart and the levels in\nQuake 2 are the most beautifully architected\nalternate realities i've ever experienced.\nThey are so much better than Quake 1's maps\nthat i'm almost embarassed to see my earlier\nwork and say that it's still good. The\nmajority of the maps were created by Tim Willits,\nthe lead designer on the project.  Tim did\n22 of the maps and had a hand in the other\n17 maps that were created by American, Brandon,\nJaquays and Xian.  Awesome work, Tim!\n\nThe level textures, models and animations\ndone by Adrian, Kevin and Steed are just\namazing and really create a cohesive, dark\nmood throughout the entire game.  No other\ncompany has thus far matched id's trademark\ngrungy, dark, hardcore art style.\n\nQ2 deathmatch rules.  The weapon balance is\nso much better than Q1.  id definitely copied\nDOOM in this area (among other areas) and the\nresults are magnificent.  No more Q1 deathmatch\nfor me -- Q2 all the way, baby.  (Although\ni think the rocket launcher should have a\nlarger radius of damage and go a slight bit\nfaster.  And maybe a better sound effect.  Ok,\ni'm being nit-picky. :)\n\nI've already beaten the game and am going to\ndo it all over again this weekend.  This is\ndefinitely not something i do with every game,\nbut when you are profoundly affected by a\ngame like Quake 2, you want to experience it\nall over again.  Then maybe once more.\n\nAfter you play Quake 2, you need to ask yourself\nthis question, especially if you are a super-\ncritical 3D shooter nitpicker:\n\nWhat game have you played lately that was\nbetter than Quake 2?\n\nI predict the answer is none.\n\n------------\nSome of you out there may be interested in this\ninformation, so here's a list of the Quake 2 maps\nand who created them.

So much time\nspent inside that world, so much energy\nexpended on the creation of data for DOOM and\nthe destruction of opponents in deathmatch.\n\nEven this long after DOOM's release, there is\nan active community that continues to support\nthe game.  Daily news updates, new levels\nbeing created, new graphics, music and sprites\nare still being made to extend DOOM beyond\nanything we ever imagined.\n\nThere's a lot of interesting information on\nDOOM out there that a lot of you may have never\nseen, such as the very first screenshots of DOOM\nthat i ever released, the earliest pirated\nalphas of the game, the infamous leaked beta,\netc.  Lots of stuff has accumulated and now is\na good time to check it out.\n\nI've picked a few sites to represent them all\nbecause they seem to have the most interesting\ninformation out there on DOOM.\n\nFunctional Entropy:\nhttp://entropy.telefragged.com/index2.html\n(great site, even though they aren't excited\nabout any of Ion Storm's games...yet)\n\nArcane DOOM Stuff:\nhttp://www.trailerpark.com/tequila/killough/doom.html\n(Awesome historical information!)\n\nWith the imminent release of the DOOM source\ncode, a flurry of activity in the DOOM scene is\ntaking place.  After GLDOOM is completed, people\nwill once again inhabit the world of DOOM on\nthe latest 3D video hardware and perhaps inspire\nsome to relive the experience all over again...\n\nLong live DOOM!\n\n\nNovember 11, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nYep, got beat down last night by Joey in DOOM II.\nNaTaS was training him and he did a great job,\nbut tonight Joey is going to be facing his very\nworst fears up close and personal when we go at\nit again.\n\nJust got my Wild Arms soundtrack CD -- sounds\npretty awesome!\n\nCurrently reading Rendevous With Rama.\n\n\nNovember 10, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nYou know a movie is a big success when you have\nhalf your company breaking into discussion/arguing\ngroups for a few hours immediately after returning\nfrom the local Cinemark.\n\nMy opinion: Starship Troopers rocks the house down,\nhardcore!  Sure, the plot is a loaf and the acting\nis passable, but who cares?  Every movie that you\ngo to has decent acting and interesting plots. What\ndoes ST have that all other movies don't have?\n\nHardcore FX and hardcore action.  This movie is a\nperfect personification of DOOM -- it's the blunt,\nexplosive, manic experience of the movie that really\nblows you away.  Not some amazing plot or breakthrough\nacting by a newcomer vying for an Oscar.  It's a\nbone-breaking, badass action thrillfest.  When\nsomeone dies, the camera doesn't pan away at the\nlast minute -- it zeros in on the death and shows\nit in all its gory glory!  GIBFEST!\n\nJust the way I like it.  This entire movie is all\nabout the action and FX, nothing else.  And the FX\nare the best I've ever seen, period.\n\nThe movie that I'm waiting for that I expect to\nhave a lot of integrity in its plot, acting and FX\nis Alien Resurrection.  I expect Aliens+.  But\nwith Starship Troopers, I wasn't expecting much\nbut instead got blown away, hardcore.\n\n\nNovember 3, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nThe Frag was cool.  A bunch of guys took some time\nout and came over to Ion Storm to play some hardcore\nDOOM II deathmatch for a few hours (Blue, Joost,\nOneThumb, etc.)  Very fun.\n\nAbout the AoE review: since I'm not a \"realtime\nstrategy nut\", I guess you shouldn't take my advice\nunless you keep your head in first-person shooters.\nAt least that's what Steve Bauman at Strategy Plus\nthinks.  HE should know a good RTS, not me.\n\nBTW: I've never been paid to endorse anything.  My\nendorsements came from my believing that the product\nwas good.  I don't use a WingMan Warrior, but it's\na good thing for people who can't play simultaneously\nwith a keyboard and mouse.  I like AoE, not because\nI'm friends with Ensemble, but because Bruce Shelley\n(and to a lesser extent, Sandy Peterson) created a\nvery well-balanced Warcraft2/Civ-style RTS game.\n\nHad my \"description\" changed.  I didn't set it that\nway in the first place, MIS did.\n\n\nNovember 1, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nI'm sorry and embarassed about the .plan war that\nhappened yesterday.  We should never have responded\nto Paul's latest update and I offer my apologies\nto the great gaming community that had to sit and\nwatch their favorite game companies act like children.\n\nThis should not happen again.  I have the utmost\nrespect for John Carmack, Adrian Carmack, Kevin\nCloud and the other people who worked long and hard\non Quake 2.  I know that people's perception of\na company is partly based on the .plan file updates\nand I don't want anyone thinking that Ion Storm\nis of low quality based on low quality .plan info.\n\nI can't wait to play Quake 2.  Ship it!\n\n\nSeptember 23, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nI have never been a realtime strategy nut, I'm mostly\na first-person action hardcore gamer.  I played C&C\na little bit last year, but I wasn't really impressed\ntoo much with it and didn't really pursue checking\nout any other \"hot\" RTS titles.\n\nI just played the beta of Age of Empires and it is\na truly awesome game.  Sure, you start out picking\nberries, farming, chopping down trees, etc.  But when\nyou build your civilization up to the point where you\nenter a new age (Tool Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age), it's\nawesome how much more you can do.  This game does\ncivilization development and warfare (land & sea) very\nwell.  There are numerous multiplayer options and a\nscenario editor is included, written by our very own\nMickey Kawick.  The CD music is very cool as well.\nJust playing the title track makes me want to start\nup a new game and destroy someone's civilization!\nGo out and buy Age of Empires from Microsoft,\ndeveloped by our buds over at Ensemble Studios here\nin Dallas.\n\nCheck out this review:\nhttp://www.ogr.com/previews/age_of_empires.shtml\n\n!! Beware The Romero Factor !!\n\n\nMay 31, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nMan, i'm moving my .plan over to html pretty soon. :)\n\nDaikatana has the exact same type of randomized spawn\nspots that Q2 will have: find all spots where the least\namount of people are and pick a random one of those\nfound.  Note that picking up your backpack after you\nrespawn is only cool if your killer is nowhere near it,\nwhich is about 5% of the time.  Thus, uncool.\n\n\nMay 12, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nGot the Froginator animating and it looks really\nexcellent!  It's the first model that we have\nproperly animated in the game so far.\n\n\nMay 7, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nWhoa, long break away from updating the .plan!\n\nDaikatana is rocking along very well, the E3 demo\nis gonna be really cool.\n\nI'm a bit disappointed that Hexen 2 is being\nnamed just that.  I thought that Hecatomb would\nhave been a really great name and carried the\nnaming convention of the series to a logical end.\nDoesn't this sound great: Heretic, Hexen, Hecatomb?\nHeretic, Hexen, Hexen 2.  Whatever. :(\n\n\nApril 2, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nThat was a great April Fool's joke yesterday, eh?\nNo WAY is Onethumb working here! HA HA HA HA HA!\n\n\nApril 1, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nI've had a great idea for another game i'd like\nto develop and i've asked OneThumb, who is a\ngreat idea guy, to head up the project with me\nas Executive Producer.  It's in a different\ngenre than our other games and is going to rock!\n\n\nMarch 31, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nWent muddin' in my brand-new fly-yellow Hummer.\nScared some dudes on the Dallas Tollway, i think.\n\n\nMarch 28, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nWhoa.  I didn't feel *too* sorry for Carmack after\nhearing that his F40 got tapped by a truck since\nhe left a massively expensive Ferrari parked outside\nall day.  But after i found out the extent of the\ndamage and how much it will cost to fix, i now\nfeel pretty bad.  I would hate to have to pay for\nthat amount of random damage.  That does suck.\n\n\nMarch 25, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nThe F40 got hit. Carma.\n\n\nMarch 24, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nThe only stuff left to create are all the\nartifacts.  The design doc should be done Friday.\n\nThe www-book Halcyon Days is finished. Check out\nthis URL: http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon.html\n\nI'm gonna miss Abrash, he's a great guy and an\namazing codesmith.\n\n(File last updated on Thu 11 Dec 1997 at 23:35)\n"}, {"by":

:)\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nApril 26, 2000\nIf\nyou're having trouble getting Daikatana to run with the Diamond Viper II (S3\nSavage 2000 processor), the new Viper 2 95005 drivers released Monday fix your\nproblems.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nApril 22, 2000\nAs\nper the readme.txt in the Daikatana Demo:\u00c2\u00a0 My god, it's finally\nfinished.\u00c2\u00a0 And I thought working on a game for 1.5 years was\nlong....wow.\u00c2\u00a0 I wish everyone would take a nice, objective look at the game\nand not base their criticisms on hype, but on play value and what we've worked\nto achieve: a really fun single-player experience.\u00c2\u00a0 We did not develop\nDaikatana to take on Quake 3 or UT, but we put multiplayer in the game because I\nreally like my single-player games multiplayerable.\u00c2\u00a0 Is that a new\nword?\u00c2\u00a0 :)\n\u00c2\u00a0There\nhave been a few technical issues with the demo that you can fix or workaround\nwith the following information:\n(Q1)\nMultiplayer is laggy or extremely choppy.\n(A1)\nThe server should have its CONNECT RATE turned up to T1/LAN (in\nthe Multiplayer Menu).\u00c2\u00a0 Make sure your client connect rate is turned up as\nwell.\n(Q2)\nDaikatana doesn't work with a Voodoo2.\n(A2)\nThere are two fixes for this: (1) edit your config file (in the DATA\nsubdirectory) and change \"opengl32\" to \"3dfxgl\" or\n\"3dfxvgl\", (2) download and install the miniGL driver from\u00c2\u00a0\nhttp://www.3dfxgamers.com/view.asp?PAGE=V2drivers\n(Q3)\nRunning the DKDEMO.EXE on Windows 2000 gives you an error (Insert\nDisk 1)\n(A3)\nUse WINZIP to extract the DKDEMO.EXE file, then run the SETUP.EXE\nprogram to install the demo\n(Q4)\nThe game pauses for a long time when you're playing multiplayer (seems like a\nlockup)\n(A4)\nThis is a bug in the demo only that occurs when you are attempting to\nconnect to the Catacomb level (Greek time period).\u00c2\u00a0 Just wait 20\nseconds and you'll connect.\n(Q5)\nThe game is too dark\n(A5)\nCheck out the README.TXT file, it has some useful tips.\nSo\nfar, these cover 99% of the problems that people are having.\u00c2\u00a0 I'd like to\nsay thanks to everyone who has been emailing me their raves and congrats --\nthanks a lot, you guys make it all worth it.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nDecember 10, 1999\nIt\nwas six short years ago, down to the hour.\u00c2\u00a0 I remember staying up the last\n30 hours doing exhaustive testing before Jay Wilbur uploaded the shareware\nversion of DOOM to the University of Wisconsin's FTP site.\u00c2\u00a0 We couldn't get\nin -- too many people were sitting on the site, waiting for our upload.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe target directory was full of bogus files with names like \"when.is.it.coming\"\nand \"hurry.up.id\", but finally we got the sysop to up the connect\nlimit to 250 and we barely got in.\u00c2\u00a0 After that upload, things changed.\nI\nremember the crazy lockup bug we had the day before -- if DOOM sat running for\ntoo long, it would just lock up.\u00c2\u00a0 Turned out to be a value that was being\nincremented by the 140-tic-per-second timer function that was wrapping around\n(it takes a very long time for a LONG to wrap, even at\n140-tics-per-second,\u00c2\u00a0 but this one was uninitialized so it took even less\ntime).\u00c2\u00a0 So, we finished it up and sent it out, just knowing everyone would\nhave a lot of fun with it.\u00c2\u00a0 Happy Birthday, DOOM.\nI\nforgot to mention three birthdays in the past few months, the birthdays of

GTE to show up to install my ADSL, so I thought I would share some quick thoughts with you.\n\n1 - Q3A ROCKS! I know that's not earth shattering new information, but I can't help saying it anyway. Thanks to id for bringing back the plasma gun - I really love that thing :)\n\n2 - People who think that \"news\" means reporting every tragedy they can find, regardless of how remote the location, are the lowest form of life. That kind of \"news\" is just laziness. Why not do some real investigative reporting of important issues that we can actually do something about?\n\n3 - The cause of crime is criminals. I laugh at any other explanation. What makes a criminal then? That's an extremely deep subject, so I won't even attempt to get into it, but let me say this. Video games and movies do not make criminals. Violent crime has existed since the beginning of mankind. Let's all get past this nonsensical search for blame and spend more time building our families.\n\n04/13/99 2:20 pm\n\nMy taxes are done! Man I pay entirely too much money to the gov :(\n\nOn a more positive note, here's a couple of recommendations to you gamers out there.\n\nWith all the hype over Voodoo 3, there are some really good deals available for Voodoo 2 cards. If you already have a decent 2D card, you can buy 2 Voodoo 2 cards basically for the price of 1. I just bought 2 Guillemot Maxi Gamer 3D II cards (12M) for only $78 each after rebate. The rebate deal is good til the end of April. For straight Glide performance on a Pentium 2 processor, the Voodoo 3 has nothing over Voodoo 2 SLI mode with 2 cards. That also leaves your AGP slot free for a TNT2 card *hint* *hint* :)\nCheck PriceWatch or other similar sites for the best deals.\n\nIf you love racing games and driving simulations, you really need to check out the new force feedback controllers. I bought the Microsoft Sidewinder Racing Wheel and I have not been able to pry myself away from it. My favorite racing games at the moment are Need for Speed III and Motorhead; I recommend them as well :)\n\nI must hype my favorite site of course, Webdog Plan and News Tracker, and a newcomer to the scene, GamesPlayer. Go check em out :)\n\n\n7/17/98 12:10 pm\n\nI just finished recording 2 cds in 2 days - *whew*.\nI think we may have set a record for the most marches ever recorded in 9 hours. Check out DWS home page for details.\n\nI also spent one of my breaks with the good folks over at Ritual. Thanks to Onethumb for showing me around. I'm not much for hype so I'll just say one little thing. \n\nSiN - buy it.\n\n7/12/98 9:30 pm\n\nThanks to all of you with such positive remarks about QBS. This nifty utility just keeps getting better and better because of your wonderful feedback and suggestions. \n\nIf you have ever considered having your own website, check out Gibbed.com today for the hippest, fastest way to get hooked up. These guys have their act together :)\n\nLastly, I have decided to move on to a new position, and won't be working for Travelocity any longer. I say this just to let you know that my email might back up a bit over the next few weeks, which is a rare thing for me :) I would give you details about what I am doing next, but it would bore you to tears ;)\n\nNext update: the answer to life, the universe, and everything - and no, it has nothing to do with rats, dolphins, or scrabble ;)\n\n7/5/98 10:45 am\n\nThanks to Ryan Nunn of the TFEIQM Quake 2 TC for pointing out the simple fix for making the Fifth Element demo work. The solution is that the CD starts with the folder \"fifth\" containing all of the files in the zip, instead of in the root like the zip file. \n\nStill seeking Susan, but not desperately... ;)\n\n7/5/98 3:00 pm\n\nJust a couple of things today. First, I downloaded that 5th Element game demo and was unable to make it work, either with FakeCD or with burning a real CD. Anyone who has done this successfully, I would appreciate greatly an email explaining how :) \n\nFYI, half of the 34M download was a nice .avi with music from the Diva. The game looks very \"playstationish\" if you know what I mean - but it looks to be fun anyway. I just rented this movie a week ago, and I can tell you one thing - the guy who modelled LeeLoo did some Lara Croft like enhancements ;) Not that Milla Jovovich isn't a fine specimen in her own right, but man there's a wiggle in her animation that just wasn't in the movie :)\n\nFinally, it's a long shot, but I have been looking for an old friend, Susan Lavendar, originally from Earl, North Carolina. Anyone who knows what she's up to these days, I would appreciate a heads up. \n\n\n7/2/98 1:00 pm\n\nChaos hit it right on the head. If you can't get your work done in a reasonable time, and still get home to have a real life, then you are either in over your head or just lazy. I know all about the pitfalls of devoting too much time to non-productive activity. Life is too short and time is too precious to be wasted. Hope you enjoy the cartoon - I have it printed out and taped up on every monitor I own (right next to the pictures of my kids :)\n\n\n7/1/98 2:30 pm\n\nThe main finger page has undergone a small redesign which you should find pleasant :)\n\nLook for great things from QBS in the near future ...\n\nBabies are still cool :)\n\nOh and here's a rumor for any gossip pages reading - there might be a Solo appearance at the upcoming QuakeCon CPL ...\n\n3/16/98 1:59 am\n\nBabies are so cool :)\n\nRonSolo (with a little assistance from wife Leslie) utilizes the advances of modern technology to jump the realms of virtual reality and actually spawn an entity into real space!\n\nThe precious new entity, Claire Ruth Crisco, weighs in at 8 lbs 4 ozs, and a slim, trim 20 inches tall. Mom and baby are both healthy, happy, and of course, honored to be a Solo ;) Claire's big brother, Nathan, is handling the situation with all the style and finesse expected from a Solo ;) and the family dog, Schnitzel, is still trying to convince me that Claire should bring up the rear of the pecking order in our pack instead of her :) \n\nThanks for the support of the entire virtual community - y'all are the best! \n\nRonSolo \n(Master of Sleep Deprivation Secrets)\n\n\n\n\n<shameless plugs>\n@tension, Inc. - Web design geniuses :-)\nWebdog - it simply rocks\nDallas Wind Symphony - Yours truly is Principal Hornist\nTravelocity - Online Travel Reservations and Information\nGameStats - Serious Gamers know this site, run by my good friends IRex and Tarok - cool beans\nGibbed.com - Best Clan listing on the net, and offers free hosting for clans as well\n</shameless plugs>\n\n\nThe old lame email for ya, may it R.I.P.\n\nSeptember 1997\nAugust 1997\nJuly 1997\nJune 1997\nMay 1997\nApril 1997\nMarch 1997\n\n"}, {"by": "rose@lith.com", "time": 912528120, "contents": "\n*** Monolith Production's Finger Server\n\nUser name: rose\nPlan modified: Mon Nov 30 13:54:50 1998\n\n11/30/98\n\nOk my time has come.

I am in love with paintball.  The thrill was unatouchable, never before have I hurt so bad after 2 hours of fun.  Running while in the squatted position is Cruely Difficult.

Yeehawwwww!  The Wheel of Time stuff is so pimp.  I'm so stoked about how the spell fx stuff are going!  The viz fx are going to rock!  We have some great stuff built and being integrated into the game already, and I know I have to be vague about specific fx, but the particle system stuff is going to take your breath away.  One word:  Balefire, baby!  Even our default weapon, which I like to call the Aes Sedai Death Blast, is going to blow you away [no pun intended] :)  The 3D objects stuff - trees, pick-ups, and other decorations are all keeping me busy too, and the realism that they'll add to this game is really going to bring Robert Jordons world to life.  I think this game is really gonna set the bar high for other [ahhhem, Quake 3, ahhhem] fps's.  Stay tuned for more exclusive details....\n\nAs for personal stuff, The BIG News is.... I have a SON now!!!  He was born in December, and he hasn't gone to sleep yet.  Just kidding of course, but life sure is tiring now!  He does sleep, but only a couple of hours at a time, so getting a real night's sleep ain't happening now.  Oh well, that should change soon.  I'm told that babies usually start sleeping through the night after a month or two.  Anyway, he's such a great kid and apart from it being a very long delivery, things went great.... until Christmas Eve.  My wife had to have her gall bladder removed (don't tell her, but I secretly took pictures to use for reference for the gib chunks).  This made for a truely memorable Christmas - in the hospital.  I split my time running back and forth between the hospital and home trying to take care of my wife, my baby (Sean) and Murphy - who's moved on to eating the couch that the remote control (that he ate) used to sit on.  To add to all this hectic personal stuff and the work on WOT, Legend and I are discussing the possibility of me moving on-site to Virginia!  I don't know what will happen, but I'd hate to move away from all my drinkin' buds up here in Massachusetts.  Speaking of which, did I ever get poopy-faced (can't say shit anymore with the young one around) on New Years Eve.  I think I drank about 23 or 18 Sammy's (that's Sam Adam's Beer for all you unfamiliar with New England's most special brew) and of course had to chase that with good olde Jamison's Irish Whiskey.  Add some champagne to the list, and .... well, lets just say that my sponser was pissed that I fell off the wagon again.\n\nWith all this stuff going on, of course I'm no longer playing soccer, but the season was great, and we made it to the finals!  Lost by one goal, but I did great and even scored one of our 22 goals.  I still want to stay active physically though, so I'm thinking of returning to my first true love.... candlepin bowling.\n\nStay tuned for the next exciting update, COMING SOON!\n\n\n09-04-98\n--------\nWell, I'm finally getting around to updating some of the stuff I've been working on, so here goes...\n\nI've taken a short break from working on creating some of the 3D angreal pick-ups and also the 3D visuals for the spell effects in order to work on 3D environmental items, such as trees, bushes, light sources, and other objects.  So far, I'm happy with the way the trees are looking, and I have a couple of light sources working nicely too.  As every 3D artist knows, it's always a struggle to keep a low polygon count and still have the objects look decent, and I think these pieces have a few more polys than other examples I've seen, but I definitely think that visually it's worth it.  I think they'll fit in quite well with the richness in texture and level design found in the rest of the game, which really looks awesome - I say this totally unbiased ;).\n\nFor the next couple of weeks I will be continuing on with environmental decorations (indoor and outdoor), as well as some environmental landscape textures. I will also be working on developing some cool (hopefully) special effects for spells and some other items... more on that in the future.  Also on deck is finishing the 3D angreal pick-ups.\n\nAs far as personal life goes, my wife is 6 months pregnant, my Golden Retriever, Murphy, (11 months old now) has picked up the habit of eating every magazine and/or remote control we happen to leave lying around, and we're working on fixing up several rooms in our house (yes,of course the future baby room too).  In addition, the indoor soccer league I play in starts up next Thursday (which I'm very much looking forward to, although my real wish is not to have a heart attack in the first game, seeing with all the other things I've been doing, I haven't really pushed the old cardio vascular system too hard for quite some time now).  I have to admit that I have been playing some Age of Empires here and there too, and judging from the screenshots and mini movies I've seen of AOE2, I'm saving a couple of bucks to get it when it comes out.  Pretty impressive looking, and like James,  I too like the depth of the game, strategy wise.\n\nThat's it for now.

In order for the credit to go to the right people, I \nwant to set the record straight. \n\nIn a nut shell, Remedy is *not* Future Crew.\n\nThere are only four members of the original FC working at \nRemedy, and considering that we currently have 18 people \nworking here in total, it's safe to say that Remedy and \nFuture Crew have very little to do with each other.\n\nSo, in other words, Max Payne is not being made by Future\nCrew, but a different team that comprises of highly talented\nindividuals who come from various kinds of backgrounds and \nwho, together, are what define Remedy.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------ \n[ Thu Aug 13 01:25:00 1998 ]\n\nGreetings to all you fine people out there!\n\nAs some of you know, Remedy founded a subsidiary company\ncalled Futuremark nine months ago to fully focus on 3D\nbenchmarks. We did this because Final Reality was such an\nunbelievably huge hit (so far over 7 million copies of it\nhave been distributed via bundles, making Final Reality one\nof the biggest software bundle deals ever in the industry).\n\nFuturemark has been working on its first own 3D benchmark\ncalled \"3DMark\" for some time now. It's fully based on\nRemedy's in-house developed technology. Yes, that's right,\nthe same technology that made the press go nuts at E3. Think\nof 3DMark as a technology show-off demo about Max Payne's\ntechnology, because that's exactly what it is. Ok, it's not\nJUST a technology demo, but also the world's first ever true\nGamers' Benchmark. Why Gamers'? Well, because it's fully\nbased on a game!\n\nThink of 3DMark as a snapshot of some of the technology we\nhave developed to be used in Max Payne.\n\nSo, if you've been wondering about what do the particle\neffects etc. look like, and you weren't in the E3 back room\non the GoD booth, now you're about to see with your own\neyes. This should give you a good idea about the tech stuff\nthat will be in Max Payne when it comes out (well, by then\nwe've obviously developed our technology even further).\n\n3DMark is coming out within two months and when it does,\nmake sure you get a copy of it!\n\nFor all 3DMark and Futuremark news, keep checking\n\nHTTP://WWW.FUTUREMARKCORP.COM\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------ \n[ Sun May 17 02:10:00 1998 ]\n\nE3 is right behind the corner and practically all of the\nestablished game developers of the world are gearing up for\nit. So are we.\n\nThere will again be lots and lots of jaw-droppingly amazing\ntitles on show from already established developers and also\nnewer setups like ourselves.\n\nAgain, we'll be seeing lots of me-too clones, but also games\nwith a much more original approach that are able to create\nnew sub-genres into the already established genres.\n\n1st and 3rd person shooters are advancing at a really fast\npace, but the development can mostly be seen in better\nlooking visuals rather than in the development of the story\nline, characters or gameplay depth. This is totally under-\nstandable as the technology is advancing so fast. However,\nthis can also have the unfortunate side-effect on some\ndevelopers that they spend most of their time just focusing\non visual technology. This might stray them away from the\n*real* thing which is the game itself. Get where I'm going\nwith this... ? ;)\n\nAnyhow, to make the point clear, we've not made compromises\nin Max Payne in regard to visual technology versus \"the\ngame\". Our plan is to have both in the extreme (which should\nbe great news to any serious gamer out there). It might not\nbe an easy thing to pull off, but when you have 15 highly\ntalented and motivated people, who suffer from an extremely\nserious case of forbearance and stubborness (very common\nhere in Finland), and who are all working long days on a\ncommon goal, you're bound to succeed.\n\nAnyhow, we've been working on Max Payne for more than a year\nnow. And during all this time all the \"physical evidence\"\nthat we've given out are a dozen screen shots, which, just\nby themselves, have caused quite a stir already. But trust\nme when I say this; the screen shots don't do Max justice,\nand you're hereby invited to come and check out what I mean\n(if you're going to be at E3, that is).\n\nOh, and I can't yet reveal on which booth we'll be present,\nbut if you've been following up on the news during the last\ncouple of months, you should have a pretty good idea. ;)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------ \n\nSamuli Syvahuoko is the managing director of Remedy\nEntertainment, Ltd., a leading developer of 3D action\ngames for the PC platform.\n\nCheck out the following web sites for more information:\n\nhttp://www.remedy-ent.com     (foreign visitors)\nhttp://www.remedy.fi          (finnish visitors)\nhttp://www.maxpayne.com\nhttp://www.futuremarkcorp.com\nhttp://www.3dmark.com\n"}, {"by": "sbrown@legendent.com", "time": 957908940, "contents": "------------------------------------\n3.1.00 - 13:31\n------------------------------------\n\nIf I really had something important to talk about you would know by now.\n\n------------------------------------\n4.7.99 - 2:10pm\n------------------------------------\n\nTask:  Inserted new weapon specific sounds.\n\n------------------------------------\n4.7.99 - 2:00pm\n------------------------------------\n\nMental Note:  Be sure you are in the correct directory\nbefore you insist the program is broken.\n\n------------------------------------\n3.1.99 - 5:00pm\n------------------------------------\n\nI'm taking a stand against the saying \"Sleep is over-rated\",\nas it is currently the only time when I actually have a life.\n\n------------------------------------\n2.24.99 - 10:15am\n------------------------------------\n\nOne hyphenated word:  NURBS-dongle\n\n------------------------------------\n2.4.99 - 12:47pm\n------------------------------------\n\nIt's been a while, I know...but things continue to get more\ncomplicated and the work continues to pile up and the\nworld continues to spin, and the sand continues to fall\nthrough the hour glass and so are the days of our lives...\n\nUgh.\n\nI had a number of things on my mind to talk about this\ntime around, but because I wasn't really planning on doing\nmy .plan right now I hadn't studied ahead of time (damned\npop quizzes).\n\nOne topic I wanted to discuss is the changes to the WoT\nhome page and the new message board. First off, thanks for\nall the compliments on the new page design, honestly it isn't\nreally our doing as GT has been reworking the site to mesh\nwith their advertising schemes, but it is nice to see the site\noverhauled...even if it takes time to get it all looking and\nsounding right (it's tough to get them to understand the\ndifference between fact and industry buzz words). As for\nthe message board, I understand this is a point of both\npraise and frustration. The outages on the board have been\nbothering me a great deal, as they have an annoying tendency\nto turn people away from the site (and it also looks pretty\nunprofessional). I know I've said a few dozen times already,\nbut I still think the host provider is at fault. The message board\nreally is pretty stable and even the author can't figure out how\nthe errors could be occurring (the database is designed\nto prevent these types of errors). So to all of you suggesting\none message board or another, it really wouldn't help.\nWWWBoard had errors, WWWThreads gets errors, my guess\nis any other board would get errors as well. Besides that, the page\nhas gone off-line once or twice for a few mins, so I really think it's\na problem with the server.\n\nAnother nugget I thought you all might be interested in, I got a\nchance to walk through every one of the levels last night (ah, the\nlife of a tester) some of them for the first time. I have to admit,\nthere were a number of times when my jaw just hit the ground.\nThere is so much attention to detail and just flat out beauty in these\nlevels. It's also amazing how well Jordan's familiar environments\nhave been recreated...and that's all the detail I'm giving :]\n\nFinally, I've got a treat for everyone. I figured I would post the\naccumulated nonsense from the white board in my office. Let\nme first make it clear that very little of what you see up there is mine.\n\n\n\nThis next picture is a simulation of what it might look like to walk\nthrough the Legend hallways after several days of no sleep and a\nbad caffeine hangover.\n\n\n\nWhat you see below is our angreal mastermind (uber brainiac?),\nAaron, working his magic in the early morning hours. A little known\nfact about Aaron, his super powers actually originate from the\npopular soft drink known affectionately as the \"Nectar of Speed\" and\ncommonly referred to as Mountain Dew (TM).\n\n\n\nFinally, I'm posting a picture of YT (yours truly for all you\nnon-Stephenson fans). This is me huddled behind my wall of \ncomputers on the brink of churning out more mind numbing drivel \nsuch as the text you are reading right now.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n1.14.99 - 11:38am\n------------------------------------\n\n*noting Aaron's .plan*\n\nI see how it is! Just trying to get your .plan noticed\neh! Well, I'll show you!\n\nOh, and I do have some extensive updates planned for this\nhere...er, .plan. I just have to find the time, perhaps\nwhen I get home tonight.\n\n------------------------------------\n12.23.98 - 4:00pm\n------------------------------------\n\nmmmm....crunchy milk...\n\nA phrase I was considering last night while slurping down\na glass of partially frozen milk (the refrigerator was set\ntoo cold, it would seem) and chatting with my roommate\nabout the various goings ons in our respective offices.\nDave was telling me about his office party and all the\nrediculous hours he and his co-workers work. I was talking\nabout the things we've been doing on WoT, about our\nupcoming move to new offices (woohoo!) and, naturally,\nall the wacky hours the guys here at Legend put in.\n\nAnd so I got to thinking about what it really means to work at\nLegend. There are numerous wonderful things about working\nhere. First (and foremost on all of your minds) is the chance\nto work on the amazing game, Wheel of Time and the opportunity\nto work on future games, like Unreal 2. It's also great being\na part of such a dynamic industry, one that is constantly\nchanging, evolving and revolutionizing the way we recreate.\nFinally, there's the people. . . Of course, there are some\ngreat people in the gaming industry, but I'm speaking more\nspecifically of those I know personally, those people who\nreside squarely in the middle of LegendLand. More than the\ngames create, we are defined by those who make up this unique little\nland, and a wonderful land it is. So, as my little Hallmark to\nall the citizens of LegendLand...\n\nHappy Holidays to:\n\nBob\nMike V.\nRosie\nGlen\nMike F.\nDave\nJim\nAaron\nJess\nMark\nDuane\nScott\nJames\nWarren\nMarc\nMatthias\nAndy\nEric\nSteve B\nSteve S\nJustin\nPaul\nJulie\nRobert\nAnd any other artists I haven't met :]\n\nAnd to each of your families...\n\nAlso, happy holidays to all of you who are faithful followers\nof WoT and to you less faithful, well, get more faithful...just\nlook at all the perks! (Meaning, you get to be included with the\nafformentioned \"faithful follower\" title.)\n\nThat's about it for my greetings card. I hope everyone has a safe\nand happy holiday and a wonderful New Year.\n\n------------------------------------\n12.14.98 - 8:00pm\n------------------------------------\n\nI realize it's been a month since my last update, but\nthere really isn't much for me to report on that anyone\nwould find interesting. I could tell you that I got in\na batch of really nice footstep sounds, but that isn't\nnearly as exciting as news from the level designers about\ncool levels or Aaron's awesome new angreal code. hmmm...\nI can't resist...I've got some great footstep and ambient sounds.\n\nAlright, so now that I've gotten past all the exciting stuff,\nI'll talk about my boring life a bit. Saturday night Jess Crable,\nmy roommate Dave and I went out to a lounge to watch Eric\nHeberling (who produces sound effects for WoT) perform in his\nband \"Flyer\". It was actually quite cool. They are basically\na coverband, but I was imperessed by their versitility playing\neverything from Rod Stewert to Tone Loc, including pieces from\nDishwalla, Alanis Morissette and Sheryl Crow mixed in. Now, that\nwas all great, but upstaging the wonderful show was this man on\nthe dance floor, who was, only in the loosest sense of the\ndefinition, dancing. This guy was wearing a Harley Davidson\nT-shirt that was long past its youth (not that I have anything\nagainst Harley Davidson, mind you, I am merely reporting what I\nsaw). Every milimeter of his face was sprouting hair, I honestly\nhad trouble differntiating the front of his head from the\nback....and his movements on the floor were like, well, they\nwere like a full body dry heave set to music. Watching this\nguy was like watching one of those FOX freak-fests such as\n\"When Lawn-Care Machinery Attacks!\" It was nearly impossible\nto draw my attention away from this man's seizure-like prancing\nabout the dance floor. Every few seconds Jess and I would turn\nto each other with puzzled looks on our faces and ask what the\nhell this guy was doing. Actually, I suppose there wasn't much\nquestion, he was having a good time, nothing wrong with that,\nhe just had a unique way of displaying his enjoyment...or, something.\n\nSo that's my bit of bizarre news...now for the more close to home\nstuff. A little while ago, ten of us here at Legend, went out to see\nStar Trek: Insurrection. Nice flick, it was fun, but certainly not great.\nRegardless of the movie, I had a great time with the group, and it's\nalso great to see them out of their natural habitat (the office). And\nwhile we're on the topics of dancing and unnatural habitats, Scott\nworked up an interesting little \"technology demo\" that demonstrates\nUnreal's various light effects and some cool character animations...it\nreally has to be seen and heard to be believed so I won't go into detail\nexplaining it here.\n\nWell, that's it for this report. I've got some other stuff stewing\nin my brain right now concerning some other personal life related\nmatters, but for now, I'll just hold off.

Like Jim\nsays in his .plan, William was a math guru, and I always got a kick challenging him with puzzles, most of which he\nsolved easily.  William was also very concerned about staying healthy, and worked out constantly and took\nnutritional supplements.  But I never knew he had an asthma problem.  He also wore black shirts -- everyday,\nwithout fail!\n\nWilliam had a great sense of humor, and an animated style when describing anything that interested him.  At the\nsame time he could be very serious and intense.\n\nAfter Rise of the Triad, William became the lead engine coder on Prey, and was responsible for all the amazing\nportal effects that game demonstrated back in 1997 - 1998, winning many E3 honors.  Unfortunately, the game\nwas too ambitious and had to be abandoned.  But, his work on the Prey editor (\"Preditor\") was also brilliant, and\nin fact the Max Payne editor is based on the Prey editor to a degree -- they almost look identical.\n\nI will sincerely miss William.  He was one of the good guys.\n\n========================================\nXmas Eve, 2001\n\nFor me this is always a weird, almost sad time of the year, walking the mostly empty office halls where people\nare usually abuzz with work activity, and the sounds of games being played--sounds that are somehow deafening\nin absence.  It's at a time like this that I realize how noisy my computer fan is!\n\nAnyway, congrats to Remedy for winning several Best Game of Year honors already, including Gamespot's \"Best\nSingle-Player Action Game\" award.  ( http://gamespot.com/gamespot/features/pc/bestof_2001/p3_02.html )\n\nAnd while I'm here, during the year a lot of people off the \"email street\" ask me how to get started in the game\nindustry, several a week it seems.  I always direct them to Kenn Hoekstra's (he's with Raven) excellent web page, \nwhich is a great resource of information, websites and links.  And last week on my 3DR company bio page I \nadded a list of books that will also help people with a desire to be in this industry--scroll past my bio info until you \nsee the headline, \"Scott's Library.\"  Here you'll see the game design books I recommend, including the best \nbooks I've read on running a small business, and other related stuff.  Anyone starting a game studio, regardless of \nhow big or small, really should read some of these books--I've found them all to be highly valuable and insightful.\n\nFinally, a Big-time Merry Christmas to all my family, Chana, Shane, Jace, Patches and Beau!\n\n========================================\nSept. 13, 2001\n\nThis has been a slow week, many of the companies 3DR deals with has been out of their \noffices (our publisher, for example, is not too far away from where the attack took place, \nand therefore they've been closed down), so I've been cleaning up the office and going \nthrough old files.\n\nI opened up a big storage box of shareware catalogs I've had since 1987.  Back in that \ntime, well before the web, well before demos, there were at least 500-1000 legitimate \ncompanies making money by advertising and selling shareware by mass mailing catalogs to \ncomputer owners worldwide.  Some of the bigger catalogs that you may remember include \nPublic software Library (PsL), Public Brand Software, Gemini, Best Bits & Bytes (always \nhad the dog on the cover), Big Byte Software, Shareware Express, and PC-SIG.\n\nThese catalogs typically contained descriptions for 100's of shareware programs, ranging \nfrom word processors, to games, communications software, education, programming languages \nand utilities, accounting, spreadsheets, and dozens of utilities, like List, FluShot, \nBaker's Dozen, Automenu, 4DOS, NewKey, PKZIP, Buerg utilities, on and on.  Practically \nnone of these exist today.  Even the company that invented the ZIP format has seemingly \nbeen replaced by the newer WinZip.\n\nIn one of the catalogs (PsL), the owner is talking about the need to upgrade to a top-of-\nthe-line computer.  The following is from the July 1990 issue, before anyone had ever \nheard of the \"Pentium\" or Windows:\n\n\"A bare-bones 486-25 was only $3800.  For about $1500 more, we got a package that included \na 15ms 104meg hard disk, 8 meg of memory, a 1.2meg floppy, a 360k floppy and two 1.44meg \nfloppies.  The computer has a Landmark speed rating of 114 mhz for what it's worth, verses \n55 mhz for a 386-33.\"\n\nHow far we've come.\n\n========================================\nMay 1, 1998\n\nResume Writing Tips for the Game Industry and Beyond:\n\nI see maybe 150 resumes each year.  Most contain too much information and the\nwrong emphasis on what's important.  In the past few months many people have\nasked me to review their resume and offer tips, so I've written this \"standard\nreply\" to use in the future, which I'll share here.\n\n[1]  Don't exceed a page in length.  Not even Albert Einstein, Benjamin\nFranklin or Thomas Edison have the credentials to exceed one page.  In fact,\nthe longer your resume, the more it looks like you're trying to hide the fact\nthat you don't have much going for you.  Short, concise resumes are those that\nactually get read.\n\n[2]  Include all forms of contact information, including address, phone, fax\nand email.  Make yourself easy to reach.\n\n[3]  The first section is titled \"Objective.\"  Make this one or two sentences,\nabsolutely no more.  Do not write a me-oriented objective (\"I'm looking for\nposition that exploits my design strengths, furthers my growth, and has real\nopportunities for advancement.\")  Instead, write a company oriented objective\nthat shows you're team and goal oriented (\"I'm a team player looking to help\ndevelop innovative games that achieve the company's vision and design goals.\")\nShort and sweet works best here.\n\n[4]  Next, in bullet point form, list three to five highlights, each one\nphysical line long.  This is the area in which you really sell yourself! \nReaders typically look here first because it summarizes your achievements and\nvalue.  Einstein, for example, might mention these things:\n\n*  Wrote Special Theory of Relativity, disproving several of Newton's laws\n*  Showed how mass and energy were equivalent (E=MC^2)\n*  Received the Nobel Prize in 1921\n*  Predicted existence of black holes 50 years before being detected\n*  Involved with the creation of atomic bomb\n\n[5]  After this, briefly mention your work history, but only as it pertains to\nthe job you're going after.  Don't mention unrelated positions that don't help\nyour cause.  Instead, say that you can provide an extensive work history upon\nrequest.  Don't bother putting down that you flipped hamburgers or bagged\ngrociers (unless you're appying for a job in those industries).\n\n[6]  In the education section, don't mention high school, only college and\nother related training.  Once again, you can mention that a more complete\neducation history is available on request.\n\nFor programmers, do not list every language and operating system under the\nsun, which makes you look like a jack of all trades but a master of none. \nYou're much better off listing one or two languages as your \"expertise,\" and\nif you know more say you're also \"familiar with the following languages.\" \nAnother key point is that most companies and developers prefer to hire\nspecialists, not generalists, so try to position yourself as a graphics\nspecialist, 3D engine specialist, AI specialist, network/Internet specialist,\netc.\n\nFor artists, coders, musicians, etc., you might want to say that samples and\ndemos are available on request.\n\n[7]  Regarding references, go ahead a list two or three, and if you have more\nsay they're available on request.\n\n[8]  The last piece of the puzzle is often overlooked:  the cover letter. \nThis is where you specifically mention why you want to work for the company,\nand why you like the company.  This is a great place to brown nose a little by\nspecifically mentioning company products and what you like about the company's\nvision, etc.  Prospective employers love to think you are applying to their\ncompany because you have a passion for the company.  Keep this letter to one\npage, don't be too wordy, and maintain professionalism.\n\nBest of luck.\n\n========================================\nMarch 27, 1998\n\nI've gotten a very good response to my recent plans about gameplay and the old\ndays of the arcade industry, and I've been asked to continue with similar\nupdates.\n\nFirst, so you know where I'm coming from, I started playing arcade games in\n1976, at the age of 15, but it wasn't until Space Invaders came out that I\nbecome a hopeless addict, spending my last quarter playing arcade games.  This\nled to several jobs working at arcades in the early 80's, when the industry\nwas booming and there were arcades on every corner like there are McDonald's\ntoday (this was the pre-Chicken McNugget's era).\n\nI met my future Apogee partner, George Broussard, in high school in 1978,\nwhere we both hung out in the computer room with a teletype time-share system,\nand an Apple II.  We became friends and ended up working at the same arcades\nin the early 80's.\n\nGeorge and I became top experts at many arcade games, and even entered several\ntournaments.  In one of the biggest Dallas-area tournaments, George took first\nplace and I got second, out of over 100 competitors.\n\nIn those days a top players would often carry around a sheet of paper with\ntheir best scores written down for all the games they were good at.  I've\nstill got my old papers somewhere.  We'd bump into other champion class\nplayers and compare scores.  George and I would usually have the better\nscores, so it occurred to us that we should start an official league of top\ngame players, and have an official high score database (too bad the Web wasn't\naround back then--it would have made it easy for us to do this).\n\nIn '82, we formed the NVGPA (National Video Game Players Assoc.), and we were\nwriting a newsletter, but then the opportunity came for us to write a strategy\nbook on how to beat the top arcade games of the day, so w"}, {"by": "scottmc@3drealms.com", "time": 922719600, "contents": "Account Name:  Scott McCabe\nEmail address: scottmc@3drealms.com\n----------\nWhy is it that soooooo many RPG's (with a few exceptions) are all Medieval? \n\nI would much rather play a game like Fallout\nthan some D&D game.

You would not believe what a difference HDTV makes to the experience - I initially hooked it up with the regular video in, just because I didn't want to mess with the HDTV cables, then I switched over to 1080 HDTV.  Not only is it visually far more sharp, colorful and impressive, but splitscreen multiplayer goes from being a confusing mucky mess to being very playable and fun.  I'm wondering if there is a way to split the screen vertically rather than horizontally, given that a widescreen HDTV makes it a bit more ideal to normal aspect ratio that way.  The surround sound works quite well also.  \n\nKudos to Bungie for a great experience.\n\n6-27-2001 4:56 PM\n---\n\n\nI'm headed off to Japan for a bit of a break tomorrow.  Maybe I'll head up to Hokkaido this time, I hear it's beautiful this time of year.

Sorry - but we can't talk yet. :)  I'm working away on levels and various stuff as usual.  \n\nFinally saw Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon yesterday.  I thought it was a great movie - if you are at all a fan of kung fu, dramas, or just beautiful cinematics, you should see this film.  I hope we see more movies of this style and caliber in the future.  \n\nHad good holidays.  It was nice to see my family and some of my friends after a year...  \n\nGoing back to old games, I finally dug up Samurai Spirits RPG after passing on it when it originally came out.  I'd never heard a lot of good stuff about it, unfortunately, but I figure I need to play it, given my fanatical devotion to the fighter series.  I'm only a few hours in, it's slow going given the bulk of Japanese.  It is good practice for my rusty brain however, as my knowledge has been steadily leaking away over the years.  It's overly linear so far, with large parts of the world map limited by torii gates until you finish the one place in that part of the world, sadly.  It does have some promise and novel ideas however, and the art, given the age of the neogeo is very impressive.  I'm enjoying it more than I expected to, but the jury is still out right now.\n\nMy NeoCD is the original model, the slow 1x speed.  Load times were simply unbearable for SSRPG, so I've been playing it on a PC NeoCD emulator where the load times are almost instant.  The only problem there is I'm missing out on the sound.  It seems unwilling to support my win2k soundblaster live setup.  If anyone out there has any ideas on how to get the NeoCD emulator working with that, I'd love to be able to play it with SNK's wonderful music and sound.  Drop me an email if you've got any answers at sdalton@legendent.com.\n\nSpeaking of NeoGeo's...  I recently purchased an arcade NeoGeo stand up arcade machine from ebay.  I even found a samsho 64 cart and hyper neogeo motherboard for it.  Yeah, it's sick, but damnit - Samurai Spirits deserves more credit than it ever got.  I've always wanted to have an arcade machine, and even though I really have no need for an aging neogeo considering I've already got a home system, I can't think of another setup I'd rather have.  Well, okay - perhaps the Japanese dual monitor sit down version, but hey, I'll live.\n\nAnyway, back to work...  Another useless .plan update to contribute to the compost heap.\n\n10-20-2000 2:31 PM\n---\n\nSeanbaby - I love you.\n\nhttp://www.seanbaby.com/news/nike.htm\n\n\n9-24-2000 3:03 AM\n---\n\nWell, I've seen it reported incorrectly on three sites now, so I figured I should post a note.  \n\nChris Hargrove is not working in North Carolina at Epic.  He's actually here at Legend Entertainment in Virginia.\n\nYes, he's working away with us on Unreal 2.  He's originally from this area, and we've been working with him on and off since he came back in August, although he officially began at the beginning of this month.  \n\nHe's fitting right into the team here, and has been able to jump right into working on the project full speed.  And we've got a fresh fighter in our Soul Calibur ritual. :)\n\nI guess this has turned into a \"Welcome to the Team, Chris!\" .plan update, but anyway, those are the facts. \n\nI finished ChronoCross this afternoon...  \n\nBack to work I suppose.   Speaking of work - I'm working to finish up some levels for testing and use with some various gameplay programming stuff.  I'll be working with Mark get it all going, now that he's finished up all his Unreal Gold work and fully back onto Unreal 2 stuff.  I'd go into more detail if I could, but that'd be a no-no.  A new Legend website should be going up pretty soon though - perhaps there will be something to wet some appetites.  Geoff, our one off-site LD is coming in next week so that we have a chance to meet him in person.  \n\nAs long as I've got a convenient segue to travel, I'd might as well mention I'm heading to Japan for a little bit of down time in a few weeks.  Its been several years since I came back, so I'm looking forward to visiting again.  I'll be heading to Osaka and Kobe this time around.  While I've visited places all around Honshu, I haven't been to either of these cities before - it should be an adventure.\n\n\n9-22-2000 1:01 PM\n---\n\nThe brutal truth comes out!\n\n\n\nwe see Warren, sitting at his desk, hard at work...   don't we?\n\n\nNow for the harsh reality.\n\n\nWarren has been thrown down the stairs once too many, and his killer has craftily replaced him.  My ninja-spy network has captured the truth on film, but how long will it take to bring his killer to justice?\n\n\n\n8-29-2000 11:42 AM\n---\n\nI'm really excited about DirectX 8's new features - in particular, DirectCrate - check out this info :\n\nAbout DirectCrate\nDirectCrate"}, {"by": "seanc@gearboxsoftware.com", "time": 1006113120, "contents": "Login: seanc          \t\t\tName: Sean Cavanaugh\nDirectory: /home/seanc              \tShell: /bin/bash\nLast login Mon Nov 12 13:30 (CST) on pts/4 from gbx-10-21.gearboxoffice.net\nNo mail.\nPlan:\nNov 17 2001\n\nFactoids:\n\n\tI have now seen two reviews of Half-life for PlayStation 2 call the original Half-life for\nPC 4 years old.

Although there's still a lot of other work to be done on the add-on, I'm pretty much completely moved on to Sanity, and I've started work on my first level.  So far I'm really loving the change. :)\n\nTook a look at the Blood 2 multiplayer patch and it's looking really good.  We're talking about some final game balancing issues, but at this point every build we do we hope is the last build, so it should go out soon.  We sure do appreciate everyone's patience with this patch.  We realize it's taken us longer than expected, but the extra time has guaranteed that we could do things right.\n\nI've been working on some personal projects in my spare time which I'll probably make available soon.  Nothing big, just working on putting my web site up again and some other stuff.  Watch this space for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/2/98\n\n------------\n\nAs everyone probably knows, the Blood 2 demo is now available. :)  We're getting pretty positive response overall, but I wanted to do a short update on our status.  First, here's an e-mail alias where you can send bug reports and suggestions about the demo:\n\nb2demobugs@lith.com\n\nPlease send all bug reports to that address, and make sure to include info on what type of system you are playing on.  Also, make sure you are using current versions of DX6 and your video drivers.  We'll just be collecting e-mails from this source, so don't expect a response unless we need more info to diagnose the problem.  But rest assured, we'll look at each and every message.\n\nPlease don't e-mail me with tech support questions.  I don't have the knowledge or time to be a great help to anyone.  I just make levels and stuff. :)\n\nWe have addressed several issues since the demo was released, and I'll briefly touch on the major ones:\n\nSpeed: Many people have complained that Blood 2's performance isn't on a level with Shogo's.  I'm happy to say that Mike Dussault has trained his keen engineering eye on B2 and blessed it with speed.  He has greatly improved the performance over the last few days and B2 is now very playable on a much broader range of machines.\n\nMouselook (lack thereof): Hit 'u'. :)  If that doesn't work, go to the options menu, select controls, and scroll down until you see the option \"mouseaimtoggle\", and look at what key it is assigned to, or assign it to a key.  If that doesn't work for you please throw us an e-mail on the alias listed above.  Make sure and send us info on your system and what mouse you are using.  We have added mouselook to the \"mouse\" menu in the options screen so that this will not remain a source of confusion in the final version.\n\nMouse Sensitivity: Some people have complained about sporatic mouse sensitivity.  The sad truth is that the B2 team got so used to the mouse at that high a level that we didn't even think about fixing it. :)  This has been fixed, and the mouse turning is closer to Shogo's (but you can still crank it, you masochist!).\n\nCrash bugs: As of our latest build all known crash bugs have been squashed.  The game is a LOT more stable now than the demo.\n\nLimb Loss (lack thereof): This feature is actually in there (use the assault rifle and concentrate on a leg, especially while ducking), it's just not frequent enough.  We'll be tweaking and improving this whole system so it is more robust and obvious, and looks a lot better when it happens.  These tweaks will most likely go into the point release, not the version we initially ship.\n\nBlood (not enough): Rest assured that we'll be continuing to work on the gore effects, and will be taking suggestions even after the full version ships.\n\nThe levels are too techie, not gothic like Blood: Actually, Blood 2 only has a handful of techie levels, and we just happened to choose one of them for the demo.  Many of the levels are darker and scarier, but we didn't want the whole game to look dark and dreary, so we tried to mix it up with some bright installations.  There are a broad array of environments in the final game, and the demo levels are only one of them.\n\nThat's most of the commonly occuring stuff.  I know that doesn't cover every bug people are having, but I just wanted to cover some of the most commonly voiced questions and complaints.\n\n***New, Improved, Blood 2 Demo***\n\nYes, we will be releasing a new and improved Blood 2 demo, mainly so people can see the speed improvements.  The details are undecided at this point, but we will probably release it shortly after the game goes gold.\n\n***Multiplayer Demo***\n\nFor those who only play multiplayer, yes, we will be releasing a multiplayer demo.  We won't release it until we get the updated net code that Shogo is testing out and integrate it into B2's code, which will be the Blood 2 point release, which should arrive in late November, early December at the latest.\n\n***Blood 2 Final***\n\nNo, we haven't gone gold yet, but we are very close.  We've frozen all content and are trying to work out the last of the bugs.  That's all I'll say for now. :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/28/98\n\n------------\n\nJust a quick update.  The demo is pretty much done on the content side, and is very cool.  We're just working out a few of the bugs.  Should be released very soon, definitely by the weekend.  We've got an army of GT muscle ready to promote it for us, so once it goes up it should be available from a large number of sources.  That's it. :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/27/98\n\n------------\n\nAck!  Too many e-mails!  Must finish Blood 2!\n\nThanks for all the votes of confidence, I really appreciate it!  But I must now request a moment of silence to get this bad boy out the door. :)\n\n"}, {"by": "shane@scott.net", "time": 932075280, "contents": "\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              **> Welcome to Scott Network Services, Inc. <**\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUsername: shane                     In real life:                       \n\n\n\nProject:\nThis user has no project.\n\nPlan:\nJuly 15 1999 559: AM\n\nOk,I haven't updated in a while, so I decide to post a link to a new painting I did.\n\nI think there are toooooo many words in plan files and not enough goodies!\nSo I'll keep it short and sweet.\n\nHere is the link....\nhttp://www.scott.net/~shane/Paintings/Goddess.html\n\nCheck it out!\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nShane Caudle\nLevel Designer, 3D Modeler & Artist.\nfor UNREAL & UNREAL TOURNAMENT\nShane@Scott.Net \nwww.scott.net/~shane\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n**************************************************************\nApril 4 1999 336: PM\n\nHappy Easter everyone!

We all worked like dogs, but\nwe made our deadline!  Deus Ex is no longer a glorified\ntechnology demo; now it's beginning to look like a game...\n\nThe AI is starting to look good.  I've spent most of the\nlast few weeks working on combat AI.  I've still got a lot\nof work left to do, mostly in the arcane realm of\noptimization.  I also need to differentiate the NPCs a bit\nmore; right now, they all fight the same way (albeit with\ndifferent weapons).  With luck, all of this will be done\nbefore E3.\n\nSpeaking of E3...

Writing the UI library was\nfun, but I'm *really* looking forward to getting my grubby\nlittle paws into the AI again.\n\nSidebar:\n\nI overcame my addiction to Half-Life just in time to become\naddicted to Baldur's Gate.  If you're into RPGs at *all*,\nI can't recommend this one enough.  It's got its fair share\nof problems, but it's a remarkably stable product and it's\na lot of fun to play.

(Betcha won't hear THAT in\nfuture Deus Ex reviews!  :)  Now I'm in the process of adding\nsome new features to the list widgets, fixing a couple of\nsmall bugs, and working on combo boxes.\n\nI've spent the last four nights staying up 'til 4am playing\nHalf-Life.  This is the most addictive game I've played since\n1988, when I was hooked on the original Phantasy Star for the\nSega Master System.  Half-Life is soooooo cool!  I'm in awe\nof the sheer amount of DETAIL they put into that game!\n\nValve, I salute you!  Great job!\n\nThe final episode of Babylon 5 is on tonight.  Should be\na bittersweet departure for my favorite show.  Time to pull\nout the Kleenex...\n\n\n=== Fri. 10-30-98 ===\n\nWork continues apace.

Goodbye to fantasy and gothic, hello real world. When you see the levels in this game you are gonna totally like them. There is a lot of attention to detail (note that my spelling does not reflect the design of maps or other level_design ers abilities. hehe)\n\nAlso wanted to say I have been working like mad. The change from Quake2 to LithTech was quite odd but I think I have got the general bit of it down as far as making geometry and how the lighting works. \n\nI still dont know all the good stuff but I learn more and more every day and I hope to share the knowledge I recieve with you guys once I get a chance.\n\nAny ways, I think that is all I got to say for today.\n\nHope to be back soon,\n\nUntil next time, CYA!\n\n-Wolfen\n\n\n\n12/31/98\n\nHAPPY NEW YEARS TO YOU ALL. I hope you all have/had (depends on when you read this hehe) a good new years.\n\nIm working on a little side project for all them level editors of the lith tech engine. I think it will be a good thing for you guys once it gets going.\n\nThe current project Im on here is rolling along good. Player model is coming to play woohoo hehe. Levels are looking killer. I mean come one, we got people from Shogo on the team so of course levels will kick bootie. They have a lot more time then they did with Shogo so it should be cool.\n\nTake it easy all, and untill next year. CYA!\n\n-Wolfen12/29/98\n\nHey guys!\n\nTwo things,\n\nFirst. I wanted to say good job to the guys at Planet Shogo for there nice downloadable Shogo editing docs. Kick ass guys. (thats www.planetshogo.com to those who dont know)\n\nSecond. I am not sure if anyone knows how to do this but I have not seen it yet anywhere, and that is how to make a see though or transparent brush or catwalk if you will.\n\nFirst you need to make the brush that you want to be the transparent brush/catwalk/grill (get the idea? hehe)\n\nThen you need to keep that brush selected. Then right click in one of the views and select \"bind to object\".\n\nFrom there just select door. Nothing else just door. Then click ok or close or whatever that button is.\n\nNext, you want to texture the brush with a special texture thats all black and meant to be transparant. I cant remember which one for shogo was all black or meant to be all trans but i think its in the root texture list.\n\nThen you need to find the grate textures that you can use. Dont remember that one either, i know its there though (sorry working with a new tex set heh) and you place this grate texture as the face of the brush he will be walking on, usually the top one =P\n\nI think the important thing to know for now is, that you need to bind a brush to the door entity (object) and give its property the transulecent tag and solid tag to make this. The textures are there some where, but I have not noticed anyone mention how to do it yet so I thought I would say something.\n\nLet me know if you all know of a site that has this. Then maybe I wont speak out next time and look like a moron =P\n\nUntill next time. CYA!\n\n-Wolfen\n\n\n12/26/98\n\nWell hello there people. Not much news since it was the holidays and the office was pretty much empty. Considering most of the projects are in early stages I guess people figured they would take there time off for now. The Shogo team especially since they are the ones who worked there rear ends off.\n\nI hope everyone had some good holidays. I stayed with some freinds and there place and had a big dinner and all since I have no family out here =(\n\nI had to give up my qeradiant site this week becuase I have no more time for it =(\n\nThat was my baby. If your a QERadiant fan then defintly keep up with Ravages of Radiant (www.planetquake.com/ravage) becuase the guy None1a that took over was probably the best candidate for it.\n\nI plan on opening another website sometime soon. Maybe I will start one on DEdit and see if I can get permission to make it like some kind of Official Editing site for it hehe. Then I could be the perfect news hound for you all but this time with a different cool editor.\n\nIts just hard to keep up with an editor that isnt even related to a project you work on for a living. hehe.\n\nAnyways, take it easy all.

Been busy mapping and trying to get my old site up and running fully. \n\nSome new versions of the editor that are internal versions are looking like a lot of bugs and features are being worked out and its looking a lot better everyday. This I can deal with =)\n\nI have no idea when the press release for the project I am on is going to be. We still have some things to take care of it sounds like. I am not to used to ins and outs of how a game company does things (im sure some are different to) but there is one thing that has to be done for sure before the press release I do know this.\n\nAnyways I gotta finish my map, as I am like 2 days behind on it and its all becuase I had a bad week last week. So I will be mapping all the rest of today and next week ehehe. Like I am really supposed to be doing anything else eh? hehehe\n\nAnyways. Untill next time. CYA!\n\n-Wolfen12/17/98\n\nWell hello there.\n\nTip of the day. Dont move to Seattle WA unless you plan on paying way to much for your plates on your car. I paid $409 just for my 95 Saturn Twin Cam. Then they had the nerve to charge me state tax's as well. Man am I broke now.\n\nAnyways, I just filled out some answers to some questions for some book coming out about making games. I dont know if they will put my stuff in or not but that would be cool. \n\nI hear a CTF came out for Shogo. Rock on. I gotta go play that. Looks like me and mike and darren dont gotta make one now =P\n\nAnything else we should all make? I was thinking maybe a Rocket Arena for Shogo. That would definatly be interesting. Of course it would now have to be called TOW Arena hahah.\n\nAnyways, I got some maps to make. So until next time.

I can not stand doing html. I really need some one to take over my old site at planetquake.com/ravage.\n\nI got this whole new design and of course, I am having trouble with it cuase its just not my bag baby. Im just a mapper what do you expect?\n\nOh, if you aint played Get Medieval, you gotta at least get it for its cutscenes, especially the intro haha, that thing is hillarious. \n\nOther then that not much more for me to talk about tonight, maybe Ill have something more interesting on a regular work day like tomorrow.\n\nUntill next time.

DEdit is cool and has some cool stuff to play with in it. So now I support the two unless Robert Duffy makes me a SHOGHO Plugin for QERadiant hehe (hint hint).\n\nWhats with there being very few Shogo servers? Come on now. The game is good enough to play over the net. I finally got down to it the other night and was having a blast. \n\nYou all out there need to set more of them up.\n\nDoes anyone think I should throw a webcam into my office? My thoughts are, its to overused allready, and I dont think Im cool enough to where anyone would really care heh. Email me your thoughts on all this people.

I have a theoretical fix\nin the works, but it'll take a few hours\nto finish coding and test it.  After that,\nQA will have a go and we'll see if it passes\nmuster.\n\nIf everything goes well the fix should be\nin the v1.01 patch, which will be available\nfriday-ish at:\n\nhttp://www.anachronox.com/patches.html\n\nWe (the coders) are aiming to make Anox\nwin2k-friendly (though still unofficially\nsupported, alas) as quickly as possible.\n\nNote that the patch will weigh in at around\n5 MB, so downloading it shouldn't cause\nanyone undue stress.  The patch also fixes\nseveral minor issues and improves load\ntimes considerably.\n\nNote also that several people have written\nme with various workarounds which have\nfixed the win2k crash for them.

I'd also like to thank all the programmers and designers on the project who have been the best teammates I've ever worked\n with on a game.\n\nHere is an exerpt from a memo regarding SOF animation I sent out awhile ago.  Some people might find it interesting. . .\n\nThe motion capture session in LA happened around Sept. 15.  I directed the shoot with Eric Turman's help.  It took a month and a half for\n Eric and House of Moves to perfect a system that allowed us full control of the motion capture.  This was imperative because, in games, \nthe animation has to work together in real time--there is no cutting to hide the fact that anims don\u00c2\u0092t \u00c2\u0093match up\u00c2\u0094 like there is in movies and \nanimated cinematic sequences.  We have to be able to manipulate the motion capture. . .\n\n1)\tto eliminate \u00c2\u0093popping\u00c2\u0094 due to changes in body position\n2)\tto exaggerate the movement so that it looks dynamic on a simple model and from distances\n3)\tto \u00c2\u0093fix\u00c2\u0094 the problems that occur when you go from 60 Hz to a 10 Hz (our game speed)\n\nEric Turman's accomplishment of allowing \"fully tweakable motion capture\" was unprecedented according to House of Moves who \nworks with premier effects houses like Digital Domain, ILM, etc.   It took awhile to get working, but it was worth it!   I always say, even if we do \n80% of what we planned on this game, it will still be light years ahead of what we have seen in first person shooters to date.\n\nJust wanted to congratulate Gil Gribb, Eric Turman and others on perfecting an animation work flow that is so streamlined that we have\nnearly all of the enemy animations complete for the entire game!  (and we are months away from release!)  We have applied roughly \n420 animations to our models.  One of our animators (Jarrod Showers) applies as many as 6 per day!  Congratulations, guys.  Now\nwe have extra time to spend on the vast cinematics for the game as well as perfecting the non-human enemies.\n\nI haven't updated my finger in awhile.  We've been so busy on SoF.  Everything is coming along great.  The art for the game is nearly \ncomplete!\n\nUnfortunately, I must announce my departure from Raven come August 1st.  I've decided to pursue my film career in Austin, Texas.\nThis will in no way hurt Soldier of Fortune as our art alpha date is August 1st.  Almost all of our work, barring tweaks, will\nbe done by that date.  I want to say that the Soldier of Fortune team is the best group of people I've ever had the privilege of working \nwith.  I will miss Raven very much.  I also want to thank the guys at House of Moves, our motion capture house in L.A., who were a \njoy to work with as well.\n\nJoe Koberstein, a tremendous leader in the art department, will take over my responsibilities for the last weeks of the project.  Eric\nTurman will continue his outstanding work as Senior Animator.  As work dwindles, most everyone else will move on to Star Trek.  \n\nKeep your eye on Soldier of Fortune, everyone.

Here are some of the things that I've recently worked on:\n\n\nFixed the bug that caused scripted AIs to go into their idle state instead of their aggressive state (caused the bug that allowed you to walk right up to an enemy without getting a cap in your ass ;)\n\nFixed the bug that caused AIs not to target enemies that were firing at them.\n\nIncreased the visible range of the AIs (so they should always 'see' you when you can see them).\n\nFixed AIs being sometimes afraid to go down stairs bug.\n\nFixed muzzle flash not going away when you die (the \"firefly of death\" bug :)\n\nIncreased death brush damage (sometimes you could bounce out of a death brush before you were killed)\n\nMade dead bodies disappear after 2 minutes in multiplayer (will probably make this a console command, so dead bodies can stay around as long as people wish ;)\n\nFixed bug that allowed you to zoom (the sniper rifle) when in vehicle mode\n\nIncreased energy grenade damage (makes this weapon a lot more useful, especially in multiplayer ;)\n\nMade player footstep sounds play in client's head (makes them a little louder, and sound more consistent)\n\nAdded longer pause after you die before load screen comes up (fixes \"why am I in the menus?..oh, I must have died\" bug)\n\nFixed red screen of death bug (bug that caused the screen to stay tinted red after reloading a saved game)\n\n\nAnyway, these are some of the game related fixes that I've made in the last few days.  I have many more on my list for the patch, but I don't see any problem getting them all done on time :)\n\nI should also note that MikeD has *totally* pimped out the multiplayer code.  Can you say \"silky smooth\", I thought you could ;)\n\n\n-$-\n\n\n8/28/98\n\nWord-up Sandi!  How's everything over there in accounting land?

We all know that there isn\u00c2\u0092t really room in the first-person shooter market for a game that isn\u00c2\u0092t about, well\u00c2\u0085what exactly are most first-person shooters about?\u00c2\u0085oh yeah, SHOOTING stuff!  So where was I\u00c2\u0085Anime and and first-person shooters\u00c2\u0085Come on.  Have you actually seen any of this Anime stuff?!?  It has all these \u00c2\u0093weird\u00c2\u0094 things that just don\u00c2\u0092t fit in the first-person shooter genre.  Like these big robot things.  Come on, who really wants to run around in a giant robot stepping on people, and cars, and buildings, and\u00c2\u0085come on, where does that fit into the whole \u00c2\u0093dungeon crawl\u00c2\u0094 experience that a first-person shooter MUST have.  Sure, these robot things carry big guns that do more damage than ever before seen in a first-person shooter (hmmm, maybe that\u00c2\u0092s the problem\u00c2\u0085do people really want big guns, and big explosions, and body / robot parts flying all over the place\u00c2\u0085that just distracts from being able to enjoy the whole \u00c2\u0093dungeon crawl\u00c2\u0094 aspect that is required (isn\u00c2\u0092t it?) of a first-person shooter.  People don\u00c2\u0092t really want that (do they?)\u00c2\u0085\n\nAnd this whole thing about a story.  Come off it.  All I wanna do is SHOOT stuff\u00c2\u0085I don\u00c2\u0092t care if there are multiple endings, and that you don\u00c2\u0092t really know who\u00c2\u0092s on your side and who isn\u00c2\u0092t.  I just want to SHOOT somebody.  I don\u00c2\u0092t want my actions to affect anything that happens in the game.  I wanna know that every time I play level 35 that the creature on the left will yell \u00c2\u0093urgle blorg\u00c2\u0094 (Note: since a real first-person shooter takes place in some sort of dungeon it must contain some type of \u00c2\u0093creature\u00c2\u0094 that, of course, doesn\u00c2\u0092t speak English), and spit its acid snot at me, and that if I run down the tunnel to the right and jump into the lava that I\u00c2\u0092ll find the super-duper-special powerup that now makes me able to kill \u00c2\u0093urgle\u00c2\u0094 with 15 shots instead of 25.  Now, THAT is what makes a first-person shoot fun!  Come on.  Most Anime doesn\u00c2\u0092t have this kind of stuff.  It has characters, that get developed, and grow, who you come to like (or hate).  And plots that makes you feel sad (or happy) when they die \u00c2\u0085I don\u00c2\u0092t want to feel sad, or happy, or any of those \u00c2\u0093fuzzy\u00c2\u0094 ways\u00c2\u0085I just want to shoot things\u00c2\u0085\n\nGet real.  Look at the weapons in Anime\u00c2\u0085They\u00c2\u0092re just plain \u00c2\u0093weird.\u00c2\u0094  Who wants to shoot energy beams at people anyway?  And multiple rockets (coming out of the same gun at the same time?!?)\u00c2\u0085No sir-e-bob, one rocket was good enough for my father\u00c2\u0092s father, so dag-nab-it, one rocket should be good enough for me!\n\nNope.  Anime is too \u00c2\u0093weird\u00c2\u0094 to inspire a first-person shooter\u00c2\u0085\n\n\nHehehehehehehehehehe\u00c2\u0085.\n\nSarcasm?  No thank you, I brought my own.\n\n\n(oh...one last thing...there was thiS certain person, who asked me to mention them in my .plAn file...well, I wasN't quite sure if she was really up to the high quality stanDards that I try to set, when writIng these...So, I decided to shank...hehehehehehe ;)\n\n\n-$-\n\n\n\n5/20/98\n\nPFP can bite me.\n\n\nShogo:\n\nI spent last week getting demo functionality in for E3.  It is pretty cool, makes \"manning the booth\" a bit easier :)\n\nNow I'm working on fixing up the weapon effects a bit for E3, they've haven't been touched in a while (and it shows :).\n\nI just implemented a level-placed camera object, which should allow level designers to set up some pretty cool in-game stuff.  I think Shogo's levels really lend themselves to some cool cinematic sequences, so now we can exploit that a little more ;)\n\n\nMy pathetic life:\n\nSaw Dogzilla (whatever) today.  It could have been worse.  If you haven't seen it and want to know what it is like, basically just mix Independence Day, Jurrasic Park, and Biloxi Blues (Ferris Bueller was awesome, but Mathew Broderick ain't no hero)...\n\nAs long as I'm talking about over-hyped movies...Deep Impact...what a waste.  If you haven't seen it, don't.  Save your $.  I actually wanted the Asteroid to hit the Earth.  I was thinking \"Gee if the Asteroid hits the Earth then maybe all these lame characters will be killed and the movie will be over!\"\n\nAfter seeing the trailers preceeding Frogzilla, I'm afraid we're in for a long boring summer at the movies...oh well, there is always Shogo to look forward to ;^}\n\n\n-$-\n\n\n4/20/98\n\nI would have to agree with Pendle-bunz about the .plan thang :)\n\nSo what have I been up to....hmmm, where to start.  I've spent quite a bit of time recently on the AI:\n\nExpanded my AI scripting system to support looping\nscripts, opportunity firing (i.e., stop the script to put a cap in your ass, then continuing the script) and different levels of blocking priorities (i.e., can the player block a\nscripted AI or does the AI push the player out of the way).\n\nAlso implemented AI and player hand-held weapon models.  It is pretty cool to see the AI and player's hand-held weapon change when they switch weapons (and fall to the ground when they die so you can pick it up).\n\nAlso implemented an initial version of texture (surface) specific special fx.  This is a pretty cool feature.  This allows us to tie certain sounds or fx to a texture so brushes with a metal/wood/etc. texture make the appropriate sounds when players/AI walk on them.  Also weapon impacts make the appropriate sounds and effects on these surfaces as well...Pretty cool...\n\n\nOn the social side of things...JJ and I have been hitting the links quite a bit the last week.  Now JJ is a natural (we call him 'Tiger-Shark' since his game is a cross between Tiger Woods' and GregNorman's).  In other words, he is just plain intimidating.  When we're playing for money and I've got that 4 foot par putt and he's got a 50 yard chip over trees for par, and he holes it out...I'm just like \"Damn, I've just been John Jacked!\"...and of course I'm so pissed, that I miss my putt and end up throwing my putter into a water hazzard...\n\nIt seems like a lot of people at Monolith have been talking about playing more.  Maybe we should start a Monolith tourney.  Hmmm, that could be interesting.  I'll have to think on that one...\n\n\n$\n\n\n1/26/98\n\nNo comment.\n\n\n11/24/97\n\nFBI FILE #708231366\nName: Kevin Stephens\nWhereabouts: Unknown\nKnow Aliases: Money, BadAsh, MenuBoy\n\nMOST RECENT CRIME: EMAIL EXTORTION\n\n*** Following are excerpts from a string of internal \n*** Monolith emails which, we believe, contain enough \n*** conclusive evidence of email extortion to put\n*** #708231366, and the rest of his band, away for a \n*** very, very long time.\n\n\n*** START OF MONITORED EMAIL ***\n\nFrom:\tKevin Stephens \nSent:\tWednesday, November 19, 1997 5:53 PM\nTo:\tAll Monolith Personnel\nSubject:    SPY HUNTER E-MAIL-A-THON\n\nHi All...\n\nI just got off the phone with **EDITED** from **EDITED** (I think where we got Rastan from) anyway, he told me that we can have our very own Spy Hunter machine (just like the arcade!!!) for around $500 bucks!

I think I was writing out missions for Sanity. As I worked I heard a low dull hum, first I checked my speakers, they weren\u00c2\u0092t on, then I flicked the light switch a couple of times, the humming persisted. I decided to ignore it and go back to work. After that all I remember is a bright flash and hundreds of flashing colored lights, right before I fell unconscious I think I saw the face of our PR guy Paul Butterfield dimly, then all I saw was black. I think I also vaguely remember finding myself nude in a hotel bathtub, I noticed the soap had a picture of the golden gate bridge, (or maybe it was the bay bridge) stamped into it. Then I remember seeing Paul again, he was holding some kind of hypodermic needle, and then it was black again. I must have been asleep for a long time because I awoke at my desk 4 days later. I was wearing different clothes (clean ones though) and I found myself clean-shaven for once (and I don\u00c2\u0092t mean just my face), there was also a large bandage on my forehead and an empty package of airplane peanuts in my pocket. Since then I\u00c2\u0092ve had these weird dreams of hauling a heavy case up and down flights of stairs and repeatedly showing and explaining Sanity to eager onlookers. There were also glimpses of racing through rush hour traffic at break neck speeds. I figure it\u00c2\u0092s a result of work related stress, it will probably pass.  A few days after I noticed it was extremely painful for me to walk and sit down. It passed, and strangely enough Paul has been uncharacteristically sympathetic  of late, he\u00c2\u0092s even taken to giving me warm hugs when we see each other in the halls of Monolith.  This is such a great working environment.\n\n    On a completely different note, make sure to check out the preview of Sanity on IGN.  \n http://pc.ign.com/previews/11237.html\n\n     As for the development of Sanity, everything is going along swimmingly. We are right on schedule or ahead of schedule with most of the content and features. The development of the psionic abilities is in full swing. We\u00c2\u0092ve pretty much tied up the rest of the mission and story progression for the single-player. This story is so weird and cool, we want our single-player adventure to be new and refreshing for gamers used to all the standard game plot themes. I\u00c2\u0092ve started plotting out some of the more advanced AI capabilities for special summoned creatures and end-level bosses. We\u00c2\u0092ve also been working on getting the levels populated with all kinds of nifty interactive things to do, clue elements, and puzzles. The in-game interface has finally gotten refined to a state where it is concise, simple, easy to use and visually cool to look at. I\u00c2\u0092m going to get the engineers to add in the stuff for \u00c2\u0093going insane\u00c2\u0094 and for head explosion, hopefully in the next couple of weeks. We also have to start ramping up to an E3 demo that has as much cool stuff in it as possible. There\u00c2\u0092s lots of stuff to do before we\u00c2\u0092re done of course, but things are going well, the team\u00c2\u0092s psyched there\u00c2\u0092s no big road blocks, we are going for the gold\u00c2\u0085.whooeee, I\u00c2\u0092m so excited, I think I need to do some jumping jacks....oh..yeah !!!...owch,that hurts!\n\n\n \n\n \n"}, {"by": "story@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 890498460, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.4!\n\nName: Raven Story\nEmail: ebiessman@mail.ravensoft.com\nDescription: Raven Story\nProject: \nLast Updated: 03/21/1998 12:38:28 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRead it again, it's a kick in the pants!\n\nFade Away: A Serial Story\n**************************\n\nCHAPTER ONE: ECHOES OF THE MIND (By Eric Biessman, Designer)\n\nAs the cold rays of the morning sun broke through my drawn window \nshades, I stirred uncomfortably in my sitting position.  Muscles \nthat I didn't even know existed screamed with the use, angry with \nme for their continued idleness.  Even still, I sat there as I had \nsat for the last three days, quietly gripping the cold black metal \nof a loaded .44 Automag.  You see, it wasn't a question of were \nthey going to be coming for me, it was when would they be coming \nfor me.\n\nThe steady drip of the faucet and the stiffness of my body were \nenough to assure me that I was at least still alive.  During the \nearly hours of the past morning, a terrible smell had started \ncreeping from the kitchen, but I couldn't bring myself to go back \ninto that room.  Now, as the sun began to warm the apartment around \nme, the smell began to grow.  It didn't matter though, they should \nbe here before too long.\n\nAs had happened so many times during the last couple of days, my \nmind wandered back to where this had all started.  Closing my eyes, \nI pressed the back of my head against the rough plaster walls, \nuttering a quiet groan from the pain and stiffness that was \nwracking my body. \n\nIt is nearly laughable that my life was ruined because of a car.  It \nwas a 1965 cherry red 'stang.  It was the kind of car that screamed \t\nfor your attention, convertible, and in total mint condition.  It \nwas definitely the car that caught my eye, but it was the woman who \t\nmade me stop.   I always was a sucker for a damsel in distress.  \n\nI guess that my fate was sealed the moment she...\n\n*********************************************************************\nFADE AWAY: A SERIAL STORY PART II (By Kenn Hoekstra, Designer)\n \nI guess that my fate was sealed the moment she... cried out for \nhelp.  I dashed over to the alley where that beautiful Mustang was \nparked and searched around frantically.  There she was, backing \naway from three thugs who were quickly closing the distance between \nthem.  \"Once you're in, you're in,\" the first thug sneered.  \n\"There's no going back now.\"  The second man rapped a lead pipe \nagainst the palm of his hand and just glared at the cowering \nwoman.  God, she was beautiful.  Flowing, white summer dress, \nbeautiful green eyes and long brown hair.  I was wondering if \nI really believed in love at first sight or if I should walk by again.\n\nI tore myself from the power of her charms and lowered my shoulder, \nbarreling into the first man.  He cried out in pain as he crashed to \nthe damp alley pavement.  A spinning kick sent the second man \nsprawling and into a drove of garbage cans. The pipe he was fondling \nclattered to the ground. My fist connected squarely with the third \nman's jaw and sent him quickly to the land of dreams.  I grabbed \nthe beautiful angel by the wrist and pulled her along to the main \nstreet.  She pulled away and climbed into the Mustang, reaching \nover to unlock the passenger door. \"Get in,\" she said.  \"Hurry!\"  \nWhat could I do?  I had no choice at this point, did I? And so I \nclimbed aboard and sealed my fate.\n\nShe slammed on the gas and screeched the tires as we pulled away \nfrom the scene.  Houses were racing by as she continued to stare \nintently at the road ahead, her hand running through her wind blown \nhair.  \"Are you okay?\" I asked.  \"I'm fine,\" she said. \"But you're \nnot.\"  I glanced over at her with a confused look. \"You have no \nidea what you've gotten yourself into...\"\n\n*********************************************************************\nFADE AWAY: PART III (By Chris Foster, Designer)\n\nShe drove around for the better part of an hour, saying nothing.  \nI assumed she'd talk more when she was ready, so I sat back and just \nwatched her out\tof the corner of my eye.\n\nMy mother always warned me about life in the city, but like all \nyoung men looking for a way out of their dull lives - I left home \nat the first opportunity.  My first job was washing cars, the kind of \nwork that leaves your mind free to think and wander.  I had a lot of \ndreams back then.  A lot of nonsense thought up by a gullible mind.\nDreams are for poets and politicians.  I know that now for a \ncertainty.  I've known it since the day I met Destiny face to face \nin a red mustang.\n\nWe reached an empty parking lot on the corner of Third and Chandler.\nNot a good neighborhood.  The streets in that part of town wind around\nthe buildings like those ribbons on balloons and upscale christmas \npresents.  Going nowhere you'd like to end up and somewhere you're \nbetter off not being.\n \nAfter she killed the engine, she reached for the glove compartment \nand began searching. Failing there, and ignoring my curious glance, \nshe continued her search in the back.\n\n\"Oh no\", she said, \"I must've dropped my purse in that alleyway...\"\n\nShe then looked at me.\nThe way a lost child looks at the clerk in a store.\nThe way a puppy looks at you when its been bad.\nThe way a woman looks at a man when she's about to take control of \nhis life...\n \n*********************************************************************\nFADE AWAY:  PART IV (by Pat Lipo, Programmer)\n\n   ...I met that look and gazed deep into those deep green pools, \nand swallowed back my gut reaction, even though it kicked and screamed\nand demanded to be heard.  I've lived every day of my life getting \ninto scrapes, spots and jams, all because I'm a sucker for a woman \nin need.  Well, screw that.  My instinct knew who always got the\nshit end of the toilet brush...\n\n   As I searched my mind for some snappy macho retort, I saw the big\nglistening droplets well up in her eyes.  Damn.  Why do they always\nhave to do that?\n\n   \"But the men... they were coming... and I had to put it... my\npurse...  They can't get it... the key... What if my brother...?\"  \nShe started her sob routine, wasn't making any sense.  That stupid,\nsappy part of me kicked itself free and set up shop.  Granted, she\nwas a babe to end all babes, but in the back of my head I had the\nfeeling that I was being played like Zamfir's pan flute.\n\n   \"All right, lady, I helped you once, I guess I'm stuck with you\nfor now.\"  I hopped out of the car and slid over the hood to the\ndriver's side.  \"I'll drive.  This may get rough.\"  Truth is, she\nhandled the ragtop like a pro.  I just wanted to get behind the \nMustang's wheel and cut loose.  I whipped into a bootlegger and \npushed 70 heading back to the alley, her purse and those thugs.  \n\n   \"We may have to do a quick dash-and-grab if they're still in the\narea.  Hope you're up for it.  What do they call you?\"\n\n   She started to form a word but held it for a split second.  \n\"Julie.  Julie Hanson,\" she lied.  She wasn't very good at it.\n\n   \"All right, Julie.\"  I screeched around a corner, fishtailing \nwildly and just missing the lamppost on the other side.  I made a \nmental note to kick my own ass if I scratched the ride.  Man, it was \nlike driving a dream!  I punched it up to 80 as we catapulted towards\nthe street where I had found her.  \"So what's the big deal with your \npurse?  I assume you're not just worried about cancelling your \nchecks.\"\n\n   She tossed her hair back and gave me a bit of a smile.  \"I left\nsomething in it, something I've got to get back.  If they get...\"\n\n*********************************************************************\nFade Away - Part V (by John Scott, Programmer)\n\n....that key, we are all doomed. Oh great, I thought, just to top it \nall off she is a paranoid too. But let`s face it, it was either this \nor another night in front of the box, yielding to mind numbing \ngameshows interspersed with diabolical attempts to get you to spend \nyour money. \n\n\tI was dying to ask, I just had to. Nothing on this earth \ncould stop me.  \"So, Julie, what exactly is the key for ?\". I tried \nto add an element of apathy to my words, but failed miserably. \"You \ndon`t want to know\", she replied firmly, \"You really don`t want to \nknow\". I kept my eyes on the road, my sixth sense telling me I \nprobably didn`t. We drove in silence for a while.\n\nThis let me do some thinking, quite often a bad move in situations \nlike this. I was trying to clandestinely retrieve an object in a \npublic place in a bright red mustang convertable accompanied by a \ndrop dead gorgeous young lady. Sounds like the kind of stupid move \nyou would read in a 50 cents novel. Ok...taxi..to the bar just down \nthe street...take off my coat....and Julie picks me up three blocks \nsouth...sounds like a plan. Any sign of the thugs and I walk calmly \npast. What could go wrong ? \n\n\tAs she drops me off at the taxi pickup point, she gives me a \npeck on the cheek and wishes me good luck. She certainly knows how to \nget a man to do what she wants. I find it somewhat disconcerting that \nshe doesn`t look back as she speeds away........\n\n\tAfter 20 minutes of waiting on the corner carrying a womans \npurse, looking like some sort of rent boy touting for business, I \nrealise she isn`t coming back. My mind races with possibilities. What \ncould have happened ?\n\n\tWith the first light of dawn, I realise I`ve been up all night \non this wild escapade. The need for a hot drink overcomes me as I see \na coffee shop open just down the road. I`ll think better after one of \nthose, I tell myself, in the vain hope that I could make some sense \nout of this mess....and I still have her purse....\n\n*********************************************************************\nfade Away - Part VI (by Kevin Long, Artist Spectacular!)\n\n\tI push open the weathered door to the coffee shop, a \ntinkling bell above the door announcing my entrance. The \npainted name, peeling and faded, on the door's unwashed glass \nproclaims that this is Joe's Coffee Emporium. Some emporium. Upon \nthe walls, once painted white but now yellowed with nicotine, are \ncheaply framed prints of faraway places faded by the years in \ndirect sunlight. The floor's badly in need of a good mopping. The \nscuffed checker-board linoleum looks to have accumulated fifty \nyears worth of disgusting crud and dried urine. In fact, my shoes \nmake a sickening sucking-squishing sound with every step I \ntake towards the counter. If I didn't need a cup of joe so badly \nI'd high-tail it outta here.\n\n\tI gingerly take a seat at the counter upon a rickety stool \nupholstered in red vinyl. Two seats down from me is a ratty-looking \nbum passed out with his head lying in a plate of half-eaten eggs \nand hash browns. He obivously hasn't bathed in weeks since I can \nsmell his pugnent aroma from here. To bring the point home, a roach \nscurries out of his sleeve takes a look around, forms an opinion of \nthe dingy shop, and returns to the darkness of its host's sleeve. The \nbum is the only other patron besides me.\n\n\tI call out for some service and an elderly woman shuffles from \nthe kitchen area asking, \"What's yer pleasure, mister?\" Like the bum \ntwo seats down, she, too, looks like she could use a good scrubbing \nand hosin' down. Her nametag says her name is Trixie.\n\n\t\"Cup of black coffee for me. Get my pal there whatever he \nwants, too\", I say jutting a thumb in the direction of the comatose \nbum.\n\n\tDrawing my coffee she remarks, \"Think he's already got himself \nwant he wants most... an egg and hashbrown pillow\", and cackles a \nhigh-pitched gale of laughter that turns into a phlegm-spewing coughing \njag. When her coughing finally subsides, she noisily clears the back \nof her throat and spits a big honker onto the floor behind the counter.\n\"That'll be two-bits\", the old hag demands as she sets my coffee \nbefore me. I rummage through my pants pocket and throw a quarter and \na dime onto the counter. \"Keep the change, sweetheart\". She scoops up \nthe coins, rings it up on an ancient cash register, dumps the change \ninto the drawer and slams it shut with a reverberating thud. Trixie \nthen proceeds to wipe down the counter with a rag that's even dirtier \nthan the floor. \n\n\t While I'm sipping my coffee, which is surprisingly good, \nI decide to rummage through the good-looker's purse. Perhaps I \ncan get her address from her license and return her belongings. \nTo be frank, my motives for doing so are not purely of the \ngood-samaritain variety. I find her wallet, open it, and pull out \nher license from a little pocket with a clear plastic window. \nGod...this woman's so drop dead gorgeous even her license photo looks \nlike a Playboy gatefold. Like most people, mine resembles an unshaven \ntroglodyte thats been beaten by a bevy of ugly sticks. Her address is \non 43rd. Not far from here. I return her license back into its clear \nplastic pocket and open the sleeve where her paper money should \nbe. Jesus....there must be over twenty G's here! All in thousand \ndollar bills! Wow...beautiful and rich. I just struck oil, ladies \nand gentlemen.\n\n\tI close up her wallet and slip it into my coat pocket. I'm \nnot stealin' it, mind you, just making sure that much money and her \naddress stays close to me. I resume my invasion of her privacy and \ncome across an old wooden box about the size of my hand at the \nbottom of her purse. The top of the box is intricately craved with \nlittle skeletons intertwined in an orgy of death. Interesting. I \npull at the top to open it and the lid comes free with a hiss of \nescaping air. What the hell! Inside the box, resting on red velvet, is \na mummified hand holding an ornate key carved from bone. Gold in \nelaborate designs is inlaid throughout the length of the key. When \nI try to remove the key from the grisly hand it doesn't budge. Behind \nme, the bell above the door announces another patron to Joe's fine \nestablishment.\n\n\tWhile I'm intently studying the key someone sits between \nme and the bum. God...this guy smells even worse than the bum. I \nlook at my new neighbor and I'm mildly surprised to see that every \ninch of him is completely covered with dirty black cloth, even his hands \nand face. The only openings in his shroud are two eye slits. If he \nhad a sickle I'd swear he was the grim reaper.\n\n\tI'm about to move down a couple of seats to escape the stench \nwhen the \"Reaper\" croaks in a voice from beyond the grave, \"The key. \nGive it to me\", and grabs my wrist holding the box with its treasure. \nI try to snatch my hand back, but his grip is like a steel vice. I \nthink I hear a slight cracking noise emitting from my wrist and the \nshooting pain confirms my first impression. Trying to not let on \nthat he's starting to hurt me, I boldly state, \"Get your own key, \nElephant Man\".\n\n\t\"It is my key\", rasps the \"Reaper\", and snatches the box out \nof my hand before I can even react. Once he has the box, he's up and \nheading for the door. God, this guy moves like greased lightning! \nBefore I'm even off my stool, he's out the door.\n\n\tI crash through the coffee shop door and just catch a glimpse \nof a black shroud rounding the corner into the alleyway next to Joe's. \nI sprint around the corner and almost run headlong into the \"Reaper\". \nHe's bent over the box, staring into its interior which is glowing an \nother-worldly green. I try to sieze the box back, but the \"Reaper\" \nbackhands me across the face sending me flying into a pile of trash \nbags. Damn, that hurt! I jump up and leap at big n' ugly. I mean \nto slug the guy in the kisser, but end up missing when he ducks. \nMy errant fist catches on some of the fabric of his hood and yanks \nit from his head. The \"Reaper\" looks up at me with eyes smouldering \nrage. I'm totally stunned and stammer, \"You! It can't be you. Not \nyou....\"\n\n*********************************************************************\nFade Away - Part VII (By Bobby Duncanson, Designer)\n\n\tThe \"Reaper\" looks up at me with eyes smouldering \nrage. I'm totally stunned and stammer, \"You! It can't be you. Not \nyou....\"\n\n\n\tIt was her! But why I kept asking myself over and over \nagain.  Then her eyes turned emerald green. The same as the box.\nI tried to get back up onto my feet, but she had me in some kind\nof spell...... like I was hypnotized.  I couldn't move anything.\nI tried to yell for help, but nothing was coming out. Everything \nseemed to be in sort of a slow-motion.  I couldn't look away. I \nwas totally immersed.  I thought to myself.....I knew I should have\nordered decafe.  Then suddenly she looked away.....obviously \nsomething caught her attention.  I could hear what sounded like \na car traveling at a high rate of speed down the alleyway. As I \nattempted to stand the car came to a screeching halt.  I couldn't \nbelieve my eyes. It was the red Mustang with Julie at the helm. \n\"That is not possible!\" I yelled out. \"What's not possible?\" she \nreplied as she got out the car.  I turned and looked back to where \nshe once was and she was gone!  Obviously I thought to myself, \nbecause she is standing right in front of me.  But how? This doen't \nmake any sense.  None at all.  I tried to explain to her what in \nhell just happened to me in the coffee shop just around the corner. \n\"Coffee shop?\" she says.....\"that place has been closed for years.  \nA lady named Trixie used to own it.\" \"Use to own it?\" I asked \nconfused as ever.  \"Time is running out so we better get the hell \nout of here while we still have time!\" she said.  \n\n\tBoth of us scurried into the Mustang.  She slammed the tranny \ninto reverse leaving the alleyway like a backwards calvary.  I prayed \nthere would be no crossing traffic as we exited.  She turned the \nwheel right and slammed on the brakes as the front end came swoosing \nout onto the road.  It seemed like we were in a Starsky and Hutch \nmovie with a minor switch in characters.  She then straightened\nthe wheel and floored it. The tires churned out what seemed to \nbe a fog of rubber smoke and a smell that only a mechanic could \nlove.  Then the tires finally caught the pavement and we were off.\nI noticed she was right about the coffee shop.  It was all boarded\nup along with every shop on the street.  I also noticed something \nelse......her purse was right by my feet.  The exit out of the \nalleyway must have jarred it loose from under the seat.  But \nwait a minute.......I never gave her her purse. I noticed a green \nglow emulating from it.  As I reached down to grab it..........\n\n*********************************************************************\nade Away - Part VIII (By Bob Love,  Programmer)\n\nAs I reached down to grab it Julie latched on to my arm with a grip \nof terror. \"Don't touch it, please.\"\n\n\"How did it get here?  I left it back in the coffee shop.\" I \nstopped, confused. \"Or at least it used to be a coffee shop. Now \nit's all boarded up and I'm getting confused.  And I don't like \nbeing confused...\"\n\n\"Ian,\" she moaned to no one in particular, \"will this never end?\"\n\nI grabbed the steering wheel and pulled hard to the side.  Julie \nwas forced to slam on the brakes and stop at the road side.\n\nI could feel the anger that had been brewing in me break loose. \n\"That does it! I want some answers and I want them now.\" I turned \noff the car and grabbed the keys. \"Now you start talking or I'm \nout of here.\"\n\nShe was startled by my outburst but I had to hand it to her, she \ncomposed herself very quickly. \"Very well, you've got a right to \nknow.  The trouble started with my brother, Ian Malcom.\"\n\n\"Never heard of him...\"\n\n\"He's a mathematician of some fame. Or as Ian liked to say, he was \na chaostatitian. He worked in an area of mathematics dealing \nwith when complex systems break down.\"\n\nI nodded for her to continue even though I was starting to feel \nlike a dog whose owner was trying to explain to it how to set \nthe time on a VCR.\n\n\"His latest project was dealing with time/space physics and how \nit could be thrown into a state or chaos - warped if you will.  \nWarped to produce things not known to this universe.\"\n\n\"So you're saying he was studying magic?\" I laughed.\n\nShe seemed lost for a moment.  Looking down at the car floor \nshe mumbled, \"There are more things between heaven and earth...\"\n\nThen her head snapped up and those green eyes of hers glowed. \nShe held up her right index finger, a small yellow flame dancing \nfrom the tip. \"That's exactly what I'm saying.\" \n\nI tried to look unimpressed.\"Nice trick. I saw David Copperfield \ndo the same thing on TV not too long ago.\" \n\nShe grabbed my hand and placed it over the flame that danced on \nher finger. I felt no heat from it.  That just wasn't possible.\n\n\"Okay, so maybe you're telling the truth.\"\n\nShe smiled and continued on as if I "}, {"by": "strife@idsoftware.com", "time": 800856000, "contents": "[idsoftware.com]\nLogin name: strife    \t\t\tIn real life: Strife by Rogue\nDirectory: /nardo/strife            \tShell: /bin/csh\nNever logged in.\nProject: http://pages.prodigy.com/TX/jmonroe/strife.html\nPlan:\n19 May 95\n---------\nTech Notes for those who've asked:\n\tStrife will run under the same operating systems as Doom2.\n\nSTRIFE is a role-playing oriented action game by Rogue Entertainment Inc.\nIt uses an improved version of Doom's excellent engine to bring\nyou an rpg style world.  the levels are seamlessly integrated to\nrepresent a single world of connected maps. you can go back to the town\nagain and again to buy more ammo from the merchant.  or whatever.\n\n[more story when we get time...]\n\ntons more actors, robots, items, and yes, plot and missions.\n\n\ntenative release date:\nFall '95 (This would be Fall in the USA)\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nStrife:  In a world where warfare reigns as the sport of Kings,\nand technology is the best weapon, change begins.\n\n"}, {"by": "strife@idsoftware.com", "time": 811396800, "contents": "[idsoftware.com]\nLogin name: strife    \t\t\tIn real life: Strife by Rogue\nDirectory: /nardo/strife            \tShell: /bin/csh\nNever logged in.\nProject: http://pages.prodigy.com/TX/jmonroe/strife.html\nPlan:\n18 Sep 95\n---------\nTech Notes for those who've asked:\n\tStrife will run under the same operating systems as Doom2.\n\tRuns just fine under Windows 95!  no tweaking needed!\n\nSTRIFE is a role-playing oriented action game by Rogue Entertainment Inc.\nIt uses an improved version of Doom's excellent engine to bring\nyou an RPG style world.  the levels are seamlessly integrated to\nrepresent a single world of connected maps. you can go back to the town\nagain and again to buy more ammo from the merchant.  or whatever.\n\nStrife-  An action / R.P.G. where medieval and high technologies combine to\nform a world where warfare and oppression are a way of life.

We've\nrecieved a early box copy and it looks good.\n\nThere is an updater for a few items that didn't make it into the first\nCD printing, check the Velocity and Rogue web sites for it. It's\navailable right now, and updates Strife to version 1.2.\n\nWe've revised the system requirements a little, which may or may not be\nup to date on the various web sites. The current minimum is a 486DX2/66,\nwith 8MB of free memory. The full install on your hard drive is\nabout 60-70 MB. You can run a smaller install, if you're still in the\nstone age (like some of us), that only takes up about 35MB.\n\nStrife runs fine under Windows 95, but you had better have at least a\n16MB machine. Strife really wants about 7-8MB of FREE memory that it\ncan use. You can physically run it on an 8MB machine under windows,\nbut it will page like a monster, and will run like garbage.\n\nWe are currently evaluating developing ports of Strife to other platforms.\n\n---------\n\nThe Strife Demo is available on the internet at ftp.cdrom.com in\nthe /pub/idgames/misc directory.\n\nVisit the Strife/Rogue Web pages at:\nhttp://www.velocitygames.com/\n\nVisit Rogue's Web page at:\nhttp://www.gamers.org/~rogue/\n"}, {"by": "sverre@ionstorm.com", "time": 910217040, "contents": "\n*** Ion Storm's Finger Server\n\nUser name: sverre\nPlan modified: Wed Nov 04 18:03:44 1998\n\nHey there, I need your help!

Human Head was fortunate enough,\nthrough the good graces of G.O.D. to be able to go to the show and reveal the latest\nversion of Rune to the world.\n\nWe were in a backroom showing the game to invited press and salespeople only, and I have\nto say it was incredible.  First off, we were in a room with FAKK 2 and KISS: Psycho Circus\nwhich was strange enough in itself.  We had the best third party examples of the current\nfront running engines all in the same room showing off their wares, and all three games\nwere published by G.O.D..  This is something I think the press should touch on, since \nall three games looked killer, and showed just what you can do with the current tech by\nmodifying it to your own needs.  We've all substantially added to the base technologies\nand have come up with some unique ways to handle game play issues to match each of these\nengines' strengths.  (I still think our animation engine ruled, however. :) Sorry guys.)\n\nIt was great to finally show off the game play of Rune, and have Ragnar running his paces\nin our ultra-detailed levels.  We showed a cave sequence with steam geysers, bubbling lakes\nof boiling mud, jumping platforms that sunk into the mud based on Ragnar's weight and some\npretty satisfying combat with multitudes of Goblin warriors and the occasional TubeStriker\nthat wanted to eat you for lunch.  We also showed an updated version of Thorstadt (not \n'Orstaff' as one site reported), the city of the Dark Vikings that we first showed at GenCon.\nIt now has particle-based torch and fireplace flames as well as some really subtle and moody\nsound effects. \n\nOverall, Rune is really coming together in ways we didn't dream of before.  We've added \nsubstantially to the Unreal technology base- particle animations, hierarchical skeletal\nanimations, dynamic level of detailing, large mover handling and significant fixes to the\nUnreal Editor that we will easily stay competative by the time we come out.  Plus the \nguys at Epic keep cranking out the improvements to the base technology, which has allowed\nus to really focus on how to put this great game tech into real game design.  We want Rune\nto really rock, and I think were really able to show off our potential for the first time to\nthe world.\n\nThe ECTS demo wouldn't have been possible, however, without the timely assistance of the gang\ndown at The Playing Fields, an ultra-cool LAN game play bar in the Tottenham Court area\nof London.  If you are ever in London and itching to get some multiplayer action and a\npint of some of England's best- they're the place to be!  Thanks to the gang of The \nPlaying Fields for the help and the free drinks on a hot Sunday afternoon in London.  \n\nThanks also go out to Brandon Reinhart, who saved our butts by offering the assistance of \nThe Playing Fields, and for his coming to check us out at the right moment.  Thanks also to\nMark Rein who gave his time and laptop to the cause.  Mark, you look great in front of the \npurple Diablo.  That was my pick!\n"}, {"by": "tgerritsen@humanhead.com", "time": 965780580, "contents": "Welcome to Human Head Studios' Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: Tim Gerritsen\nEmail: tgerritsen@humanhead.com\nDescription: Business Development Director\nProject: All\nWeb Page: Human Head Studios' Web SiteThis plan file is the opinion of the individual who writes it and does not reflect the opinions of the Human Head Studios.\nLast Updated: 07/17/2000 13:29:26 (GMT Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n7-17-00\n\nI want to say a quick congrats to the team at Third Law for getting their first game, KISS Psycho Circus wrapped up and a demo on the net.  They showed me a demo back at E3 and I hope the game does well for them.\n\nI also wanted to let anyone who is attending MacWorld know that we will be showing off Rune at MacWorld later this week in New York.  Westlake has been doing a fantastic job on getting the Mac version of the game up and running.  The game looks awesome, with visuals looking great in RAVE and on VooDoo cards.  I've been playing it on our own iMac Special Edition and it looks awesome.  At the show we'll be running it on a G4 over at 3Dfx and it should scream on the VooDoo 5500's they'll have waiting for us.  Yes, this means you'll get to see Rune in Full Screen Anti-Aliasing (assuming no hiccups in installation on the machines at the show).  \n\nAlso, next month, we plan on showing the game in a much beefier public demonstration at GenCon in Milwaukee.  If you want to see Rune in an alpha state (the Mac demo will still be pre-alpha) come by and check us out at the GOD booth.\n\nAlso check out the free RPG demo rules from our friends at Atlas Games.  They are finishing up the Rune RPG and will have the demo rules at the show to give out at their booth.

I've made this plan \"public\", so people outside of the GarageGames community will be able to see this.  I usually keep my plans local the GG site, but I thought I'd announce the fact that our CVS server is now running, and developers who have purchased the Torque SDK can now access the latest and greatest as it's checked in :)  (Not actually recommended, since the head revision can be unstable, but still cool :) )\n\nThe CVS also contains are first developement checkpoint: Release 1.1, this is not our demo release, that's coming up, but it does include all our work on the demo, bug fixes, etc.  It's been almost three months since release 1.0, so there are quite a few changes.  With the CVS now running, distribution of future release should be a little different, considering everyone will have up-to-the-minute access to our development source :)\n\nMark Frohnmayer's is now fully onboard and cranking out code, it's nice to him up to speed.  With the three of us (Mark, Rick and I) plugging away, the engine is getting whipped into shape in a hurry.\n\nMy changelog since my last plan:\n\n- Fixed profile problem with the mission editor object creator dialog\n- Set playerlist to not activate the cursor\n- Fixed bug with player list not getting updated when a client exits\n- Release 1.1.0\n- Update VC6 ide to reference the nasm in cvs\n- Added nasm to the cvs\n- Fixed/added comments to some of the fps/server scripts\n- Fixed escape disconnect message to reflect local or server connection\n- Removed last bounce snap from rifle bullet casings\n- Moved health bar display from ShapeNameHud to the CrossHairHud\n- Checked in a new footprint\n- Fixed default client connection message to use the torque name\n- Updated VC6 install doco\n- Added new very basic cross-hair hud (I have plans for this one)\n- Renamed vc++ directory to vc6\n- Added new VC6 single unified workspace (torque/vc++/Torque SDK.dsw) for the SDK. Glu2d3d & opengl2d3d dlls now work correctly when built with the new projects.\n- First pass at updating the install and tool docs to use the Torque name.\n- Changed rifle smoke trail to match explosion\n- Removed references to player.h from shapeBase.cc and vehicle.cc\n- Moved all the game fx related objects into the new game/fx dir\n- Moved all the game net objects into a new game/net dir.\n- Moved vehicle code into game/vehicles\n- Fixed mission editor mode button (was broken recently)\n- Cleaned up and added some comments to fps/server/defaults.cs\n- Global rename \"V12 Engine\" -> \"Torque Game Engine\" in *.cc, *.h, *.cs, *.gui\n- Added two new very basic stand-alone hud controls: GuiHealthHud & GuiClockHud.\n- Renamed the ShapeNameHud to GuiShapeNameHud.\n- Temporarily removed HUD example dir (need to find a place for it).\n- Moved AIConnection & AIPlayer (which doesn't compile) into game\n- Changed createCanvas to take the window title as an argument\n- Renamed WorldCraft v12.fgd file to torque.fgd\n- Renamed V12 to Torque in the tools (map2dif, maxExporter, etc).\n- Remove v12.rc\n- v12Game.h and related class changed to demoGame\n- CVS repository renamed to torque\n- Added new ShapeNameHud which display name & damage level ubove shapes\n- Added particles to rifle explosion (still needs work)\n- Added get/set shapeName to ShapeBase.  The name is converted to a tag and is transmitted to the clients.\n- Cleaned up more ShapeBase and Player code.\n\nRick has a first pass at the new sounds system in and running.  There still some work to be done on it, and we haven't put a lot of sounds into our test app yet, but it's nice to have it going.  I was getting tired of the silent treatment.\n\nWe'll be spending the next few days making sure CVS is holding up, and there aren't any major issues with this 1.1 release. After that we'll be full steam on the demo code, more bug fixes, engine cleanup, and of course, new features.  Being able to distribute updates almost instantly with CVS should have a big effect on our development community, this is going to be fun :)\n"}, {"by": "timw@3drealms.com", "time": 983250480, "contents": "Account Name:  Tim Wilson\nEmail address: timw@finger.3drealms.com\n----------\nI'd like to thank the moseleys and hammerdines that chirped up re:detective games, thanks a bunch -- I'm in the process of hunting them down, seeing how the genre has made the leap to gaming  . .. though there is as yet no hard boiled detective shooter \n           *door opens a smidge*\nand that's ok, I guess . . . because for now, I'm completely enamored of Clive Barker's Undying, a great game if ever there was one.

Check it out:\nhttp://hunters.datumplane.com\nMuch thanks to James and Schnoz over at datumplane, they've been working hard, and\nthe site looks great!!!\n\nVersion 1.1 has a few bug fixes (what?!!  bugs in *my* code?), and few new features:\n\n-  The funk that happened when switching from Hunters to another mission type\n   (like CTF) has been cleaned up.  This includes restoring the team names, restoring\n   the team damage voting,\tthat weird message in red that shows up when you switch\n   teams, and the banned inventory items have been reset.\n\n-  Ever notice that once in awhile, your firing is off in \"UndergroundTesting\"?  Well,\n   it's fixed. Don't ask, just be happy  :)\n\n-  Record flag returns are now persisted out to a file, and a new kind of record, the\n   \"Honorary Greed Award\" is given to whoever *dropped* the most flags during that\n   mission.\n\n-  A few other odds and ends - capture messages of 5 or more appear in red now, inv\n   stations are named...\n\nI've also had a few friends send some contributed maps. Matt \"Ptavv\" Timlin sent in a\nmodified version of Bloody vengeance, called \"PavillionOfTheGods\".  It's currently\nrunning on my server \"Kidney Thief's Domain\", and is well worth checking out!\n\nAs I said, it's been a busy week.  TribesCon was last weekend.  Heh, no more \"your an LPB\"\nexcuses!  The weekend was a lot of fun.  Unofficially, I'm going to deny the rumors that\n\"Reckless Abandon\" worked the composite dev team *severly* in an exhibition match.\n(Umm... they *really were* LPBs  :)\n\nWe also *have* to mention that Steve \"Presto\" Eisner bought the dev team BEER!  He's\nworking on some *seriously* cool modifications to his \"Presto Pak\", which we were able\nto see.  You think the original rocked...\n\nWhat else...  yes, Cornboy! is finally going.  My liver can't take any more of his\ngoodbye parties, but the one last Sunday at Nailz' place was pretty intense!  The next\nday at work, my calendar already said Tuesday!  D'oh!!  See ya bud!\n\nWhew!  Well, back to Extreme!\n\n--tinman\n\"Kidney Thief\"\n\n\n\nWednesday, August 11, '99\n\nYARD SALE!!!  That's right!  Hunters is now available!  It's been a long\ncouple of weeks, but its finally here:\nDownload Hunters Now!\n\nAnd to further entice, Eric \"Balefire\" Lanz's Rabbit is right behind me!\nDownload Rabbit Now!\n\nLatest developments:\n\n-  We now have 8 maps for Hunters - including an authentic Cornboy! map.\n   Much thanks Scott!  It's called \"NightTrain\" and it rocks!\n\n-  Record holders are now stored (until the server is restarted) for each\n   mission.  Remember that time when 12 people all killed each other, and\n\tand left you standing dazed in a field of 67 flags?  Your legacy will\n\tnow live on!\n\n-  It seems I've finally decided on a freakin name for that place you return\n   the flags to.  The \"Nexus\" (suggested by Blake Hutchins) seems to work.\n\tIncidently, I've modified all maps to point to the Nexus in observer mode,\n\tfor those who are just starting out, or who can't find it.\n\n-  The guys from www.datumplane.com have kindly offered to do up\n   a \"Hunters\" website.  I can't wait to see it!  :)\n\nFuture possibilites:\n\n\n-   SLEEP!!!\n\n-   A client-side HUD for hunters might come in handy, although I'm sure\n    someone will beat me to the punch.\n\n-   \"Team Hunters\"?!!  Well see...  :)\n\nMuch Thanks:\n-   To the makers of Headhunters for Quake.\n-   To Balefire, for leading by example in his creation of Rabbit.\n-   To Cornboy! for his mission.\n-   To the rest of the Tribes dev team who's screaming and swearing up and down\n    the hall let me know the mission type is a success.\n-   To the faithful core of players who kept my server (Kidney Thief's Domain)\n    in constant use, and provided much valuable feedback.\n-   (in advance) to the guys from Datumplane.\n-   Especially to my Fiancee, Cristine, who had to put up with my tired grumpy\n    butt for the last few weeks.\n\nHappy Hunting!\n\n--tinman\n\"Kidney Thief\"\n\n\n\nMonday, August 2, '99\n\nI am so *stoked* about the number of people who have checked out and\ngiven me feedback on Hunters.  Thanks also to BluesNews, Adrenaline\nVault, Planet Tribes, and anyone else who posted word of it today!\n(To think I had no idea anyone *ever* read my .plan file!)\n\n\nI've made some modifications (mostly in response to feedback) which I\nthought I'd mention - let me know if they help or hinder:\n\n\n-  The biggest drawback is not being able to tell how many flags an opponent\n   is carrying.  I've made an attempt with 2 changes - I've added a column\n   to the TAB menu, and, only a player carrying 5 or more flags has\n\ta flag mounted on his back.\n\n-  Another helpful addition is a function to find out who currently has\n   the most flags, and to track that person with your compass.  To use\n   this function, you must add a key binding to query the server.\n\n\n   To do this, edit your \"config\\autoexec.cs\", and add the lines:\n   EditActionMap(\"actionMap.sae\");\n\tbindCommand(keyboard0, make, control, \"z\", TO, \"remoteEval(2048, HuntersFindTarget);\");\n\n\n   This feature may prove too much, but for now it's nice to have a target.\n\n\n-  Several people have been \"stashing\" - finding a hiding place for their flags,\n   and then capping them all at the end for mega points.  To discourage this\n\tdropped flags will now disappear after 2 minutes.\n\n\n-  The \"cacophony of sounds\" as one person put it, has been toned down.  The\n   pick up flag sound only plays when you're the one picking up a flag, and\n\tthe flag cap sound only plays when someone caps 5+ flags.\n\n\nAgain, thanks everyone, and happy Hunting!\n\n--tinman\n\"kidney thief\"\n\n\nSaturday, July 31, '99\n\nIt's 6:15am, do you know where my mind is?  It's been a busy week.\nThings are progressing well for Tribes: Extreme.  Not that I plan to\ntell you *anything*!  Too bad!  :)\n\nHowever, I finally decided that everyone else was having too much fun\ncreating their own mission types, so I decided to get in on the action.\nI've adapted a new mission type for Tribes:  \"Flag Hunters\"!  (Much thanks\nto the creators of \"Headhunters\" for Quake - I loved that MOD!).\n\nThe object?  Kill everyone of course, but besides that...  Everyone\nspawns with a flag.  If you die, you drop your flag and someone else\ncan pick it up.  If you had picked up several flags before dying, you'll\ndrop them all, plus the flag you spawned with.  The object is to take\nas many flags as you can to the \"alter\".  Scoring is additive,\nso the more flags you bring at once, the higher your score.  e.g.\n1 flag = 1 point, 2 flags = 1 + 2 = 3 points, n flags = 1 + ... + n points.\n\nThis hasn't been released, so the only server you can play this on is:\n\"Kidney Thief's Domain\"  (address \"IP:198.74.33.53:28001\")\n\nSo...  check it out.  Keep in mind that I'm not a mission designer, so\nI'd appreciate any *suggestions* about which maps (I've set up 5) work,\nwhich need improvement, and which just plain suck.  Also, any bugs.\nPlease keep in mind that this was just a pet project, and not\nan officially sanctioned Dynamix release.\n\nA final note, if you live within travelling distance of Seattle,\ncheck out http://tribescon.teamplay.net for an upcoming tournament.\n(And while you're there, if you like \"Flag Hunters\", you can buy\nme a beer!  :)\n\nThanks all.  Happy hunting!\n\n--tinman\n\"Kidney Thief\"\n \n\n\nMonday, July 26, '99\n\nNow that I'm sober enough to type again...  on Friday, we received\n5 cases of our favorite Mirror Pond Pale Ale!  Did you hear me?  I\nsaid WE GOT BEER!!!  Much thanks to Diane Lee and Wasif Azmat!\n\nA couple of new developments:  Frohny and I have coded up a debugger\nfor the Tribes 1.7 patch.  Check out Mark Frohnmayer's .plan file\nfor the details!\n\nNext, I've been feeling sorry for the HUD scripters out there, so\nI've added a few minor changes in the hopes that their lives will\nbecome easier.  The class: \"FearGui::HudCtrl\" has been fixed up to\nbe used to drag HUD components around.  In addition, 2 new functions\nhave been provided:  Control::setPosition(ctrl, x, y); and\nControl::setExtent(ctrl, w, h);  This will allow you to resize and/or\nreposition elements on the fly.\n\nAnother *extremely cool* development, our lead QA, Eric \"Balefire\" Lanz\nhas created a new mission type: \"Rabbit\".  It's currently only available\non the \"Pacific NW T1\" server.  The object is to grab the flag, and run\nlike hell while all the other players try to hunt you down.  Once the\n\"rabbit\" is dead (insert cautionary label for female players here), the\nnew \"rabbit\" is whoever can grab the dropped flag.  All waypoints are set\nto the rabbit to increase the hunt intensity.\n\nThat's all for now...  back those five cases of beer...  um..  I mean work.\n\n--Tinman\n\"Kidney Thief\"\n\n\n\nFriday, July 02, '99\n\nRecovering well from Canada Day celebrations - as one of the *very*\nfew Canadians here, we really have to make up for it!\n\nA recent development in Tribes has been the MOD developed by a \"Rasia\",\na gamer who has taken it upon himself to script a new mission type\ncalled \"Arena\".  The game play is that of a team deathmatch.  It is\n*awesome*!  If you get a chance, check it out.\n\nI've been abducted!  I'll be joining Tribes: Extreme for the next\n3 or 4 months so help out with the AI development.  I'll let you know\nmore as soon as I do.  All I can say is that our bots are going to be\n\"Sofa King BaddAss!\"  :)\n\n--Tinman\n\"Kidney Thief\"\n\n\n\nMay 17, 1999\n\nI suppose it's about time I updated my .plan file.\n\nGood news for all you budding Tribes scripters!  Recent developments\nfor Tribes2 will make scripting a *whole* lot easier.\n\nI've been impressed by some of the additional HUDs that people have\ncreated.  My favorite, and one I use frequently is \"MadHud\", found\nat http://www.planetstarsiege.com/madhud.\n\nAfter talking with several scripters involved, the limitations they\nhave faced, such as very limited font selection, difficult graphics\ndisplay methods, and a general shortage of creatable functional\nobjects, should be a thing of the past.  Object creation is no longer\nnecessary through the \"newObject();\" function with it's limited\nparameter specs.  Any GUI object can now be \"instantiated\", and *any*\nof it's properties can be specified.  This includes specifying font\nsize, color, and style, and having access to base objects which may,\nfor instance, be draggable, outlined, translucent, etc...\nThe bad news?  You'll have to wait for Tribes2!\n\nOn a personal note, SHE SAID YES!  Cristine Otazu, my girlfriend of\n2 1/2 years has agreed to marry me on July 29th, 2000.  The wedding\nwill be in Victoria, B.C., and then off to Hawaii for a couple of\nweeks.  It's going to be a busy year!\n\n--Tinman\naka \"Kidney Thief\"\naka \"Thulsa Doom\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"by": "tinman@dynamix.com", "time": 945192720, "contents": "Message of the Day:\n\nWelcome to the Dynamix Finger Server!\nbe sure to check out http://www.dynamix.com\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nUser Name: tinman     Plan Last Modified: 12/14/1999 10:01:20 PST\n\nReal Name: Tinman  (Yes, dammit, that is my real name!)\nEMail: tinman@dynamix.com\nJob: humble programmer\nProject: Starsiege: Tribes2\n\n\nMonday, December 13, '99\n\nThis fall has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride, so I thought it was about\ntime to do another update.  The cancellation of Tribes: Extreme was of course,\ndissappointing.  Being part of the AI team, we had some great successes with the\nbots - there were some levels I worked on and playtested for hours, and am very\nsorry to see that they can't be released.  But thinking of what we'll be able to\ndo with an extra couple of months - I can't wait.  Tribes 2 will leave everyone\nwith no doubt that concentrating our efforts on one product, *without* having to\ncut features because of such \"Extreme\" time constraints, will pay off bigtime!!!\n\nOn a happier note, an improved Hunters1.3 is now available!\nThe highlights are:\n\n-  Three new missions have been added.  PandorasBox by Matt \"Ptavv\" Timlin,\n   ValleyOfTheWolf by Tyler \"MITTENMAN\" Sten, and PathOfDaggers by Eric \"Griffon\" Soulvie.\n   Much thanks guys - especially for how much work I made you all do\tuntil your\n   levels got the golden \"thumbs up\"!\n\n-  The official website for Hunters has moved to http://www.tribesplayers.com/tribesplayers/hunters\n   Much thanks to \"Starlord\" and \"Schnoz\" from Datumplane (R.I.P.) for all their\n   hard work and support!\n\n-  When a person has picked up enough flags to break the current record for\n   that map, an announcement goes out to everyone.  Hopefully this will paint\n   a bullseye on him and make setting a record just a bit harder!  :)\n\n-  A minor bug fix: for people who call: remoteEval(2048, HuntersFindTarget);\n   to find a target, if they set themselves an alternate waypoint, it would be\n   overwritten once the previous target picked up another flag.  A new function\n   has been written to cancel the auto-targetting.\n   Execute: remoteEval(2048, HuntersCancelTarget);\n\nOne final thing while I'm in the mood to ramble.  I'm very proud of a successful\nsubterfuge I pulled on my buddy \"Bacchus\".  He ICQ'd me one night asking for some\nscripting help.  I send him back a script which didn't quite work on his end, so\nhe sends me his autoexec.cs file for me to verify that he copied it correctly,\nor to make any necessary changes.  It was at this point that I noticed he also had\na set of custom chat messages - things like \"Can someone fix our Generator?\" or\n\"D'oh - I just got killed!\".  Well, I (tried to) fix his scripting problem, and sent\nhim back an editted autoexec.cs.  Unfortunately, the script still didn't work, but in the\nmiddle of the next match he played, he found himself saying things like \"Can someone\nfix our Generator?  Kidney Thief kicked our ass again!\", and \"D'oh - Kidney Thief just\nkilled me again - he's just too damn good!\".  Hehe  sorry bud - couldn't resist!  :)\n\nAnyways - back to work for me.  Thanks all, and since I probably won't have time to\nupdate again this month/year/decade/century/millenium, have a Merry Christmas and A\nHappy New Year!\n\n--tinman\n\"Kidney Thief\"\n\n\n\nMonday, August 30, '99\n\nAnother quick update from the world of Hunters - version 1.2 has been released!\navailable here as always.  :)\n\nUpdate:\n\n-  A bug in the voting to change mission has been fixed.  (The one that causes people\n   to no longer drop a flag when they're killed.)\n\n-  Those annoying beacons that trip you up in corridors - they now exists underground!\n\n-  The spamming caused by someone running over a large amount of flags all at once\n   has been reduced.\n\n-  GREED mode!!!  A new (votable) feature which requires a minimum number (default is 8)\n   of flags that a person must have before they can return them to the Nexus.  This seems\n\tto help especially in games with fewer people.\n\n-  HOARD mode!!!  Another new (votable) feature.  Anyone who's played on my server has\n   probably played against \"Sooshie\" - the guy who runs the auto-whine-about-lag script!\n\thowever, props are due - he suggested a \"winner takes all\" game, which inspired this\n\tmode.  The HOARD period begins at 5 minutes left in the game, until 2 minutes left.\n\tDuring this period, *no* flag returns to the Nexus are permitted at all.  Just watch\n\tthe jackpots build!\n\nThanks again all...  Happy hunting!\n\n--tinman\n\"Kidney Thief\"\n\n\n\nFriday, August 20, '99\n\nJust a quick message...

My favorite, and one I use frequently is \"MadHud\", found\nat http://www.planetstarsiege.com/madhud.\n\nAfter talking with several scripters involved, the limitations they\nhave faced, such as very limited font selection, difficult graphics\ndisplay methods, and a general shortage of creatable functional\nobjects, should be a thing of the past.  Object creation is no longer\nnecessary through the \"newObject();\" function with it's limited\nparameter specs.  Any GUI object can now be \"instantiated\", and *any*\nof it's properties can be specified.  This includes specifying font\nsize, color, and style, and having access to base objects which may,\nfor instance, be draggable, outlined, translucent, etc...\nThe bad news?  You'll have to wait for Tribes2!\n\nOn a personal note, SHE SAID YES!  Cristine Otazu, my girlfriend of\n2 1/2 years has agreed to marry me on July 29th, 2000.  The wedding\nwill be in Victoria, B.C., and then off to Hawaii for a couple of\nweeks.

If you haven't checked out the new site (www.shogo-mad.com), do it NOW! It's got a new AVI that completely rocks, new art, and a ton of new screen shots.\n\nThe team is entering the \"vortex\" stage, where everything is just coming together faster and faster, ultimately funneling into a pinpoint known as a gold master of the game. It's exciting to see the enthusiasm and dedication that everyone is displaying, and it is really starting to show in the game. On the level side, it's all about getting the levels finished for beta, which is approaching quickly. We're right on track, and the 14 hour days for the next 2 months will make them that much better. You guys won't be disappointed. Check out the new screen shots, and the AVI on the page, and you'll see what I mean.\n\n-Todd\n\np.s. must be a lotta H freaks out there.

However, Linux binaries will be\navailable very soon after the PC game hits store shelves.  There are no plans for boxed Linux games.  \nMore remains to be done for the OSX version of DOOM 3 and that will take some time.  We won't release\nthe OSX version until it's just as polished as the PC version.  The date for OSX DOOM 3 remains \"when it's\ndone\", but I can confirm that it's definitely coming.\n\nDemo:  our priority was finishing the game first and now we are turning our attention to the demo.  I \ndon't have any information to share regarding any specific content, but I don't believe that we have \never disappointed in that regard in the past.  We will release the demo as soon as it's done, but this\nprobably won't happen until after the game has arrived on U.S. store shelves.\n\nLast, but not least, the id Store:  we will have copies of DOOM 3 available, but only after we get them.\nI'm sure that some of the hardcore game retailers will get them even before we do.  Check our website for\nupdates on this.  We certainly appreciate everyone who has helped to make the id Store a huge success this\nyear.  By the way, more DOOM 3 T-Shirts just arrived, so those popular items are back in stock and will be\navailable this week.\n\nI understand that people have lots and lots of questions.  We're working on pulling together some form of\nan official FAQ, but even though we're done we still have several responsibilities that are urgent as the\ngame heads for retail.

Personally, I'm looking forward to watching the world's \nfirst official Quake III Arena tournament and getting to see\nand meet many of you in person.  We're expecting a capacity \ncrowd, which I'm guessing could be the largest \"convention\"\ntype event ever held in Mesquite (a town not known for large\nconventions).\n\nAlong those lines, I wanted to advise everyone who may be making\nthe trip of exactly how full the area will be.  First, if you\naren't on the attendance list, you won't be able to get in to\nthe convention/conference.  The whole event is being administered\nlike a concert or sporting event:  if you don't have a ticket, you \nwon't gain admission, regardless of who you know or how far you\ntraveled to get here.\n\nAlso, if you don't have accomodations at this point and are planning \non attending, you need to make reservations immediately if you want \nto stay in Mesquite.  There are only a few hotels in the immediate \narea and I understand that all of them are already at or near capacity.\nDallas is a big city and has lots of places to stay, so if you\ncan't get a room in Mesquite there are alternatives, but you may\nhave to pay a premium and drive a few miles.\n\nEveryone have a safe trip coming to Texas and I look forward to\nseeing you there!\n\n6-30-1999\n\nAdrian and I were checking out our local Electronics Boutique\nand we spotted the QII action figures out on the shelves for\n$2.99 for all of the figures except for the Tank, which was \n$7.99.  I know a bunch of people have been looking for these\n(especially the Tanks, which were so hard to find), so here's \na chance to get them on the cheap.  Adrian bought a Tank figure,\nsince we only have a couple in the office.  We were amazed that \nthey had the Tank figures in, and at less than 8 bucks it was \njust too cheap to pass up.\n\nAlso, Quake II for the N64 is now out.  EB had at least one copy\nin that had arrived this morning\n\n5-19-1999\n\nThis update is relevant only for all magazines, CD bundlers,\ncoverdisk makers, and shareware bundlers.\n\nI have been getting a number of requests for permission to \ninclude the Q3Test on various types of CD's.  Please note\nthat this is expressly prohibited in the End User License \nAgreement for Q3Test.  The test is to be redistributed by \nelectronic means *only*.  That means no CD coverdisks, no CD \n\"shareware\" compilations, no zip disk distribution, or any \nother form of distribution other than Internet mirrors and\nother means of electronic file transfer.\n\nWe have been very clear that this test is not meant for\nmass public distribution and should NOT be considered a\n\"demo\".

There will be less than 30,000 of the tin box editions \navailable world-wide, so if this is something you want you probably\nneed to get your order in ASAP.  I don't have a picture to post, but\nif you were at QuakeCon and saw the metal box in the black display\ncase, you know what the box looks like.\n\nJust to clarify a few things that may be confusing:\n\nWe won't be selling these direct from id - it's purely a retail promotion.\nThere is no difference in the game content, only the box is different.\nSome retailers are charging more for the tin box, and some are charging\nthe same price.  The actual retail price of the game is something that\nis out of our direct control, but we aren't charging the retailers more\nfor the limited edition box.  I don't have a full list of all of the\nretailers world-wide, but in the U.S. EB, Babbages, and CompUSA are\nall participating at a minimum.  Availability may vary by store, however.\nThe release date for Quake III Arena is, as you know, \"When it's done!\"\nRetailers are notorious for posting \"official\" release dates, but unless\nit comes directly from id, it's just speculation.\n\n10-19-1999\n\nActivision just informed me that Quake II for the Playstation made its\ndebut on the UK PSX charts at No. 5.  The game was primarily developed\nby a UK company called Hammerhead which did just a tremendous job on the\ngame.  They had a ton of assistance from us primarily via Tim Willits.\nThe official UK Playstation Magazine (UK OPM?) gave the game a rating \nof 10 out of 10!  If you have a Playstation this is a must-have game.\n\n10-15-1999\n\nTo put this rumor quickly to rest, we don't have any tracks from Nine Inch\nNails in the current Q3A soundtrack.  Trent spent most of his time this \nyear completing his latest album (you can still call them that, right?),\nand is now preparing for touring, if he's not already doing it.\n\nAs far as what is really in the soundtrack, I'm going to wait until it's\nfinalized to go into details, but we have some great music from names\nmany people will recognize.\n\n9-14-1999\n\nIf you have a copy of the new October CGW, turn to pages 14-15 to see\nmy nomination for \"Game Ad of the Year\".\n\n8-26-1999\n\nIn the aftermath of the Ottawa Sun article, I was forwarded the link\nbelow by Bernd Kreimeier:\n\nhttp://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/05/06/game_violence/index.html\n\nThis is an excellent article that addresses how Grossman misrepresents \nthe scientific data.  It's not a new article, but it's worth a read if \nthe subject interests you.\n\n\n8-25-1999\n\nWell we've all seen the brilliant journalism of the Ottawa Sun (or\nwhatever it is).

That was Paul's first real level he built for Quake\n2 and as a first time level it's simply amazing with its vertical scale\nand complexity.  Second, I would also like to add that Brandon did a ton\nof clean-up and monster placement work for the Waste unit and the Mine\nunit.  At id no one person does all the work on any given map.  Because\nthe design of Quake 2 was so large and complex a team effort was needed to\nget everything finished. When you look at a list of names and maps you\ncan't really understand everything that went into creating them. For\nexample, the \"security\" map was originally started by me, it was later\npassed on to Christian to finish. After I realized that I needed to add a\nconnection to \"mintro\" from it, I took it back to add an end.  When I was\ndone with that it returned to Christian to add a basement area. Then the\nlast day before we shipped I changed the top area again. As you can see I\nbuilt its foundation, but Christian also added a ton of stuff to it.\n\"Security\" isn't the only map with such a long history - power1, mintro,\nhangar1 (especially), and hangar2 all have similar stories. The list of\nmaps and names in Romero's .plan reflects the person who built the level's\nfoundation but does not reflect all the clean-up and tweaking done by the\nothers. If anyone has a question about a map feel free to ask any\ndesigner, chances are they did some work on it and can answer your\nquestion.\n\nI want to publicly thank and congratulate all the designers here that\nworked so hard to make such an awesome game. No one person could have done\nwhat the team did. We have become so strong as a team and I believe we\nwork so wonderfully together that I can not wait until we get started on\nthe mission pack.\n\n-Tim\n\n"}, {"by": "twillits@idsoftware.com", "time": 931789920, "contents": "Welcome to id Software's Finger Service V1.5!\n\nName: Tim Willits\nEmail: twillits@idsoftware.com\nDescription: Level Designer\nProject: Quake 3 Arena\nLast Updated: 07/12/1999 11:09:02 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs you have heard, we are working on releasing another version of the test. This new \nversion of the test will require you to download all of the data again. Many of you might \nnot immediately see this as a good thing, but it is!!! This gives me the opportunity to \nmake some minor bug fixes to Q3test1. If there is anything in the map that you feel is a \n\"bug\" please drop me an email and I'll try to fix it before the next test release.\n\nExamples of some good bug fix suggestions: \n\n1. Sometimes when I round the corner out of the rocketlauncher room towards \nthe plasma room I see a vis error at the top of the steps.\n2. I get stuck when I back into the corner on the left side of the steps leading up \ntowards the rocketlauncher in the courtyard.\n\nExamples of some bad bug fix suggestions that I DON\"T want you to email me:\n\n1. This map plays nothing like Q3test2 and it basically sucks.\n2. Make it more like the Edge, that's my favorite map!!\n3.

Not to mention\nloony's burgeoning kick-ass Tekken 3 skillz, which were giving me\nsome problems! He seems to be making the transition to 3D fighting games\namazingly well! ;)\nBut, I got my revenge and then some, last night when we deathmatched the\njust released Heretic II Expansion Pack! (Nice transition, eh?)\nHead to HereticII.com and download the Heretic II EP, and the six all-new EP DM Maps! Lovin' it!\nIf you can't download the files right away,\nbe sure to try the mirrors.

What are these, you may ask? Well, they\njust sort of came about of their own accord. They're what I call particular\nhosted sites that offer definitive help, knowledge, and / or file resources.\nThey're precipitated by, and dedicated towards a particular need in the\ncommunity. In the same way Shrines provide necessary resources on your journey\nthrough Parthoris within Heretic II, these help to build up the community and\nmake it better, which is what we're all about. I'd like to extend an invitation\nto anyone else out there who has an idea for a Heretic II Resource Shrine.\nPut together a temporary site online (note: please don't send me a ZIP of your\nsite! ;-), and send me an email with the URL to take a look at it, and I just\nmight host it.

For the first two weeks, the\napartment I moved into had been undergoing renovations in both the kitchen and\nbathroom, but the end result is definitely worth all the mess and disturbance\nit caused during that time. Likewise, the new area here at the Raven offices\nis finally coming to fruition, and I'll be getting all settled in to my very\nfirst real office later today! w00 h00!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Tues., Mar. 2, 1999]\nWe know the natives are getting restless, so we thought we'd give you a word of\nassurance.\nRight now, the EP is done. Jake (The Gent) Simpson has finished with the coding\nthat I observed him working on first-hand yesterday. The EP has been turned\nover to QA for one, hopefully final session of bug inspection. But this won't\nbe a week-long QA thing - although, obviously no one involved is about to\nrelease a buggy EP, which is why this process has gone on as long as it has.\nBut as you can tell, things are wrapping up, and you should be playing the EP\nVERY soon now!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Mon., Mar. 1, 1999]\nHi, my name is William Mull. I'm known online as Phoebus, and my friends and\nfamily call me Bill. In the future, I'll be using my .plan file to help keep you\ninformed on all the projects we're working on here at Raven. But for whoever's\ninterested, I'll begin with a quick summary of how I came to work for Raven\nSoftware.\n\nI worked for a year and a half as Activision's Online Production Coordinator.\nThree weeks ago today, in fact, I transferred to Madison, WI to work full-time as\nRaven Software's Website Administrator. It has been quite a journey from the\ntime I first discovered computers, which lead to the spark that changed my life,\nthe first time I played Wolf3D, and when I first successfully connected via modem\nwith my buddy in Doom. Which lead me to discover Heretic and Hexen when\nthose games were released. At the time, of course, I had no idea that I would\neventually find myself here at Raven, working for the developers of the games I\ntruly love the most.\n\nAfter receiving my undergrad degree in English at the University of Georgia, I\ndecided to get my Master's in something to do with computers, and decided on\nInstructional Technology. Although I earned my Master's degree with honors, I had\nalready come to the conclusion around the halfway point, that what I really\nwanted to do didn't directly involve my course of study in the least. But it did lead\nto me teaching myself HTML and becoming consumed with the computer gaming\nscene. All of this came at a the right time for me, having played bass guitar in\nthe late 80's in the local music scene in Athens, GA (Seven Simons, Kilkenny Cats,\nand Lotus Eaters). I look back fondly to that ten year period of my life, with lots\nof great memories and no regrets. But, I realized that I didn't want to pursue the\nproverbial \"Rock and Roll Dream\" anymore, right around the time I first\ndiscovered computers.\n\nI've been involved with Raven for quite a while now, ever since Hexen II was first\nannounced on the Net. At that time, I was running my first website, Cult of\nPhoebus. Raven asked me to redesign their site, and I become their webmaster,\nwhich was my first big break in the gaming industry. My next website,\nHexenWorld, was very much a labor of love. Along with Bakshra, Richard\nConnery, Upaboveit, Filth, and other online peers from those very early days of\nthe fledgling and often-troubled Hexen II scene, I've had the unique pleasure of\nhelping build from scratch and nurture an entire community.\n\nIn addition to helping to develop websites for all of Activision's games, I\ncontinued working on my own to improve Raven's online presence. I have always\nbeen connected and devoted to Raven. When they asked me if I'd be willing to\ntransfer to Wisconsin and become their Website Administrator - a new position\nhere, created for and by me - it didn't take me very long to reply in the\naffirmative. Now that I'm here, although I'm still getting settled in, I have come\nto realize that this is the creative environment I've always dreamed of working in.\n\nIf you'd like to get in touch with me, or check out what I've been working on\nlately, here is my email auto-sig., which should give you a good idea of the sites\nI'm now officially working on for Raven Software:\n\nWilliam (Phoebus) Mull\nWeb Site Administrator\nRaven Software\nwmull@mail.ravensoft.com\n\nRaven Software Network\nhttp://www.ravensoft.com\nhttp://www.Soldier-of-Fortune.com\nhttp://www.Raven-Games.com\nhttp://www.HereticII.com\nhttp://www.HexenWorld.com\n\nThanks to everyone in the community I've come to know and love. Your loyalty\nhas greatly benefitted myself, the games, and Raven as a company. And I'm very\nglad to be here to tell you that. Stay tuned for more great things to come!\n"}, {"by": "wmull@mail.ravensoft.com", "time": 938017500, "contents": "Welcome to Raven Software's Finger Service V1.6!\n\nName: William Mull\nEmail: wmull@mail.ravensoft.com\nDescription: Website Admin\nProject: General\nLast Updated: 09/22/1999 13:12:26 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[Wed., September 22, 1999]\nThe poem was, of course, a metaphor.\nIt wasn't meant to be taken as a literal\nreference, but however the reader perceived it\nbased on their own personal experiences.

I'm\nhappy to report that my relationship with Laure,\nmy girlfriend for over a year now, continues to be\na very wonderful, stable aspect of my life.\n\nFor those of you who really wanted to know, \"My\ncruelest mistress\" is, in fact, California :-)\n\nThis Friday the 24th is officially my last day\nat Raven. Quite out of the blue, I received a\nfew job offers from promiment gaming companies\nbased in California. After some consideration,\nI have accepted a position in northern\nCalifornia. and I look forward to the new\nand exciting opportunities for advancing my\ncareer, and enjoying the atmosphere of\nSilicon Valley, bay-bee!\n\nI'm not leaving Raven out of any ill will towards\nthis great company, nor any of the incredibly\ntalented people who work here. Thanks to them\nfor the many great experiences I've had working\nfor the developer of some of my favorite games.\n\nI'm looking forward to the new challenges my\nnew job brings, as well as getting back to\nCalifornia, just in time, as the bitter cold\nbegins to creep in, here in Wisconsin. :-)\n\nI'll continue to maintain all of the game\nsites: HexenWorld, HereticII.com,\nSoldier-of-Fortune.com, and Raven-Games.com,\nwith the involvement of the fans of the game, but\nthey'll quite naturally revert back to their\nprevious unofficial status, just as they were\nbefore I came to Raven.\n\nIf anyone needs to get in touch with me,\nemail me at my phoebus@hexenworld.com address.\nI'll be sure to get in touch, once I'm all\nsettled in.

The result of this bug is that Quake 3 will \nprint \"Invalid CDKey\" when you exit the game, reload it, and try to connect \nto servers on the net.\n\n I was able to replicate this issue in-house and have mailed the programmers.\n\n If you wish to save yourself some aggravation while testing this release, I \nwould suggest the following after you've ensured that q3key contains your\nvalid CD-Key;\n\n- If you are an MS-DOS h4x0r, CD to your quake3\\baseq3 directory and execute\n\"attrib +r q3key\" at the command prompt. This will make the q3key file \nread-only (after you are certain that it contains your valid CD key.)\n\n- If you are not comfortable using the command prompt, open up \"My Computer\"\nand head over to the directory where you have Quake 3 installed. Open the \"baseq3\"\ndirectory, right click on the \"q3key\" file. Select \"Properties\" and on the bottom\nof the panel, you should see a \"Read-only\" check box. Check that, and hit \"Ok\" to \napply the changes.\n\n We'll get this issue resolved in the next release.\n\n Thanks again for helping us test out this release, and please remember to mail\nbugs@idsoftware.com if you come across any further issues.\n\n Cheers,\n\n -Xian\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n*** Disclaimer: Opinions are my own and in no way reflect those of id Software\n\nThis disclaimer does not cover misuse, accident, lightning, flood, tornado,\ntsunami, volcanic eruption, earthquake, hurricanes and other Acts of God,\nneglect, incorrect line voltage, improper or unauthorized use, broken antenna\nor marred cabinet, missing or altered serial numbers, removal of tag, \nelectromagnetic radiation from nuclear blasts, sonic boom vibrations, customer\nadjustments that are not covered in this list, and incidents owing to an\nairplane crash, ship sinking or taking on water, motorvehicle crashing, \ndropping the item, falling rocks, thieving lawyers, crazy ex-girlfriends, \nleaky roof, broken glass, Y2K bug, mud slides, forest fire, or projectile \n(which can include, but not be limited to, arrows, bullets, shot, BB's, \npaintball, shrapnel, lasers, napalm, torpedoes, or emissions of X-rays, Alpha,\nBeta and Gamma rays, knives, stones, etc.). \n\n---\n"}, {"by": "ykiem@nihilistic.com", "time": 969659040, "contents": "Nihilistic Software\nwww.nihilistic.com\n\nUser Name.........ykiem\nFull Name.........Yujin Kiem\nLast NT Logon.....Friday, September 22, 2000 at 09:58\n"}, {"by": "zak@ritual.com", "time": 923217900, "contents": "\n*** Ritual Entertainment's Finger Server\n\nUser name: zak\nPlan modified: Sun Feb 07 21:19:38 1999\n\nYou have reached Zak Belica, Music and Sound Guy\nzak@ritual.com - zak@nwlink.com\n\n-2/7/99-\nUm, it's been a while since the last update!

I'm the point on q3feedback, so the soonest I'll be picking up\nemail is Sunday, so don't expect a response the next few days!  You can\ncatch us at the Activision booth if you want to let me know in person just\nhow long you had to wait for the Win32 test.\n\nAnyone with tapes of last weeks X-Files?\n\nThe main issues we're seeing are:\n\n3Dfx drivers seem to be pretty darn difficult.  About 50% of the emails\ncomprise of 3Dfx issues including BSOD on NT, crashing during level changes,\nand crashing due to in game mode changes.  We're working with 3Dfx on this.\n\nThe next biggest problem is that people run the game without running GLSETUP\nto update their drivers.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.\n\nPeople claim that the TNT slows to a crawl when you in-game change the video\ncolor depth to 32bpp, but it's fine after a restart.\n\nThere's a \"lag trap\" quirk of firing the plasma gun 12 times at a wall, as\npeople approach it the overdraw slows their systems and makes them\nvulnerable to hits.\n\nThere's a lot of people trying to run the game with 32mb of RAM.\n\nSetting everything to \"highest\" (highest resolution, color depth, etc.)\ncauses artifacts on the TNT.\n\nAlt-TAB on a Matrox G200 causes the system to crash.\n\nA lot of people wrote to let us know that they just love the game.\n\nThe main game feedback seems to be:\n\n1. the new railgun sucks / and / or is / awesome.\n2. the game is too slow / too fast.\n3. make it more like quake 1 / quake 2.\n4. the rockets are too slow / too fast.\n5. people die too slow / too fast.\n6. the graphics are awesome / too cartoony.\n7. don't touch a thing / change everything.\n\n5/10/99\n\nHere (at long last for most of you) is Q3Test version 1.05.  We've worked long\nand hard to get this to you and we look forward to your feedback on what's\nright and what's wrong with it.\n\nThere's one known issue with the Linux dedicated server taking up way too much\nCPU time.  As other known issues come to light we'll try to keep you all in the\nloop.  Please try and email q3feedback with a good sensible subject line, mention\nwhat sort of system/OS you have, and remember that humans read all the feedback.\n\nGLSetup will have it's own press release sometime later this evening, but we're\nvery excited to be part of this venture.  But I'll let Chris Hecker tell you all\nabout it.\n\n5/10/99\n\nIMPORTANT!\n\nYou must completely nuke your old Q3TEST install before installing the update.\nThe config files from the old build are BAD voodoo.\n\nYou can also type \"exec democycle\" to watch a bunch of id people play the map.\n\n\n5/10/99\n\nQ3Test 1.05 is DONE!\n\nNew Linux/Mac versions are going up right now, and we're finishing up the installer\nfor the Win32 version.\n\nIf all goes well, the Win32 version will follow in a few hours (few == six or so).\n\n5/9/99\n\nWe're getting closer, but I think it'll be tomorrow before we're out.\n\nInternally we're bashing on the new maps, code, servers, and clients.  There is a\n/lot/ of new stuff in there and we want to bang on it for a bit before we release.\n\nWe are building installers, pak files, and so forth, so our confidence level is good,\nbut since it's only been 15 minutes since the last bug fix (which was a doozy of a\nfind BTW) and the new maps are still being bsp'd.  All of this makes a release tonight\nseem like a bit of a risk.\n\nIf all goes well we will bash on it tonight and tomorrow, and once John gets in\ntomorrow we'll be ready to go.\n\n5/7/99\n\nWe're looking to release Q3Test for Win32 on May 19th.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nWe're approaching what we consider a good build on Q3Test for Win32, and our current\nestimate, barring any problems, is that we will release it on Sunday evening.  We will\nrelease Q3Test updates for Mac and Linux a few hours before Win32 to check for any\nbonehead issues.\n\nThere will be completely new data for this version of the test, old versions will not\nbe compatible with the new version, and old and new servers do not mix.\n\nIf things change I'll let you all know.  But this is the current plan.\n\n5/1/99\n\nRent day and I need to pay!\n\nI see several people are going for the master server right now.  That's fine, but\nwe're changing the format of the server pretty radically over the next few days so\nthe packet size will be nice and small and queries can be more detailed.  If you're\na hacker out there and you want to email me with suggestions, that's cool.\n\nWe will be publishing the specs to the master server and MOTD server really soon, we're\nanxious for people to look over that stuff.\n\n4/30/99\n\nThe G3 firmware update is at:\n\nhttp://asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11361\n\n4/29/99\n\nWe're about to update (tonight) the executables to 1.03 of q3test, there is a\nseperate download for win32 and mac that just contains the updates, and the\nmain files have been updated as well.  Win32 is still only available as a\ndedicated server.\n\nWe're also releasing the Linux version of q3test, this will available as a RPM\nand as .tar.gz.\n\nIf you have a G3 system, I highly recommend the new firmware update from Apple,\nthat gave us a noticeable (to humans) framerate improvement.\n\nHere's the update list:\n\n\nMac specific\n------------\nimproved networking stability\nimproved device scanning\nimproved speed\nimproved memory checking\nimproved sound latency\n\nGeneric\n-------\nglobal motd/update server\nadded drop shadow to field characters and fixed scrolling\nfixed edge-of-bounce-pad misprediction error (server side)\nremoved broken weapon-stay dmflag\nmade menu gfx never picmip\ncheat protect r_lightmap\ncheat protect r_nocurves\nclear sound buffer before any file IO\ncontinuous scoreboard / ping update when tab is down\nput version number on menu background\ndim out behind floating menus\nfixed server crashing string bug\nadjusted scoreboard for 8 players\nshow hostname on connection screen\nfixed null model warning on startup\nmore space for hostname on local servers screen\nsv_privateClients, sv_privatePassword\n\"server is full\" message on connect screen\narchive handicap in config file\n\n\n4/26/99\n\nHere's the most common bugs we're getting.  The first two bugs account for\n75% of all the bugs we're getting.

If all goes\nwell tonight, it will be out over the weekend.  The Linux/Win32 builds are not yet ready.\n\nThe test version of Quake 3 Arena is just that, a test, and as such we here at id software need\nto have some controls over it as we start to test it out publicly.  Without these controls we\ncannot actively track and improve the product in a manageable manner.\n\nWe wanted, and are eager to be completely \"out there\" on all platforms, but the OpenGL drivers\nthe product needs for all the platforms are not yet finalized.  By launching on the Mac first it\ngives the various 3D board manufacturers some time to get their Win32 OpenGL 3D drivers certified\nwith Microsoft.  We're using, and depend on, the latest and greatest drivers and want to be able to\ndistribute those drivers for the Win32 platform.\n\nThe Macintosh market is smaller than the Win32 market, and has less configuration options than the\nLinux market.  There is only a single OpenGL driver, and the hardware is essentially always the same.\nThis is an ideal \"controlled\" environment for the initial testing.  Basically, if there is a huge\nissue with the initial release we're exposing a smaller audience to it.  This turns out to be a good\nthing.\n\nThe plan is to release the Macintosh version first, followed by the Linux version, followed by the\nWin32 version.  We will release on the other platforms as soon as possible.  We will rev the other\nplatforms as we make new releases.\n\nI hope you understand and agree with this decision/process.  It is a good step towards a timely\nrelease of the full demo and retail product.\n\n4/23/99\n\nNo news is good news they say!  We're still working hard to get the test out.  If you could refer\nquestions to me (zaphod@idsoftware.com) regarding the test I'd appreciate it, everyone else here\nis plenty swamped.  Obviously if it's just \"when?\" then that is pretty hard to answer, because \"when\"\nwill be as soon as it's done!\n\nBut watch this space and remember to follow the white rabbit.\n\n4/14/99\n\nWe're getting closer to releasing the test version of Quake 3 Arena.  It's worth going\nover our expectations from the test vs. the world's expectations from the test.  I appreciate\nall the voice mails, faxes, and emails with suggestions, death threats, and comments, and I\ndo read each and every one of them.  I try to respond to a lot of them, but obviously I can't\nrespond to them all.\n\nAt this point, we still have no release date on the test.  We're testing builds here and at\nActivision and continuing to go through cycles.  As soon as feedback from both internal testing\nand our testers at Activision dies down, we'll be ready, but while this is providing heavy\nreports, as it still is today, we're still not ready to come out with the public test.\n\nThere will be two maps in the test; these maps will also be in the final product.  The feedback\nwe're looking for is specific to the technology in the test.  We're pretty happy with the design,\nand feedback on things like weapon switch times, models, gibs, and so forth are not things we'll\npay as much attention to as real issues with the technology.  We're looking closely at modem, ISDN,\nand cable play to see how our new network code works, and how that works when a bunch of different\nconnections are playing together on the same server.  We're anxious to gauge server load and use\nwith the maps we have to see how the server works under heavy use, and to make sure we've got a lot\nof the new client/server communication working reliably and securely.\n\nThat said, we do and will watch you play, read the message boards, and try to gauge feedback.  But\nthe main thing to remember is that this is a test technology build, not a demo, there will be a\ndemo, we plan on a demo, but this is a test.  A lot of you will want to wait on the demo rather than\nplaying the test.\n\nThe test will be on all three platforms, Mac, Linux and Win32.  We're still working on minimum and\nrecommended specs.  There are no bots in the test.  We do plan on revving the test once it's out at\nregular intervals to get fixes out there.\n\nThere is no spoon.\n\n3/28/99\n\nI know a lot of you are looking at the end of the month as a fixed date for q3test,\nbut we're probably looking to be within a few weeks of that date rather than exactly\non it.  We're working on it; I just want to keep expectations in line with reality.\n\nThis is a test of Quake 3:Arena, not the demo.  With this test we're looking to see\nhow well the brand new networking and graphics code works, and while we've run this\nthrough a QA process here and at Activision, this is not code that is of release\nquality in speed or gameplay.  Please do not look upon this as the \"demo\" of Q3A.\n\nThanks.  I now return you to your regular programming.\n\n3/2/99\n\nXian says I need to put something new here.\n\nIt's been a busy two weeks, and I've yet to get any furniture.\n\nThoughts later."}, {"by": "zaphod@idsoftware.com", "time": 928603500, "contents": "Welcome to id Software's Finger Service V1.5!\n\nName: Graeme Devine\nEmail: zaphod@idsoftware.com\nDescription: Some Guy\nProject: \nLast Updated: 06/05/1999 13:50:22 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6/05/99\n\nMailbombs suck.

A series of misunderstandings between id and Tom's Hardware has led\nto a \"vs.\" benchmark war.  We're cool with Tom, and he's cool with us.  We're\nboth going to move on and start over afresh.\n\nI just don't understand why my Riva 128 isn't more popular...\n\n6/03/99\n\nOkay.  Wow.  The Linux community has far exceeded any kind of expectations\nI had on feedback!  I've been blown away.\n\nMike Warfield and Mark Hazen helped me out on the Samba timestamp problem.\nIt seems RH 6.0 is compiled with a special fix for mounting Win95 drives,\nbut that causes issues with NT and Win98 drive mounts.  The solution is to\nrecompile the kernel.\n\nSeveral people helped me out with the compile of smbmount.c, and in the end\nI got that going by adding a #define NR_OPEN 1024 at the beginning of that\ncode.\n\nOn the email front, and I think this is one of the ongoing gating issues to\ntrue corporate use of Linux.  A lot of people use VMWare to run Win32 apps\nthat have no equivalent in Linux land yet.  Out of them all, XEmacs + VM\nseems to be the most stable/complete solution, and perhaps that will make\nit's way to my desktop, but I don't see that making it way onto everyones.\n\nIt seems to me that if someone wrote a bunch of Java apps using the Swing\nUI we could have very nice cross platform tools that worked in every\nOS we had to boot in the office.\n\nMore than anything, I'm just blown away by how positive the community is.\n\nQ3Test answers.\n\nYes, it should have SMP support, there are some issues with it (on some\ndrivers), so it's not enabled by default.\n\nJoystick support is mostly there, but John is still working on a couple of\nthe more interesting flavors.\n\n6/02/99\n\nWe're working on a new Q3Test update, no schedule other than \"soon\", but the\nfixes are almost all internal.  We've still got a few issues we want to get\ngoing internally at id (notably multi-network machines).\n\nBrian is leaving, and I just want to wish him well.  He shall be missed.  We're\nnot going to be bringing anyone else in during Quake3 development.\n\nI'm a bit behind on feedback email and it's all Lilith and Eve's fault.  I\nwent to watch their show over the weekend and Realplayer said I needed to\nupgrade, so I did, and since then I've been toast.  I'm sure it's not\nRealnetwork's fault, there's simply too much beta about my Windows install\nto make it safe for things like DLL files.\n\nSince then I've shifted to Linux (RedHat 6.0) as my major desktop.  No more\nWin32!  My questions to the techies amongst you are:\n\n\t- we've had issues with Linux machines randomizing timestamps on Win32\n\t  filesystems when we use smbmount to mount NT servers.  How do we fix\n\t  this?  I'm unable to get smbmount to compile in the Samba 2.04b (it\n\t  errors out with a bad identifier -- NR_OPEN).\n\n\t- the email client situation is not quite on par with Win32.  Netscape\n\t  seems the nicest, but KMail, Balsa, and others I've looked at seem\n\t  to be in active development and not quite ready for solid use.  Is\n\t  this the case?  I like Outlook type interfaces over Pine type \n\t  interfaces.\n\nI looked online, usenet, and other misc. mailing lists, but wanted to see\nwhat real world people out there are using and doing.\n\n5/12/99\n\nOff to E3.  I'm the point on q3feedback, so the soonest I'll be picking up\nemail is Sunday, so don't expect a response the next few days!  You can\ncatch us at the Activision booth if you want to let me know in person just\nhow long you had to wait for the Win32 test.\n\nAnyone with tapes of last weeks X-Files?\n\nThe main issues we're seeing are:\n\n3Dfx drivers seem to be pretty darn difficult.  About 50% of the emails\ncomprise of 3Dfx issues including BSOD on NT, crashing during level changes,\nand crashing due to in game mode changes.  We're working with 3Dfx on this.\n\nThe next biggest problem is that people run the game without running GLSETUP\nto update their drivers.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.\n\nPeople claim that the TNT slows to a crawl when you in-game change the video\ncolor depth to 32bpp, but it's fine after a restart.\n\nThere's a \"lag trap\" quirk of firing the plasma gun 12 times at a wall, as\npeople approach it the overdraw slows their systems and makes them\nvulnerable to hits.\n\nThere's a lot of people trying to run the game with 32mb of RAM.\n\nSetting everything to \"highest\" (highest resolution, color depth, etc.)\ncauses artifacts on the TNT.\n\nAlt-TAB on a Matrox G200 causes the system to crash.\n\nA lot of people wrote to let us know that they just love the game.\n\nThe main game feedback seems to be:\n\n1. the new railgun sucks / and / or is / awesome.\n2. the game is too slow / too fast.\n3. make it more like quake 1 / quake 2.\n4. the rockets are too slow / too fast.\n5. people die too slow / too fast.\n6. the graphics are awesome / too cartoony.\n7. don't touch a thing / change everything.\n\n5/10/99\n\nHere (at long last for most of you) is Q3Test version 1.05.  We've worked long\nand hard to get this to you and we look forward to your feedback on what's\nright and what's wrong with it.\n\nThere's one known issue with the Linux dedicated server taking up way too much\nCPU time.  As other known issues come to light we'll try to keep you all in the\nloop.  Please try and email q3feedback with a good sensible subject line, mention\nwhat sort of system/OS you have, and remember that humans read all the feedback.\n\nGLSetup will have it's own press release sometime later this evening, but we're\nvery excited to be part of this venture.  But I'll let Chris Hecker tell you all\nabout it.\n\n5/10/99\n\nIMPORTANT!\n\nYou must completely nuke your old Q3TEST install before installing the update.\nThe config files from the old build are BAD voodoo.\n\nYou can also type \"exec democycle\" to watch a bunch of id people play the map.\n\n\n5/10/99\n\nQ3Test 1.05 is DONE!\n\nNew Linux/Mac versions are going up right now, and we're finishing up the installer\nfor the Win32 version.\n\nIf all goes well, the Win32 version will follow in a few hours (few == six or so).\n\n5/9/99\n\nWe're getting closer, but I think it'll be tomorrow before we're out.\n\nInternally we're bashing on the new maps, code, servers, and clients.  There is a\n/lot/ of new stuff in there and we want to bang on it for a bit before we release.\n\nWe are building installers, pak files, and so forth, so our confidence level is good,\nbut since it's only been 15 minutes since the last bug fix (which was a doozy of a\nfind BTW) and the new maps are still being bsp'd.  All of this makes a release tonight\nseem like a bit of a risk.\n\nIf all goes well we will bash on it tonight and tomorrow, and once John gets in\ntomorrow we'll be ready to go.\n\n5/7/99\n\nWe're looking to release Q3Test for Win32 on May 19th.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nWe're approaching what we consider a good build on Q3Test for Win32, and our current\nestimate, barring any problems, is that we will release it on Sunday evening.  We will\nrelease Q3Test updates for Mac and Linux a few hours before Win32 to check for any\nbonehead issues.\n\nThere will be completely new data for this version of the test, old versions will not\nbe compatible with the new version, and old and new servers do not mix.\n\nIf things change I'll let you all know.  But this is the current plan.\n\n5/1/99\n\nRent day and I need to pay!\n\nI see several people are going for the master server right now.  That's fine, but\nwe're changing the format of the server pretty radically over the next few days so\nthe packet size will be nice and small and queries can be more detailed.  If you're\na hacker out there and you want to email me with suggestions, that's cool.\n\nWe will be publishing the specs to the master server and MOTD server really soon, we're\nanxious for people to look over that stuff.\n\n4/30/99\n\nThe G3 firmware update is at:\n\nhttp://asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11361\n\n4/29/99\n\nWe're about to update (tonight) the executables to 1.03 of q3test, there is a\nseperate download for win32 and mac that just contains the updates, and the\nmain files have been updated as well.  Win32 is still only available as a\ndedicated server.\n\nWe're also releasing the Linux version of q3test, this will available as a RPM\nand as .tar.gz.\n\nIf you have a G3 system, I highly recommend the new firmware update from Apple,\nthat gave us a noticeable (to humans) framerate improvement.\n\nHere's the update list:\n\n\nMac specific\n------------\nimproved networking stability\nimproved device scanning\nimproved speed\nimproved memory checking\nimproved sound latency\n\nGeneric\n-------\nglobal motd/update server\nadded drop shadow to field characters and fixed scrolling\nfixed edge-of-bounce-pad misprediction error (server side)\nremoved broken weapon-stay dmflag\nmade menu gfx never picmip\ncheat protect r_lightmap\ncheat protect r_nocurves\nclear sound buffer before any file IO\ncontinuous scoreboard / ping update when tab is down\nput version number on menu background\ndim out behind floating menus\nfixed server crashing string bug\nadjusted scoreboard for 8 players\nshow hostname on connection screen\nfixed null model warning on startup\nmore space for hostname on local servers screen\nsv_privateClients, sv_privatePassword\n\"server is full\" message on connect screen\narchive handicap in config file\n\n\n4/26/99\n\nHere's the most common bugs we're getting.

We'll probably do something\ncompletely different based on stories of the Quake 3 Bus and the Nevada desert.\n\n9/1/99\n\nSome of you have commented on the master server being a bit odd right now.\nIt's actually running just fine, it's just responding to queries for protocol\n41, which is not entirely compatible with protocol 40.  Only servers with\npeople on there will actually show up.  You can force showing the empty\nservers with the keyword \"empty\", but this isn't so useful since in 1.08 you\ncan't combine that with game types (e.g. you can't say \"empty tourney\").  For\ncompleteness's sake, you can also say \"full\".  But heck, if you type in \"nude\nreptiles\", you can scan that too and get exactly zip.\n\nAll of this is of course fixed in the new test and browsing gametypes,\nkeywords, and so forth is easier than ever.  You'll swoon.  Trust me.\n\nFor those of you, and there's a bunch of you, who believe that our previous\nefforts had better network support than 1.08, we've set up servers here for\nyou to get side to side experiences.

Forty-five minutes later we\nhad \"fun\", which has remained interestingly addictive throughout the last week\nto the entire company (of course, listening to Tim tell this story, it's down\nto thirty-five minutes while he had no power, and the mouse was disconnected\nfrom his machine).\n\nThe lesson from all this is either that Tim really values something fuzzy to do\nwith lunch, or that Quake 3 is so darn cool you can toss together maps in less\nthan an hour.  Okay, maybe knowing what Tim knows helps, so we're going to dissect\nhis brain for science and get him working as our own personal AI (John swears it's\npossible) churning out 24 levels a day 24/7 until some odd Y2K bug causes him to\nmake every telephone in the world ring at once.

Please try and find cheat exploits and report them to us!\n\nAlso, keep in mind that this is a test, and not the final product.  There's a lot\nin the test which is very temporary, so while we've taken great pride in\nputting out very solid test releases, we're still working hard on the final\nproduct and very much appreciate your feedback (q3feedback@idsoftware.com)\nin getting this product right for you - the players -\n\nI get a bunch of feedback from people wanting this product to be more like\nQuake 1 or Quake 2, while others look for us to innovate and make something\nbrand new.  Quake 3 is arcade deathmatch, nothing more and nothing less.  It's\nnot Quake 1 nor Quake 2, but does nod it's head in the direction of the online DM\nversion of both those products (and apparently pissing off both parties at the\nsame time).\n\nLook to the next id product to give you the \"brand new\" gameplay and world.\nQuake 3 Arena will keep basically with what you've seen and read about up\nuntil now and it's now time to put this one to bed.\n\n7/19/99\n\nNot tonight.  We're fixing the cheat exploits.  Users who downloaded the current\nbuild should expect a 3-5 meg update (so you don't have to download the\nwhole thing).\n\n7/19/99\n\nOkay.  More.  Must Sleep Soon.\n\nWe're testing a new version of the build right now that has some new stuff in it:\n\n- the ; key now remains bound (for all you lefties)\n- the timescale exploit has been plugged (again, actually this was in the last\n  version of the test and a lot of people were silently using it)\n- LAN servers display properly\n- IPX is working\n- the enabling cheat exploit has been fixed\n- CPU time for servers should be nicer\n- an exploit in the tourney map has been filled\n- joystick support (there is no conspiracy here, but this might require more time\n  to fix than just tonight)\n\nWe're looking to get win32/Macintosh out there, hopefully tonight, but probably\ntomorrow by the time we're through checking all this out.\n\nBTW, I finished DK2 (with Adrian screaming at me most of the time to build a bigger\ntorture chamber).\n\nTHAT GAME ROCKED!\n\n7/19/99\n\nSOCKS Proxy Support\n\nThere are five cvars that control it. They are only settable from the at init\ntime (from the OS command line).\n\n+set net_socksEnabled 1\n+set net_socksServer \n+set net_socksPort \n+set net_socksUsername\n+set net_socksPassword\n\nPlease note that you use the address (name or IP number) of the SOCKS server\n(firewall machine), NOT a Q3ATEST server. The port number defaults to 1080,\nyou should not need to change this.\n\nIt supports no authentication and username/password authentication method\n(RFC-1929); it does NOT support GSS-API method (RFC-1961) authentication.\n\n7/17/99\n\nSome variable things we missed or are hard to find in the readme:\n\ng_gametype\n\nA value of 0 here indicates classic \u00c2\u0093Free For All\u00c2\u0094, a value of 1 indicates\n\u00c2\u0093Tournament Play\u00c2\u0094 and a value of 2 indicates \u00c2\u0093Team Deathmatch\u00c2\u0094.\n\nSo, to start a dedicated server in tournament mode, you would use:\n\nquake3 +set dedicated 2 +set sv_zone tournaments +set g_gametype 1 +map q3tourney\n\nThe warmup time for tournament play is set with g_warmup.  A tournament\ngame is implicitly a one on one match, and further players are automatically\nentered as spectators (note, when the game starts, all clients, including the\nspectators respawn).  You can follow the players by using \u00c2\u0093team follow1\u00c2\u0094,\n\u00c2\u0093team follow2\u00c2\u0094, and you can be a scoreboard by using \u00c2\u0093team scoreboard\u00c2\u0094.\n\nWe appear to have broken joystick support somewhat between the first IHV\ndrop and the final release of the test.  We\u00c2\u0092ll address that (so don\u00c2\u0092t start the\nemail bombardment on it!).\n\nExpect the master server to be up and down over the weekend, now we have\nprotocol 38 servers out there in large numbers we\u00c2\u0092re able to tune that stuff so\nit works a wee bit better.\n\nThanks for the support!\n\n7/16/99\n\nOkay, it's there (as I'm sure you all know).\n\nI'll update tomorrow on how to set up servers in zones so you can easily\nfind/check/get to servers in groups.  It's a nifty new feature.  Until then\nI'm sure you'll all be slamming each other down on Xian's excellent new\ntournament map.\n\nAs usual, send bugs to q3feedback@idsoftware.com\n\n7/16/99\n\nA new build of q3test (win32) has been constructed in your workshop.\nThat's a little DK2 joke there...\n\nWe're hacking on it a bit before it's public, but it's looking good to go!  I'll\nupdate my plan file once it's out and fill you all in on what's new.\n\nGood bug find by Sherman Archibald today for all you Riva 128 owners.\n\n7/16/99\n\nYou can all go to sleep.\n\n7/9/99\n\nSo who\u00c2\u0092s the best at id?\n\nWe were playing Xian\u00c2\u0092s new tourney map (it will be in the next release of\nq3test) within the company and Tim decided it would be a hoot to have a mini\nid \u00c2\u0093tournament\u00c2\u0094.  We huddled in the observation room watching (and shouting\na great deal) match after match unfold in the new spectator modes until the final\ngame.  Everyone at id played and when they weren\u00c2\u0092t playing, they were watching\nand cheering intently.\n\nSo who\u00c2\u0092s the best?\n\nJohn \u00c2\u0093The Terminator\u00c2\u0094 Carmack won quite handily, convincing us all further that\nthere really is some code in there that says \u00c2\u0093If (player==Alloy)\u00c2\u0094.  Second place\nwent to our esteemed CEO Todd \u00c2\u0093Hold Still Dammit While I Frag You\u00c2\u0094 Hollenshead.\nThe rest of us where suitably humbled\u00c2\u0085(but we all claimed it\u00c2\u0092s because we work\nso much).\n\nIt was a good test of the tournament code and great fun.  We will be doing the\nsame thing in-house again soon since the method led to some good changes.  Next\ntime however, there will be a few changes.  The emergency phone call to Todd from\nActivision is already planned, and we\u00c2\u0092re thinking the arrival of a new Ferrari catalog\nmid game for John will throw him off for the required microseconds to remove the\nball from his mouse.\n\nSo where\u00c2\u0092s that darn test?\n\nLike the Great Prophet Zarquon said, \u00c2\u0093all sorts of things popped up\u00c2\u0094.  It\u00c2\u0092s still \u00c2\u0093soon\u00c2\u0094.\nWe need to merge code, test, and do a drop to IHVs to make sure everything is\nhunky-dory with them.  The tourney map needs a wee bit more tweaking, and some\nof the tourney code needs a little bit more work and testing.  There\u00c2\u0092s a lot of new\nstuff in there!\n\nBTW, Dungeon Keeper 2 is one of the best games I\u00c2\u0092ve played in a long time.  It's not\ndelayed the test at all.  Honest.\n\n6/21/99\n\nWe had the Ion Storm guys over last week to play a little deathmatch, and while\nI won\u00c2\u0092t say who won between Romero and Killcreek, I can tell you it wasn\u00c2\u0092t the\nmale of the species.  But boy, can those Ion guys talk smack.\n\nThe reason we asked them over was to have them check in on the status of our\ntournament map, which we hope to get out there soon with the next version of the\ntest (to give you all time to practice on it before QuakeCon, you are going to\nQuakeCon right?).  We\u00c2\u0092re also looking at a /lot/ of bug fixes, changes, and tweaks\nso we\u00c2\u0092re gearing up for your feedback.  I\u00c2\u0092ll let Chris Hecker speak for glsetup,\nbut we\u00c2\u0092re looking to get that updated and support for 3Dfx in there.\n\nSoon can be defined as soon.  And that\u00c2\u0092s probably not this week.\n\n6/05/99\n\nMailbombs suck.  They can cause delays and make it hard to find the meaningful\nemails from the noise.  Please stop.  I can't even read the language the email is\nin to know what it says!\n\nOkay.  A series of misunderstandings between id and Tom's Hardware has led\nto a \"vs.\" benchmark war.  We're cool with Tom, and he's cool with us.  We're\nboth going to move on and start over afresh.\n\nI just don't understand why my Riva 128 isn't more popular...\n\n6/03/99\n\nOkay.  Wow.  The Linux community has far exceeded any kind of expectations\nI had on feedback!  I've been blown away.\n\nMike Warfield and Mark Hazen helped me out on the Samba timestamp problem.\nIt seems RH 6.0 is compiled with a special fix for mounting Win95 drives,\nbut that causes issues with NT and Win98 drive mounts.  The solution is to\nrecompile the kernel.\n\nSeveral people helped me out with the compile of smbmount.c, and in the end\nI got that going by adding a #define NR_OPEN 1024 at the beginning of that\ncode.\n\nOn the email front, and I think this is one of the ongoing gating issues to\ntrue corporate use of Linux.  A lot of people use VMWare to run Win32 apps\nthat have no equivalent in Linux land yet.  Out of them all, XEmacs + VM\nseems to be the most stable/complete solution, and perhaps that will make\nit's way to my desktop, but I don't see that making it way onto everyones.\n\nIt seems to me that if someone wrote a bunch of Java apps using the Swing\nUI we could have very nice cross platform tools that worked in every\nOS we had to boot in the office.\n\nMore than anything, I'm just blown away by how positive the community is.\n\nQ3Test answers.\n\nYes, it should have SMP support, there are some issues with it (on some\ndrivers), so it's not enabled by default.\n\nJoystick support is mostly there, but John is still working on a couple of\nthe more interesting flavors.\n\n6/02/99\n\nWe're working on a new Q3Test update, no schedule other than \"soon\", but the\nfixes are almost all internal.  We've still got a few issues we want to get\ngoing internally at id (notably multi-network machines).\n\nBrian is leaving, and I just want to wish him well.  He shall be missed.  We're\nnot going to be bringing anyone else in during Quake3 development.\n\nI'm a bit behind on feedback email and it's all Lilith and Eve's fault.  I\nwent to watch their show over the weekend and Realplayer said I needed to\nupgrade, so I did, and since then I've been toast.  I'm sure it's not\nRealnetwork's fault, there's simply too much beta about my Windows install\nto make it safe for things like DLL files.\n\nSince then I've shifted to Linux (RedHat 6.0) as my major desktop.  No more\nWin32!  My questions to the techies amongst you are:\n\n\t- we've had issues with Linux machines randomizing timestamps on Win32\n\t  filesystems when we use smbmount to mount NT servers.  How do we fix\n\t  this?  I'm unable to get smbmount to compile in the Samba 2.04b (it\n\t  errors out with a bad identifier -- NR_OPEN).\n\n\t- the email client situation is not quite on par with Win32.  Netscape\n\t  seems the nicest, but KMail, Balsa, and others I've looked at seem\n\t  to be in active development and not quite ready for solid use.  Is\n\t  this the case?  I like Outlook type interfaces over Pine type \n\t  interfaces.\n\nI looked online, usenet, and other misc. mailing lists, but wanted to see\nwhat real world people out there are using and doing.\n\n5/12/99\n\nOff to E3.  I'm the point on q3feedback, so the soonest I'll be picking up\nemail is Sunday, so don't expect a response the next few days!  You can\ncatch us at the Activision booth if you want to let me know in person just\nhow long you had to wait for the Win32 test.\n\nAnyone with tapes of last weeks X-Files?\n\nThe main issues we're seeing are:\n\n3Dfx drivers seem to be pretty darn difficult.  About 50% of the emails\ncomprise of 3Dfx issues including BSOD on NT, crashing during level changes,\nand crashing due to in game mode changes.  We're working with 3Dfx on this.\n\nThe next biggest problem is that people run the game without running GLSETUP\nto update their drivers.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.\n\nPeople claim that the TNT slows to a crawl when you in-game change the video\ncolor depth to 32bpp, but it's fine after a restart.\n\nThere's a \"lag trap\" quirk of firing the plasma gun 12 times at a wall, as\npeople approach it the overdraw slows their systems and makes them\nvulnerable to hits.\n\nThere's a lot of people trying to run the game with 32mb of RAM.\n\nSetting everything to \"highest\" (highest resolution, color depth, etc.)\ncauses artifacts on the TNT.\n\nAlt-TAB on a Matrox G200 causes the system to crash.\n\nA lot of people wrote to let us know that they just love the game.\n\nThe main game feedback seems to be:\n\n1. the new railgun sucks / and / or is / awesome.\n2. the game is too slow / too fast.\n3. make it more like quake 1 / quake 2.\n4. the rockets are too slow / too fast.\n5. people die too slow / too fast.\n6. the graphics are awesome / too cartoony.\n7. don't touch a thing / change everything.\n\n5/10/99\n\nHere (at long last for most of you) is Q3Test version 1.05.  We've worked long\nand hard to get this to you and we look forward to your feedback on what's\nright and what's wrong with it.\n\nThere's one known issue with the Linux dedicated server taking up way too much\nCPU time.  As other known issues come to light we'll try to keep you all in the\nloop.  Please try and email q3feedback with a good sensible subject line, mention\nwhat sort of system/OS you have, and remember that humans read all the feedback.\n\nGLSetup will have it's own press release sometime later this evening, but we're\nvery excited to be part of this venture.  But I'll let Chris Hecker tell you all\nabout it.\n\n5/10/99\n\nIMPORTANT!\n\nYou must completely nuke your old Q3TEST install before installing the update.\nThe config files from the old build are BAD voodoo.\n\nYou can also type \"exec democycle\" to watch a bunch of id people play the map.\n\n\n5/10/99\n\nQ3Test 1.05 is DONE!\n\nNew Linux/Mac versions are going up right now, and we're finishing up the installer\nfor the Win32 version.\n\nIf all goes well, the Win32 version will follow in a few hours (few ="}, {"by": "zaphod@idsoftware.com", "time": 948484260, "contents": "Welcome to id Software's Finger Service V1.5!\n\nName: Graeme Devine\nEmail: zaphod@idsoftware.com\nDescription: Some Guy\nProject: \nLast Updated: 01/21/2000 15:30:11 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1/21/97\n\nJust read the PQ article.  Yes, that was an awesome game, I think it was a little\ncloser than the score indicated.  We're itching for a rematch!  I've never had\na game with so many excellents and impressives over my head, and for it to\ntake a full 50 minutes was something else, it was truly riveting.\n\nBTW, I didn't mean we're not going to play CTF vs. anyone anymore, just that\nwe're not playing right now.  We have to do some work sometimes!\n\n1/21/98\n\nOkay, we're not playing CTF anymore.\n\n1/20/98\n\nid vs. the world ctf at 192.246.40.223.  id is red, world is blue.\n\n1/17/99\n\nMr Elusive just put together some bot editing documents, the file is available\non our ftp server:\n\nftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/tools/Q3ABotEdit.zip\n\nWe've been following the whole DLL vs. VM debates, and id is firmly on the side\nof using VMs for game mods.  We will be addressing the \"auto swap\" VM\ndepending on which server you go to quickly (this was a bug) but I think we\nwill be strict on saying that people should use VMs over DLL files.  The next\nexecutable release will probably have a warning screen come up that you will\nneed to agree to and click through if the game is about to load a DLL.\n\n1/14/99\n\nOkay.  I see a lot of people with \u00c2\u0093awaiting CD Key authorization\u00c2\u0094 questions.\n\nIn almost all cases, this is due to the IP address of the authorize server\nbeing wrong because the hosts file on the client has somehow been altered.\nYou can test to see if this is your problem by going to a DOS prompt and\ntyping the following:\n\nping authorize.quake3arena.com\n\nIf you get the following, then your system has an invalid entry somewhere\nredirecting the authorize requests to the wrong IP address.\n\nReply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=32\nReply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=32\nReply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=32\nReply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<10ms TTL=32\n \nIf you\u00c2\u0092re running Windows 95/98, then in almost every case editing the file\ncalled \u00c2\u0093hosts\u00c2\u0094 which resides in your c:\\windows (or wherever you\u00c2\u0092ve installed\nwindows) directory and removing any lines that mention\nauthorize.quake3arena.com can fix this.\n\nVarious cracks and CD key gen utilities (none of which actually work) appear\nto be the culprit, adjusting your hosts file without your knowledge or\nconsent.\n\n1/12/99\n\nI just finished making the Macintosh point beta release.  It'll be on the usual mirrors\nsoon.\n\n12/21/99\n\nHere's the cliffnotes version of most of the bugs we're looking at.  I'll make\nthe actual feature database available as HTML at somepoint soon so\neveryone can take a look as to what issues we're addressing.\n\n- New scoreboard.\n- New team scoreboard\n- Voting can change the gametype if the new map doesn\u00c2\u0092t support the current gametype\n- Misc icon fixes\n- Team overlay tidied up\n- Spectators can go through doors\n- Late player start on screen score display fixed\n- Re-add mouselook\n- Callvote nextmap\n- Extra/different pakfile disconnect bug fixed\n- Packetloss on the scoreboard\n- Delay deferred loading of players until after death\n- Server browser remembers \u00c2\u0093show full\u00c2\u0094/\u00c2\u0092show empty\u00c2\u0094 status\n- Server browser will not refresh on stopped lists\n- Show IP address in server browser\n- Compressed sound support\n- JPEG from disk support\n- Cache filefind results so we do not requery the filesystem every load\n- Make 10.x.x.x and other public addresses not use auth server\n- Protect CD key into a different file\n- Improve overall error reporting to user\n- Make sure everyone can command the bots\n- Load/Save config re-added\n- Bots don't start kill, hitnokill, or hitnodeath chats when there are nearby enemies\n- Awaiting snapshot/gamestate issues resolved\n\n12/21/99\n\nWhile I've been out with the rest of the world trying to get a Barbie Cash\nRegister for my daughter, I have actually been doing a bit of work!\n\nActivision's release QA process found two bugs in the Mac build that I felt\nimportant enough to fix.  One bug was in the client, and the other in the\ninstaller.\n\nI fixed them both last night and Activision has a new master candidate.\n\nI've heard sporadic reports that the Mac demo has problems, but I've yet\nto be able to repeat that issue here.\n\nI'll update my plan file today with the [long] list of things we're addressing\nfor the point release (yes, we've fixed the scoreboard).\n\n12/16/99\n\nMac demo will be out tonight.  Mac full version is also complete.\n\n12/14/99\n\nChurn time.  We define \u00c2\u0093Churn\u00c2\u0094 as the number of unique people that authorize\nin a five-minute period.  At peak now we\u00c2\u0092re at around 1700 people in a five-minute\nperiod, and at off peak we\u00c2\u0092re at 500.  Peak is around 5pm-11pm and off-peak is\n8am until about noon.  As we get more international I expect this to level out.\n\nWe\u00c2\u0092ve been testing Q3A for Y2K compliance.  Here\u00c2\u0092s the results:\n\n1.\tPower failed due to Y2K glitch.\n\nQ3A does not run if the power has failed because of a Y2K glitch.  Multiple\nattempts to bring the computer on using a series of car batteries and two lines\nof tin Q3A boxes did bring the computer up for a second, but the resulting fire\nand damage to the building did not allow us to recommend this solution.  We\napologize to Rogue for using their office and cars to test this.\n\n2.\tComputer has crashed because of a Y2K glitch.\n\nQ3A does not run if the computer has failed.  Installation of a different OS could be\nthe recommended solution, but the Y2K glitch had caused the computer to unrepentantly\njump out the window in a vain attempt to continue crashing.  We apologize to Rogue for\nusing their computers to complete this test.\n\n3.\tThe world\u00c2\u0092s nuclear arsenal goes off because of a Y2K glitch.\n\nQ3A does not survive a nuclear war, although the authorize server will continue to run.\nActually, we were unable to test this.  We\u00c2\u0092re just guessing.  We really don\u00c2\u0092t want to test\nthis out, so we\u00c2\u0092ll just it as golden that we\u00c2\u0092d be in big trouble if this happened.\n\n4.\tThe Internet fails because of a Y2K glitch.\n\nQ3A continues to run single player just fine, however, multi-player over the Internet could\nnot startup due to a general TCP/IP error.  With Ebay failing because of this as well the\nentire US economy would freefall into the cold Atlantic Ocean allowing the alien race hiding\non the dark side of the moon to finally begin their insidious campaign of marketing 366 days\nuntil 2001 memorabilia.\n\n5.\tThe coffee machines around the world fail because of a Y2K glitch.\n\nThere is no possible worse scenario than this, the lack of Java in the world would seriously\nundermine the Sun and cause the Earth to plummet into the cold and freeze the entire planet.\nStarbucks would continue to thrive on selling everything else it produces and actually become\nmore profitable since there would be more throughput at the cash register, but since all the\ncustomers would be dead they would relocate to a parallel dimension that voted to keep the\ndate 1999 for \u00c2\u0093just a few more years\u00c2\u0094.\n\n6.\tJohn Carmack fails because of a Y2K glitch.\n\nWe have 200 John Carmack clones hidden at secure sites around a small Idaho potato\nfarm (potatoes are considered Y2K compliant by all except the French, who insist that potatoes\nwill spontaneously explode at 4:31am, 1-1-00 ).  Don\u00c2\u0092t worry.  We\u00c2\u0092ve covered this base.\n\n12/10/99\n\nOkay.  I\u00c2\u0092m now officially overloaded on email.\n\nWe\u00c2\u0092re looking to get the tools out there very soon for creating Q3A modifications.\nWe\u00c2\u0092ll probably do a point release on the product before we release anything, and\nwe\u00c2\u0092ve been busy writing (gosh) documentation for the editor, shaders, etc.  I\u00c2\u0092m\nreally looking forward to seeing what you guys do with Q3A!\n\nWe\u00c2\u0092re now cracking down on people using key generators.  We stop accepting input\nfor a period of time from addresses that spam different keys to the authentication\nserver.  I see a lot of people running key generators right now; I\u00c2\u0092ve yet to see a single\none make a correct key.\n\nWe will also probably alter the key generation scheme on subsequent runs of the\nproduct so we can verify mistyped keys within the client.  This remains our biggest\nissue and if we can cure it right at the input step, then we\u00c2\u0092ll go a long way towards\neasing this up.\n\n12/08/99\n\nCracked servers are no longer listed through the master.  We're tracking these servers.  We\nknow your IP address, so if you have one running, I strongly suggest you take it down immediately.\n\n12/06/99\n\nOkay.  First off, don't run crack executables on your client!  All it's likely to do is grab\nyour CD key and send it off somewhere.  Authorization is server side, not client side.  We will\npursue and close down cracked servers with all available resources.\n\nSecondly, CD keys are \"leased\", so if you log on through a dialup, play, then disconnect your\nmodem and log right back on, your CD key will have to timeout on your previous IP before you\ncan play again.  This timeout period is currently set at 5 minutes.\n\n12/06/99\n\nOkay.  Hacker attempts with invalid keys are outnumbering real keys by a factor of 2:1 or so.\n\nObviously this is somewhat validating the use of CD keys.\n\nSo far I've seen issues with the servers being able to see the auth server and clients using\nIP forwarding not having the correct setup on the IP forwarding server.  If it's a Linux IP\nforwarding machine use something like:\n\nmodprobe ip_masq_quake ports=26000,27000,27910,27960,27950,27951,27952\n\nModulating characters within a key sequence will not work.  It appears to work because when\nyou've validated your IP with an authentic CD key you've \"leased\" that IP address for a period\nof time.  Even if you enter a junk string, that will work because your IP address is still valid.\n\nThe actual algorithm is a 64 bit DES key encryption method open to a very small window.  The\nchances of coming up with a real valid key is in the range of billions and billions to one.  A random\npass through the available keys shows no sign of repeating sequences, it looks like good old chaos\n(in fact, statisical math proves this).\n\nThe client has no idea if your key is really valid or not, it just checks on the correct characters\nbeing entered.  \n\n12/03/99\n\nWhy do I get booted back to the main menu?\n\nIt's because you've got a 1.11 client and you're trying to join a 1.09 (demo test) pure server.\nSince the protocol # is exactly the same, you see all the 1.09 servers in the browser,\nbut when you try and join the game you get booted because you aren't \"pure\".\n\nWe'll switch off support for 1.09 listings in the browser once 1.11 demo is out for the\nMac and Linux.  Meanwhile there's not much I can do since I can't tell from the client\nside if you're a 1.09 or 1.11 client asking for list of available servers.\n\n12/03/99\n\nIMPORTANT!!!!!\n\nYou MUST enter your CD key in lower case letters.  If you do this through the menu\nit's automatic, but if you set it from the console, upper case letters will not work.\n\nIMPORTANT!!!!!\n\n12/03/99\n\nIf you get a CD Key error, please check to make sure you have the CD Key correctly\nentered.  I've seen a few people go by and be denied on what looks like a valid key\nthat's just been typed in wrong.\n\n12/03/99\n\nThe demo has gone final and will be available through Sandpiper in a few hours.\n\nI've gotten a lot of feedback from people regarding the use of authentication servers. \nYes, John Carmack has a nice car from his hard work, but unfortunately software piracy\nhas become such a serious issue that we need to use schemes such as CD keys to protect\nour future sales.  Games cost large sums of money to make and market, and if you want to\nhave software developers continue to develop games then piracy, understanding it, and\naddressing it, needs to be part of the development process.\n\nDigital satellite receivers each ship with a little crypto card to uniquely number the\nmachine \u00c2\u0096 Dish Network and DirecTV make sure they get their money every month!  DVD\nencryption swayed Hollywood to produce high quality digital content that we as nerds\nlavished our money on, piracy of DVDs has not been an issue because of such encryption,\nbut now this has been broken and may affect the future of DVD, already it\u00c2\u0092s reported that\nDVD Audio has been delayed.  When Intel introduced a software accessible serial number\nwith the Pentium III it was quickly disabled because of public backlash, yet it\u00c2\u0092s very function\nwas to protect against piracy and allow security.\n\nSo with computers we\u00c2\u0092re stuck with freedom, which isn\u00c2\u0092t all that bad.  How many of us (Linux\ncrowd hush please) run 100% piracy free machines?  Does occasional use count?  If I only\nused it once to repartition my drive do I have to pay for Partition Magic?  Isn\u00c2\u0092t Winzip part\nof Microsoft?  We\u00c2\u0092re hypocrites if we cheer the Government ruling against Microsoft for including\nso much software free in their OS that we otherwise would use and never pay for.  Then again,\nI love Java, Macs and OpenGL.  There are corporations out there who work hard to make sure\nI\u00c2\u0092m a minority.\n\nIs piracy of id products the only way the community has prospered, grown and sustained itself\nall these years?  It\u00c2\u0092s true a certain number of you will always pirate a game and never make the\npurchase.  But a whole bunch of you are raving, fanatical loyal id fans with money in one hand\nand EB on speed dial in the other to see if Q3A is in stock.  If you help the community by helping\nto stamp out piracy, then I think you\u00c2\u0092ll see that the community will be just fine and who knows,\nsoftware prices might fall, Doom 2000 might come out, or the Y2K bug may not burn us all.\n\nSo yes.  Use a SOCKS server (we will authenticate multiple CD Keys off a single IP), open up those\nports on your firewall (you can resolve master.quake3arena.com and just use that IP address),\nbut please don\u00c2\u0092t belie our intentions.

The menu system stuffs vmsg commands to \nperform its work.\n- Fixed it so that a player is only killed when switching teams, not \nto/from spectator mode.\n- CTF team spawn points are in, team_CTF_redplayer and team_CTF_blueplayer.  \nThey are only used at game start, subsequent spawns are in deathmatch \nstarts.  Plans to have team only bits on dm starts as well?\n- Added two new system functions, Sys_DefaultCDPath() and \nSys_DefaultBasePath().  These establish the default base and cd path \ndirectories.  Under Windows, they are both set to current dir by default.  \nIn Unix, they are set to argv[0]'s path and $HOME/.q3a/ \nrespectively.  This allows storing the q3config.cfg in $HOME/.q3a/baseq3 \nunder Unix for per-user execution and settings.\n- If a double signal fault occurs in Linux, exit immediately.\n- stubs for Linux SMP.  \n- Reworked the Linux sound drivers based on recommendations by the 4Front \nguys.  Added support for 48KHz output and reorganized the sound driver \nsetup and initialization sequence.\n- added NET_Sleep(msec) call in server code to allow proper CPU throttling.  \nWakes up on packet or stdin under Unix.\n\n/// Zoid.\n"}, {"by": "zoid@idsoftware.com", "time": 951536520, "contents": "Welcome to id Software's Finger Service V1.5!\n\nName: Dave Kirsch\nEmail: zoid@idsoftware.com\nDescription: Ports\nProject: \nLast Updated: 02/25/2000 23:17:23 (Central Standard Time)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFeb 25th/2000\n\nIn September of 1996, I made a small modification to the popular id Software \ngame Quake and called it ThreeWave Capture the Flag.

I have decided that in order to pursue them, \nI must leave my association with id Software.  Having done so, I plan \non exploring new opportunities.\n\nMy contract with id terminates at the end of this month (Feb).  My \nzoid@idsoftware.com address will probably stop forwarding to my permanent\naddress shortly after that.  My permanent address is \nzoid@threewave.com \nfor people that wish to reach me.\n\nI would like to thank id Software (and especially John Carmack) for giving \nme such great opportunities, and allowing me to work with all the talented\npeople there.  I am going to miss it.\n\nIn March, I will begin a new position at Retro Studios, \nhttp://www.retrostudios.com/.  \nI look forward to joining the team there and working on some exciting new \nprojects.\n\nSo long and thanks for all the captures.\n\n/// Zoid.\n"}, {"by": "zor@ritual.com", "time": 934815720, "contents": "\n*** Ritual Entertainment's Finger Server\n\nUser name: zor\nPlan modified: Mon Aug 16 11:58:33 1999\n\n-- August 16th, 1999 -- \n- 11:50am CST -\nAs you may have noticed in the 1.06 patch, that I decided to\nrelease \"Brain Pain\", or spool.bsp.
