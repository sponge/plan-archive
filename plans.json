I\nfirst want to thank John Romero for the great compliments he has given us\non Quake 2. It really means a lot to me.  John has always been my design\nhero in a way. When I first got to id I shared an office with John and\ntried my hardest to design like him. The style and design techniques that\nyou see in Quake 2 were heavily influenced by the things I learned from\nhim.  There are two things I want to clarify from his .plan update.  The\nfirst one is that Paul Jaquays was the designer on the base secret level\n\"train\", not Brandon.  That was Paul's first real level he built for Quake\n2 and as a first time level it's simply amazing with its vertical scale\nand complexity.  Second, I would also like to add that Brandon did a ton\nof clean-up and monster placement work for the Waste unit and the Mine\nunit.  At id no one person does all the work on any given map.  Because\nthe design of Quake 2 was so large and complex a team effort was needed to\nget everything finished. When you look at a list of names and maps you\ncan't really understand everything that went into creating them. For\nexample, the \"security\" map was originally started by me, it was later\npassed on to Christian to finish. After I realized that I needed to add a\nconnection to \"mintro\" from it, I took it back to add an end.  When I was\ndone with that it returned to Christian to add a basement area. Then the\nlast day before we shipped I changed the top area again. As you can see I\nbuilt its foundation, but Christian also added a ton of stuff to it.\n\"Security\" isn't the only map with such a long history - power1, mintro,\nhangar1 (especially), and hangar2 all have similar stories. The list of\nmaps and names in Romero's .plan reflects the person who built the level's\nfoundation but does not reflect all the clean-up and tweaking done by the\nothers. If anyone has a question about a map feel free to ask any\ndesigner, chances are they did some work on it and can answer your\nquestion.\n\nI want to publicly thank and congratulate all the designers here that\nworked so hard to make such an awesome game. No one person could have done\nwhat the team did. We have become so strong as a team and I believe we\nwork so wonderfully together that I can not wait until we get started on\nthe mission pack.\n\n-Tim\n\n"}, {"by": "jcash@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-01-06", "contents": "[idsoftware.com]\nLogin name: jcash     \t\t\tIn real life: John Cash\nDirectory: /raid/nardo/jcash        \tShell: /bin/csh\nLast login Wed Jan  1 21:53 on ttyp3 from idtokay\nPlan:\nQuakeWorld Capture The Flag\n---------------------------\n  yep, I jumped in and squashed the grappling hook\n  bug.

Does anyone care?  Maybe not... but\nhere's a few SWAGs for the new year:\n\n1) Network Computer:\n\t(aka Web TV)\n\tthey'll flop again and again until people learn.\n\tJust like diskless workstations... they're a really\n\tgood idea... for somebody else - *I* need a real\n\tmachine.\n\n2) DVD:\n\t(whaveter the hell it stands for these days)\n\tit will be a success... eventually.  They've\n\tbotched any chance of a \"take the world by\n\tstorm\" launch with all the public squabbling,\n\tbut it's good technology and will make it\n\tdespite them.\n\n3) Cable modems:\n\tflop.  Cable companies can't even keep\n\ta unidirectional broadcast up reliably;\n\twho expects them to do better with point\n\tto point bidirectional data?  not me; I\n\tlove my DSS!\n\n4) 56kbps modems:\n\t(or whatever the next step is after the 33.6kbps is)\n\tthey'll have the usual initial compatability problems\n\tand lack of ISP support, but they'll do great.  What\n\tis there to compete?  Everything else either costs\n\ta lot more or just isn't going to work that well.\n\n5) The Internet\n\tNo, there isn't going to be a \"crash to end all crashes\".\n\tWill there be outages? yes.  Will there be slowdowns?\n\tyes.  BUT... problems will be fixed and capacity increased\n\tbecause Corporate America (aka them, aka the guys with\n\tall the money) need it to keep working now.\n\nThere ya go.  PLEASE don't flood me with email about this.\nAgree or disagree to your heart's content, but I'm not trying\nto start anything here.  Just felt like taking a few pot\nshots at the near future.\n\n--------------------\nJohn Cash\njcash@idsoftware.com\n"}, {"by": "jcash@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-03-02", "contents": "[idsoftware.com]\nLogin name: jcash     \t\t\tIn real life: John Cash\nDirectory: /raid/nardo/jcash        \tShell: /bin/csh\nLast login Sat Mar  1 17:38 on ttyp3 from idtokay\nPlan:\nThe insurance company finally figured out my car was\ntotalled (the guys at the shop knew it after about\n5 minutes).

If you need to make a linked\nlist, make your own link field.  chain gets written by\nsome of the builtin functions (like findradius) so your\nlist can get screwed.\n\nIf you don't want an entity to touch things anymore, don't\nchange it's .touch to SUB_Null.  Instead change it's .solid\nto SOLID_NOT.  Both ways work, but having the the entity\nstill solid means that the engine must still go through all\nthe steps of detecting collisions and calling the null\nfunction (IOW, it's slower).\n\nIf an entity does not need to think then just do not update\nit's nextthink field.  Having a think function that really\ndoesn't do anything is bad for the same reasons as the touch\nfunction in the previous tip.\n\nDo not have an entity think more often than is necessary.\nThis is mainly to keep your prgs net friendly.  Let's say\nyou have an entity that thinks every 0.05 seconds (20\ntimes per sec, the default max rate for a dedicated server).\nYes, you could do some really cool stuff.  The problem is\nthat you are potentially causing that entity to be updated\nin every single message from the client to the server; it\ndepends on what you do in the think, but it quite likely.\nRemember: The bigger the messages, the more likely it is\nthe clients will see lag.\n\n\nw00p list\n---------\nM3's (red or black)\nGirl Scout cookies (Samoas)\n\nllama list\n----------\nanybody who uses a client side bot\n\t(without making it *REALLY* obvious it's a bot)\n\n--------------------\n\nJohn Cash\n\njcash@idsoftware.com\n\n"}, {"by": "jcash@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-01-14", "contents": "[idsoftware.com]\nLogin name: jcash                       In real life: John Cash\nDirectory: /raid/nardo/jcash            Shell: /bin/csh\nLast login Mon Jan 13 12:09 on ttyp6 from idtokay\nPlan:\nWell, we did it.

So here it is. [drumroll]\n\nThe Cash Diet Plan\n==================\nWhat to eat:\n        Red meat\n                Lots of it.  Cooked rare or medium rare.\n                Burgers, steaks, meatballs.. whatever.\n                No steak sauce, but gravy or juice is good.\n        Fried stuff:\n                Mainly potato chips and french fries.\n                Not those lame baked ones; real ones with\n                salt and oil and fat (and flavor) and maybe\n                bbq, vinegar, or something hot/spicy.\n        Dessert\n                Good stuff, not that low fat/low calorie crap.\n                Whipped cream is a definite plus.  Important\n                note: you are not restricted to only one.\n                Feel free to start out with a dessert as a\n                pre-appetizer appetizer.\n        Appetizers\n                Loaded nachos, Buffalo wings, Onion rings.\n\nWhat to drink:\n        Non-diet soft drinks (preferably with high\n                levels of caffeine)\n        Real beer\n\nSnacks:\n        Yes, of course.  Anytime you want.  I find\n        a snack to be good right before or right\n        after exercising.  Contrary to what you might\n        be thinking, fruit is actually OK as a snack...\n        as long as you \"wash it down\" with a candy bar.\n\nExercise:\n        Hey, what kind of diet doesn't include exercise?\n        This is the key to my diet.  There is only one\n        exercise that is aerobic, burns lots of calories,\n        and you'll actually enjoy doing.  As an added\n        bonus it can be singles, couples, or even teams.\n        I'm talking, of course, about good old fashioned\n        sex.  The more the better (but take it easy when\n        working out alone!)  BTW, here's where that\n        whipped cream on the desserts can come in handy.\n\nThere you have it.  I think it'll catch on.. I mean,\nwhat is there not to like?\n\nSo, I hear you thinking: sounds great, but does it\nreally work?  Well, it does for me.  I'm 5'10\" and\nweigh 125 pounds.  I eat what I want, when I want,\nand \"work out\" as often as possible (w00p!!!)\n\nWarning: There is one possible side effect of this\ndiet...   ummm... I have two of 'em... both boys\nSo practice safe dieting.\n\n\n\nQuakeC Tips\n-----------\nDon't use the chain field.

Both ways work, but having the the entity\nstill solid means that the engine must still go through all\nthe steps of detecting collisions and calling the null\nfunction (IOW, it's slower).\n\nIf an entity does not need to think then just do not update\nit's nextthink field.  Having a think function that really\ndoesn't do anything is bad for the same reasons as the touch\nfunction in the previous tip.\n\nDo not have an entity think more often than is necessary.\nThis is mainly to keep your prgs net friendly.  Let's say\nyou have an entity that thinks every 0.05 seconds (20\ntimes per sec, the default max rate for a dedicated server).\nYes, you could do some really cool stuff.  The problem is\nthat you are potentially causing that entity to be updated\nin every single message from the client to the server; it\ndepends on what you do in the think, but it quite likely.\nRemember: The bigger the messages, the more likely it is\nthe clients will see lag.\n\n\nw00p list\n---------\nThe Cash diet plan\nFemale Quake players\nGirl Scout cookies\n        Samoas are the best.  Sorry, news dudes.\n        Thin Mints (and the peanut butter ones)\n        are good too, but Samoas rule.  They\n        give you more reason to \"diet\" ;-)\n\nllama list\n----------\na minor bot rant:\n        complete bots are cool.  I mean bots that\n        try to play entirely by themselves with\n        absolutely no human input (Reaper style).\n\n        augmentation bots (aka proxy bots, like\n        the stooge bot) are NOT.  I am sick and\n        tired of lamers using these things and\n        trying to lie and saying they are not.\n        Those fools are giving llamas a bad name.\n\n--------------------\n\nJohn Cash\n\njcash@idsoftware.com\n\n"}, {"by": "jcash@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-07-09", "contents": "[idsoftware.com]\nLogin name: jcash     \t\t\tIn real life: John Cash\nDirectory: /raid/nardo/jcash        \tShell: /bin/csh\nLast login Mon Jul  8 11:30 on ttyp6 from iddrakken\nPlan:\n>>> Quake <<<\nWhen in Mesquite... do a work log!\n\n6/13:\n*not all players get score at end of deathmatch\n*connect while demo is running fails\n*connect/disconnect/connect again fails\n*Kevin's \"beat on the keyboard while it's initializing\" page fault\n*report error if ipx open socket fails\n*default strings for modems\n*work with John on network menus\n*make sure we have enough ipx sockets\n*ipx error 0xfc (request cancelled) on send starting a new server\n*make dropped datagram message developer mode only\n\nverify version checks are correct\namerican's win95 tcp/ip problem\none guy has to use -noudp or it \"won't run\"\n\n\n6/14:\n*internet play testing\n*play qtest1 under an assumed name for comparison\n*work with John on network menus (continued)\n*mike's machine at home didn't find cd audio tracks\n*system cvars will only report changes when they really do\n*modem play testing\n\nWin95 with dial-up networking only sometimes crashes unless -noipx???\n\n\n6/15:\n*direct connect serial play\n*work with John on network menus (continued)\n*reliable message stream shutting down during internet play\n*move ftp site to new location\n*save our local network address(es) so we can show them\n*remove some duplicate code in the Win95 TCP/IP code\n*drop stale datagrams\n\n\n6/16:\n*move www site to new location\n*make IPX send errors non-fatal\n*work on network menus\n\n\n6/17:\n*don't allow choosing save on menu if not in a game\n*make sure there's always room for 4 players so we can change from\n\tsingle player to a listen server on the fly\n*write cd-rom readme file\n*check for Win95 giving back an text form IP address for the hostname\n*add hostname to config menu\n*deathmatch not set correctly from menu\n\n\n6/18:\n*fix FPCW problem under Nextstep that's causing cvars to get set incorrectly\n*add my 2 cents to the Win95 readme\n*don't show local game on search for games menu\n*update network readme file and add Win95 specifics\n*can't set max players when a game's already running\n*make player's name and colors saved cvars\n*change so if CD doesn't restart track on same track play request\n*serial setup menu\n*don't allow saves at intermission, if no server, or in a deathmatch\n*only list shareware levels on menu for shareware\n\n\n6/19:\n*read over all the readmes and look for stuff\n*review code\n*don't allow server's with no name\n*fix player name > 15 characters crash\n*fixed IPX checking AX instead of AL in receive error path\n*get the old ftp machine back online under it's new name\n\n\n6/20:\n*modem init string saved but not restored\n*change to always require selection of com port - safer this way\n*low-level recoverable serial messages flagged as developer\n*connect Satan to his new UPS\n*friendly fire\n\n\n6/21..6/23:\n*forget to update .plan file\n\n\n6/24:\n*Typing long hostname or modem init field in the menus caused\ncrashes\n*Under Win95 IPX can be detected but not functional, resulting in sys_error\n*If -nosound, got \"S_LocalSound: can't cache\" on every keypress in the menu\n*reliable message stream\ngetsstopped up, resulting in frag counts and talk\n\tmessages no longer\nbeing delivered, but game movement continues\n*The menu com port settings were getting saved & restored but not used\n*Direct serial connections did not work with slist\n*qlaunch.exe freqeuntly failed to execute on the first attempt\n*quakeudp.dll\nwas running out of buffers when running a server\n\n\n6/25:\n*team colors did not operate as documented\n*changelevel from client crashed\n*don't print name changes when they didn't really change\n\n\n6/26:\n*modem init didn't get done from menu\n*serial reliable stream was getting stalled\n*changelevel while demos running crashed\n*changelevel with no map left up loading screen\n*too long names could be entered from the console\n\ntimelimit and fraglimit work in single player\n\n\n6/27:\n*waste time screwing around with lame ass hackers\n*work on menus\n*test & research serial problems\n\n\n6/28:\n*waste MORE time screwing around with lame ass hackers\n*work on menus\n*test & research serial problems\n\n\n6/29:\n*work on menus\n*work on serial code cleanup\n\n7/1:\n*work on menus (can you say \"total rewrite\"?)\n\n\n7/2:\n*menus, menus, menus\n\n\n7/3:\n*finsihed the menus;

He joins Zoid as a (part time) contractor for us.\n\nA modified version of Radiant will be the level editor for Quake 3. The primary changes will be support for curved surfaces and more general surface shaders. All changes will be publicly released, either after Q3 ships or possibly at the release of Q3Test, depending on how things are going.\n\nThe other major effort is to get Radiant working properly on all of the 3D cards that are fielding full OpenGL ICDs. If you want to do level development, you should probably get an 8mb video card. Permedia II cards have been the mainstay for developers that can't afford intergraph systems, but 8mb rendition v2200 (thriller 3D) cards are probably a better bet as soon as their ICD gets all the bugs worked out."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-05-22", "contents": "The SMP support is solid enough to play with now. The only feature that is still broken is light flares.\n\nAs a happy consequence, some of the cleanup work I did for SMP gave a couple percent speedup even when running without the separate thread.\n\nOn my development system, a dual 300 mhz intergraph realizm II, the low res timedemo scores went from 27.8 to 37.8 with \"r_smp 1\". This is only a 35% average speedup, but at some times (lots of dynamic lights in complex scenes) the speedup is 90%+. Gameplay is noticably smoother.\n\nThe rendering thread is almost always the blocking factor, so the faster the card and OpenGL driver, the larger the speedup will be.\n\nThis is explicitly a two thread producer / consumer, so there is no benefit to more than two processors. The app is well behaved, using sleeping syncronization so that you usually still have half a processor free for other operating system functions.\n\nHopefully we will be able to test with some fast consumer cards sometime soon.\n\n------\n\nA lot of people asked what was done differently this time vs the last time I tried (without benefit) to use SMP.\n\nMy original attempt was to make a DLL that intercepted all OpenGL calls and let a separate processor execute them. The benefit would have been that all OpenGL applications could have gone faster. The problem was that the bandwidth required to encode all the commands was enough that the processor overhead was as much as it would have taken to just do the geometry on the main processor.\n\nIt would have still been a win if the geometry side was doing lots of work, like multiple lights, user clip planes, and texgens, but for the vast majority of geometry, it didn't balance out. If someone wanted to try that using the PIII or AltiVec streaming memory operations, it could probably still work.\n\nThe current SMP code is implemented directly into the renderer, and a lot of things were moved around and double buffered to allow it to use data in place, instead of having to copy it off.\n\n------\n\nSome people expressed surprise that Quake3 wasn't threaded already.\n\nThreading has been presented so often as the \"high tech\" \"cool\" way to program, that many people aren't aware of the downsides.\n\nA multi-threaded program will always have somewhat lower throughput when running on a single CPU than a single threaded program that polls in explicit places. The cost of a context switch at the cpu level is negligible, but the damage that it can do to the cache hierarchy can add up to a noticeable amount in bad cases.\n\nThe much larger problem is that you lose tight control over when things occur. If the framerates are low enough, it isn't a huge issue, but for applications running at 30+ fps, you really don't want to trust the OS scheduler to coordinate multiple threads and have them all get in every frame. Yes, with explicit sleep() calls you can sort of get it working, but at that point, you might as well not be using threads.\n\nA good example of not-quite-in-sync issues in the windows mouse performance. A PS/2 mouse only samples 40 times a second, so when you get an app updating at around that speed, you will get 0/1/2 scheduling variances.\n\nThey are also not terribly portable, and a pain in the ass to debug."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-12-31", "contents": "** Dec 31: 4:40 AM: **\n\nA user just reported having their net quake problems go away when they killed ICQ. I suppose it has never been stated directly, so here goes:\n\nQuake needs all the bandwidth that a modem connection provides to play well. Any other program accessing the internet is going to cause a degredation in gameplay, sometimes severe.\n\nSo quit IRC, ICQ, email, and web browsers before setting out for serious net play unless you have ISDN or better.\n\n\n** Dec 31: 12:41 PM CST: **\n\nI just spent a few hours working with a quake player that still couldn't net quake with 3.09.\n\nIt took a while, but I finally understand what is going on.\n\nHe could play net games on his local lan, but when he tried to connect to remote servers, it would always fail and timeout midway through the connection process, or at most a few seconds into the game.\n\nThe situation was that there was a small network of computers connected to an ISDN router that did address translation.\n\nAddress translation allows multiple computers to use the internet through a single TCP/IP address. This is accomplished by having the router perform some \"invisible\" port and ip renaming on everything that goes out.\n\nI think that is a rather evil thing for a router to do, but I suppose I can see the incentive from an address pressure viewpoint.\n\nRouters know when TCP streams begin and end, so they make sure the port mappings stay constant through the entire thing, but quake uses UDP packets (anyone who suggests using TCP for a realtime game does not understand how the error recovery works), and the router apears to be making the incorrect assumption that UDP is only used for simple request / response protocols.\n\nThe router changes the UDP port while you are playing.\n\nGrrrr.\n\nNow, a smarter router would only change the port numbers when it was actually forced to by a collision, which would only be when a connection was first opened, and everything would work out ok.\n\nAfter I understood what was happening, I could devise a fix for it. My simple fix was to make the server simply ignore the port number for client comparisons, and assume that if a packet came from the same IP address, then it is the same player even if the port number changed. That worked, and he was able to connect in to my modified server.\n\nThat has the distinct drawback of making translating routers or proxies that do the port mapping correctly unusable by more than one player at a time.\n\nI could fix it completely by including a sort of port number in each message, and having the servers match and update UDP ports based on that. That would work fine, but at the cost of adding a byte or two to everyone's packets to help out people with bad routers. You wouldn't be able to tell a difference, but its the principle of it...\n\nI could make a server side cvar to force port fixing on, but that would still not work for one class of users or the other.\n\nI could make it client settable and have the client tell the server on connect that it needs port fixing. That would work with no bandwidth cost to anyone, but it would require users to know that if they can't connect to servers, then they should try to use the fix translation option. Unfortunately, I bet that there are some routers that exhibit this problem much less often. A drop every ten minutes would be hard to attribute.\n\nI could make port fixing on by default, but if anyone is on a translated lan and another person tries to start a net quake game to the same server then they will both collide and crash and burn.\n\nI am probably going to add the extra bytes to every packet. Being automatically robust on more people's systems is probably worth a microscopic loss of bandwidth. Two bytes is under one millisecond of ping on a modem.\n\nIf there is some magic range of port values that I can use to make these routers act better, let me know.\n\nThese changes will break the connection protocol again, so I am going to hold off on the patch for a while."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-12-25", "contents": "We are going to release a new quake 2 executable that fixes the malicious server crashing problems Real Soon Now.

Because the developers (me included) are basically just doing the work in their spare time, testing usually only consists of running their favorite OpenGL application, and a few of the mesa demos, or some of the xscreensaver hacks.\n\nRecently I did the initial bringup of a RagePro driver on linux, and I was much more conscious of the large untested feature space, and the tunnel vision I was using to get it to the point of running Q3.\n\nWhat we need is someone, or a group of someones, who can really exercise different implementations through all corners of the OpenGL specification and provide detailed lists of faults with minimal test cases to reproduce the behavior.\n\nIn most cases, the bugs could then be fixed, but even if it is decided that the incorrect behavior is going to stay (to avoid a software fallback in a common accelerated case), there would be clear documentation of it.\n\nI consider performance on the matrox driver right now to be \"good enough\". There is definately more performance oriented work going on, but given a choice of tasks to work on, I would rather improve quality and coverage instead of kicking a few more fps out of Q3.\n\nOne of Alex St. John's valid points was that \"The drivers are always broken\". There are a lot of factors that contribute to it, including fierce benchmarking competition causing driver writers to do some debatable things and diminish focus on quality. With open source drivers, some of those factors go away. Sure, it is nice to beat windows drivers on some benchmarks, but I wouldn't let pursuit of that goal introduce dumb things into the code.\n\nSome of the windows IHVs have good testing proceedures and high quality drivers, but even there, it would be nice to have someone hounding them about things beyond how well quake releated games run.\n\nThe same goes for Apple, especially now that there is both ATI and 3dfx support.\n\nConformance would be my primary interest, but characterizing the performance of different drivers would also be usefull, especially for edge cases that may or may not be accelerated, like glDrawPixels.\n\nOn linux right now, we have:\n\nThe traditional fullscreen 3dfx mesa driver \nThe DRI-GLX based banshee/voodoo3 driver \nThe utah-GLX matrox G200/G400 driver \nThe temporary utah-GLX nvidia driver \nThe newly born utah-GLX ATI Rage Pro driver\n\nIf anyone is interested, join the developer list off of: http://glx.on.openprojects.net/\n\nDoing a proper job would require a really good knowledge of the OpenGL specification, and a meticulous style, but it wouldn't require hardcore registers-and-dma driver writing skills, only basic glut programming.\n\nIf someone does wind up developing a good suite of tools and procedures and gives one of the drivers a really good set of feedback, I would be happy to provide extra video cards so they could beat up all the implementations."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-03-17", "contents": "* triggered trains\n* began work on sound code\n\n+ edge friction jumping\n+ edge friction in air?\n\nambush guards\ntemp ent precache\ndoes pacifier not work on net games?"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-03-03", "contents": "* added precache_file qcc option for -copy files\n* capped health at 250\n\n+ solid, invisible brushes\n+ don't send linear entities in signon message\n+ write a message trace printing mode\n+ is 256 angle quantization from client hurting us?\n+ sky animations use the wrong time base\n+ centralize the connection process\n\nweapon switching is wrong\nno twitch in god mode\nif a linear update entity doesn't get an update in a packet, remove it\nbound upper client message sends properly\nRELEASE: bump protocol version numbers just before releasing"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-10-17", "contents": "The next release will be the full \"demo\" release for quake 3.

Still, with agp texturing it is a solid platform with performance that is certainly good enough to play the game well on.\n\nExisting iMacs have 6mb ragePro video. ATI's windows drivers for the pro have come a long ways, and Q3 is plenty playbale on windows with a rage pro (ugly, but playable). On apple systems (iMacs and beige G3's), the performance is sometimes as low as HALF the windows platform. The lack of AGP contributes some to this, but it is mostly just a case of the drivers not being optimzed yet. The focus has been on the rage128 so far.\n\nThe iBook is also ragePro based, but it is an ultra-cheap 32 bit version. It does texture over AGP, but it is slooooow. I suspect it is still driver issues, because it is still very slow even at 320x240, so that leaves hope that it can be improved.\n\nAnother issue with the Apple systems is that Apple 16 bit color is actually 15 bit.

DoomRPG is selling better now than when it was initially released, and the numbers are promising for supporting additional development work. However, unless I am pleasantly surprised, the hardware capabilities are going to advance much faster than the market in the next couple years, leading to an unusual situation where you can only afford to develop fairly crude games on incredibly powerful hardware. Perhaps \"elegantly simple\" would be the better way of looking at it, but it will still wind up being like developing an Xbox title for $500,000. That will wind up being great for many small game companies that just want to explore an idea, but having resource far in excess of your demands does minimize the value of being a hot shot programmer. :-)\n\nTo some degree this is already the case on high end BREW phones today. I have a pretty clear idea what a maxed out software renderer would look like for that class of phones, and it wouldn't be the PlayStation-esq 3D graphics that seems to be the standard direction. When I was doing the graphics engine upgrades for BREW, I started along those lines, but after putting in a couple days at it I realized that I just couldn't afford to spend the time to finish the work. \"A clear vision\" doesn't mean I can necessarily implement it in a very small integral number of days. I wound up going with a less efficient and less flexible approach that was simple and robust enough to not likely need any more support from me after I handed it over (it didn't).\n\nDuring the development of DoomRPG, I had commented that it seemed obvious that it should be followed up with a \"traditional, Orcs&Elves sort of fantasy game\". A couple people independently commented that \"Orcs&Elves\" wasn't a bad name for a game so since we didn't run into any obstacles, Orcs& Elves it was. Naming new projects is a lot harder than most people think, because of trademark issues.\n\nIn hindsight, we made a strategic mistake at the start of O&E development. We were fresh off the high end BREW version of DoomRPG, and we all liked developing on BREW a lot better than Java. It isn't that BREW is inherently brilliant, it just avoids the deep sucking nature of java for resource constrained platforms (however, note the above about many mobile games not being resource constrained in the future), and allows you to work inside visual studio. O&E development was started high-end first with the low-end versions done afterwards. I should have known better (Anna was certainly suspicious), because it is always easier to add flashy features without introducing any negatives than it is to chop things out without damaging the core value of a game. The high end version is really wonderful, with all the graphics, sound, and gameplay we aimed for, but when we went to do the low end versions, we found that even after cutting the media as we planned, we were still a long way over the 280k java application limit. Rather than just butchering it, we went for pain, suffering, and schedule slippage, eventually delivering a game that still maintained high quality after the de-scoping (the low end platforms still represent the majority of the market). It would have been much easier to go the other way, but the high end phone users will be happy with our mistake.\n\nDoomRPG had three base platforms that were customized for different phones -- Java, low end BREW, and high end BREW. O&E added a high end java version that kept most of the quality of the high end BREW version on phones fast enough to support it from carriers willing to allow the larger download. The download size limits are probably the most significant restriction for gaming on the high end phones. I don't really understand why the carriers encourage streaming video traffic, but balk at a couple megs of game media.\n\nI am really looking forward to the response to Orcs&Elves, because I think it is one of the best product evolutions I have been involved in. The core game play mechanics that were laid out in DoomRPG have proven strong and versatile (again, I bet we have a stable genre here), but now we have a big bag of tricks and a year of polishing the experience behind us, along with a world of some depth. I found it a very good indicator that play testers almost always lost track of time while playing.\n\nThis project was doubly nostalgic for me -- the technology was over a decade old for me, but the content took me back twenty years. All the computer games I wrote in high school were adventure games, and my first two commercial sales were Ultima style games for the Apple II, but Id Software never got around to doing one. Old timers may recall that we were going to do a fantasy game called \"The Fight For Justice\" (starring a hero called Quake...) after Commander Keen, but Wolfenstein 3D and the birth of the FPS sort of got in the way. :-) "}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1998-03-21", "contents": "I just shut down the last of the NEXTSTEP systems running at id.\n\nWe hadn't really used them for much of anything in the past year, so it was just easier to turn them off than to continue to administer them.\n\nMost of the intel systems had already been converted to NT or 95, and Onethumb gets all of our old black NeXT hardware, but we have four nice HP 712/80 workstations that can't be used for much of anything.\n\nIf someone can put these systems to good use (a dallas area unix hacker), you can have them for free.

A modern high-end game is a really breathtaking consumer of computation and storage resources for anyone that has been around computers for any length of time. Our target platforms have at least 512 mb of ram, almost 20 gb of media storage, and many tens of gflops of computation, but the development environment involves an even more massive deployment, with a terabyte of raw data being generated before the final culling and compression is done. It is easy to be a little nonchalant about the continuous pace of improvement with computing, but I still take the time to feel a sense of awe about it all.\n\nI started programming on a Commodore VIC-20 with 4k of ram and a tape drive, and I remember writing absurdly long lines of basic code to save the couple bytes that a new line number would consume. As the years went by, and my projects moved from the Apple II to the PC and the early consoles, I continued to gain new insights and perspective on different problems, and I often thought that it would be fun to go back to one of the early small systems. Now that I \"knew what I was doing\", I could do a lot more within the tight constraints than I was ever able to before. I actually carried a bunch of old systems around with me from house to house for many years before I reached the conclusion that I never was going to spend any real time on them again, and finally tossed them out.\n\nAs technology continued to rapidly advance, I saw a lot of good programmers sort of peel off from high end game development, and migrate to other platforms where their existing skill sets were still exactly what was needed. There was a large contingent of hard core assembly language programmers that never wanted to \"get soft\" with the move to C for more complex game development, and many of them moved from PCs to platforms like the super Nintendo, and eventually into embedded systems or device firmware. There was another contingent that never wanted to move to windows, and so on.\n\nThere is an appeal to working with tighter constraints. The more limited the platform, the closer you can feel you are getting to an \"optimal\" solution. On a modern big system, there are dozens of ways to accomplish any given task, and it just isn't possible to evaluate all the tradeoffs between the implementations of hundreds of different tasks. On a little system, you have to constrain your design to have a much smaller total number of tasks, and the available options are a lot more reduced. Seeing if something is The Right Thing is a lot easier.\n\nI probably had my personal \"moment of truth\" around the beginning of Doom 3's development, when it became clear that it is no longer possible to deeply understand every single part of a modern application. There is just too much. Nevertheless, I found that I could still enjoy my work when confined to a subset of the entire project, and I have thus remained committed to the high end. However, the appeal of smaller systems still lingers.\n\nA couple years ago, almost on a whim, I got involved in developing games for mobile phones. The primary instigator was when I ran a bunch of games on a new phone and was left frankly appalled at how poor they were. I was thinking to myself \"I wrote better games than this each month before we founded Id\". I downloaded the SDK for the phone, and started tinkering around a bit. A proof of concept demo and a plan for a game play style specifically tailored for cell phones followed, and we wound up with DoomRPG, and later Orcs & Elves which turned out to be big hits.\n\nIn an ideal world, where I could either stop time or clone myself, I would act as a lead programmer for some smaller projects. In the real world, I can't justify spending much time away from the high-end work, so the low-end work gets done in a few short bursts of engine creation and foundation laying, which is then handed over to the Fountainhead team to actually build a great game. After that, Anna mostly uses me as a threat -- if her programmers tell her that something she really wants in a game can't be done, she threatens to call me up and have me tell them how straightforward the problem really is, which usually fuels them to figure out how to do it on their own.\n\nMobile development was fun in a resource constrained design sort of way, but the programming didn't have the \"tight\" feel that early gaming had, due to the huge variability in the platforms. When I was messing around on my own phone, I spent some time doing java bytecode disassembly and timing, but it was fairly pointless in light of the two hundred or so different phones the game would wind up running on.\n\nEnter the Nintendo DS.\n\n\nWe had initially looked at possibly moving one of the cell phone titles over to the GBA, but it didn't look like the market would support it, and technically it would have only turned out somewhere in between the low end and high end cell phone versions. With the success of DS, and a suspicion that the players might be a little more open to new third party titles, EA decided that they would support developing a really enhanced version of Orcs&Elves for the DS. This is going a bit out on a limb -- most successful Game Boy / DS titles have been either first-party Nintendo titles, or titles with a strong movie / toy / history tie in. While Orcs & Elves is doing well on mobile, it is still very far from a recognized brand.\n\nThe resource limits on the DS make it almost perfect for a small team development. The hardware is fun to work with, you can directly poke at all the registers, the tool chain works well, and the built in limitations of cartridge memory keeps the design decisions fairly straightforward. Going one step farther up to the PSP with a UMD brings you into the realm of large media sizes that can rapidly consume multi-million dollar development budgets.\n\nOnce the decision was made to go for it, it was my job to figure out what we could reasonably hope to accomplish on the platform, andbring up a first cut at the 3D rendering engine.\n\nUp next: all the technical details"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-07-07", "contents": "The quality of Quake's software has been a topic of some discussion lately. I avoid IRC like the plague, but I usually hear about the big issues.\n\nQuake has bugs. I freely acknowledge it, and I regret them. However, Quake 1 is no longer being actively developed, and any remaining bugs are unlikely to be fixed. We would still like to be aware of all the problems, so we can try to avoid them in Quake 2.\n\nAt last year's #quakecon, there was talk about setting up a bug list maintained by a member of the user community. That would have been great. Maybe it will happen for Quake 2.\n\nThe idea of some cover up or active deception regarding software quality is insulting.\n\nTo state my life .plan in a single sentance: \"I want to write the best software I can\". There isn't even a close second place. My judgement and my work are up for open criticism (I welcome insightfull commentary), but I do get offended when ulterior motives are implied.\n\nSome cynical people think that every activity must revolve around the mighty dollar, and anyone saying otherwise is just attempting to delude the public. I will probably never be able to convince them that isn't allways the case, but I do have the satisfaction of knowing that I live in a less dingy world than they do.\n\nI want bug free software. I also want software that runs at infinite speed, takes no bandwidth, is flexible enough to do anything, and was finished yesterday.\n\nEvery day I make decisions to let something stand and move on, rather than continuing until it is \"perfect\". Often, I really WANT to keep working on it, but other things have risen to the top of the priority que, and demand my attention.\n\n\"Good software\" is a complex metric of many, many dimensions. There are sweet spots of functionality, quality, efficiancy and timeliness that I aim for, but fundamentally YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING.\n\nA common thought is that if we just hired more programmers, we could make the product \"better\".\n\nIt's possible we aren't at our exactly optimal team size, but I'm pretty confidant we are close.\n\nFor any given project, there is some team size beyond which adding more people will actually cause things to take LONGER. This is due to loss of efficiency from chopping up problems, communication overhead, and just plain entropy. It's even easier to reduce quality by adding people.\n\nI contend that the max programming team size for Id is very small.\n\nFor instance, sometimes I need to make a change in the editor, the utilities, and the game all at once to get a new feature in. If we had the task split up among three seperate programmers, it would take FAR longer to go through a few new revs to debug a feature. As it is, I just go do it all myself. I originated all the code in every aspect of the project, so I have a global scope of knowledge that just wouldn't be possible with an army of programmers dicing up the problems. One global insight is worth a half dozen local ones.\n\nCash and Brian assist me quite a lot, but there is a definite, very small, limit to how many assistants are worthwhile. I think we are pretty close to optimal with the current team.\n\nIn the end, things will be done when the are done, and they should be pretty good. :)\n\nA related topic from recent experience:\n\nAnatomy of a mis-feature:\n----\n As anyone who has ever disected it knows, Quake's triangle model format is a mess. Any time during Quake's development that I had to go back and work with it, I allways walked over to Michael and said \"Ohmygod I hate our model format!'. I didn't have time to change it, though. After quake's release, I WANTED to change it, especially when I was doing glquake, but we were then the proud owners of a legacy data situation.\n\nThe principle reason for the mess is a feature.\n\nAutomatic animation is a feature that I trace all the way back to our side-scroller days, when we wanted simple ways to get tile graphics to automatically cycle through animations without having to programatically each object through its frames.\n\nI thought, \"Hmm. That should be a great feature for Quake, because it will allow more motion without any network bandwidth.\"\n\nSo, we added groups of frames and groups of skins, and a couple ways to control the timing and syncronization. It all works as designed, but parsing the file format and determining the current frames was gross.\n\nIn the end, we only used auto-frame-animation for torches, and we didn't use auto-skin-animation at all (Rogue did in mission pak 2, though).\n\nAh well, someone might use the feature for something, and its allready finished, so no harm done, right?\n\nWrong. There are a half dozen or so good features that are apropriate to add to the triangle models in a quake technology framework, but the couple times that I started doing the research for some of them, I allways balked at having to work with the existing model format.\n\nThe addition of a feature early on caused other (more important) features to not be developed.\n\nWell, we have a new model format for Quake 2 now. Its a ton simpler, manages more bits of precision, includes the gl data, and is easy to extend for a couple new features I am considering. It doesn't have auto-animation.\n\nThis seems like an easy case - almost anyone would ditch auto-animation for, say, mesh level of detail, or multi-part models. The important point is that the cost of adding a feature isn't just the time it takes to code it. The cost also includes the addition of an obsticle to future expansion.\n\nSure, any given feature list can be implemented, given enough coding time. But in addition to coming out late, you will usually wind up with a codebase that is so fragile that new ideas that should be dead-simple wind up taking longer and longer to work into the tangled existing web.\n\nThe trick is to pick the features that don't fight each other. The problem is that the feature that you pass on will allways be SOMEONE's pet feature, and they will think you are cruel and uncaring, and say nasty things about you.\n\nSigh.\n\nSometimes the decisions are REALLY hard, like making head to head modem play suffer to enable persistant internet servers."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-09-16", "contents": "* finished box sweeping code\n* fix the automenu key problem on bad cinematic\n* blinking black screen palette set issues\n* send dowarp over from server\n* fixed color 0 grabbing\n* bonus flashes\n* Q_fabs\n\n+ dedicated server\n\ndrop stair climb in air height"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-09-02", "contents": "* serveronly semeaphor close check\n* error during initialization messagebox check\n* software rendering default wall image\n* unify slidestepmove\n\n+ progress bar\n+ roll angles are getting set on rotating models\n+ blinking lights on bonus items\n+ alpha test fix\n\nbug with loading a new map after an errored out map\nqe4: turn region off for new map\n\ngun should show vertical acceleration on lifts\nview angle turning based on impacts\nmuzzle flashes\ntrinity: fully compressed textures need to compress the mip levels as well, instead of generating them from the most detailed form.\ntrinity: different packing options to layout all the texture blocks.

I definately underestimated how big of a hole daily meetings would punch in the amount of work I could accomplish.\n\nOn wednesday I was sweating a bit, not sure if I would have the VM finished in time, but it all came together in the last two days.\n\nThe virtual machine interpreter is now completely functional, and cgame can switch between being loaded as a binary .dll or an interpreted .qvm at the change of a cvar.\n\nThe basic setup is that I have a modified version of the lcc compiler that generates assembly files that are processed by a new tool \"q3asm\" into a .qvm file that can be interpreted by q3. You can still use normal dll's for debugging, then release interpreted code. You can release a binary dll if you need some native system services (some networking stuff, for example) or are doing very compute intensive work, but I strongly encourage everyone to try to use the virtual machine.\n\nThe interpreted code has two prime benefits: portability and security.\n\nUser mods done with qvms will automatically work on mac, linux, and any other oddball ports that get released.\n\nA qvm program cannot modify anything outside its private address space, and the \"system calls\" to the game strictly limit what can be touched. I was scared about the binary dll's in Q2, but rationalized it to myself that people running public servers should be aware of the dangers. With Q3 allowing client side programming, it just needs to be safe for everyone.\n\nPackaging is also improved somewhat, because the virtual machine programs can be included in pak files and are automatically handled through the search path.\n\nUnfortunately, even after doing most of the straightforward optimizations, the interpreter is causing a 20% slowdown in timedemos right now.\n\nI am pretty committed to running cgame interpreted, but if I don't get a significant speedup, we may have to leave the server side game module as a native dll. The ui module can obviously be interpreted.\n\nThere are lots of paths I can take to get the performance up:\n\nWrite more efficient cgame code. I will definately be looking at this. A lot of things that just didn't matter at all when in native code now add up enough that they should be fixed. I want to avoid flexibility tradeoffs if possible.\n\nMove more calculation from the cgame to system calls. I have already done this for the obvious things like memset, matrixmultiply, etc. Any future work will involve restructuring cgame code to focus lots of work into simple stateless functions. The trick is to leave all the flexibility in the cgame while moving the work.\n\nImplement LCC compiler optimizations. I doubt I will pursue this, unless there are existing optimization projects based on LCC with minimal backend changes required.\n\nImplement more complex interpreted instructions and peephole combine the bytecodes into the new instructions. I think this has some promise.\n\nAssembly code the interpreter loop. The compiler is generating good code, but there is still room for gain. I don't want to pursue this until the high level optimizations are wrung out.\n\nLoad time compilation from bytecode to native code. This would bloat a lot, especially on RISC cpus. I'm not sure that a straightforward implementation would have significant speed benefits over an assembly interpreter loop, and I won't have time for writing an aggressive native optimizer.\n\nDeal with the performance cost and optimize the renderer some more to compensate."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "2003-02-07", "contents": "The machinima music video that Fountainhead Entertainment (my wife's company) produced with Quake based tools is available for viewing and voting on at: http://www.mtv.com/music/viewers_pick/ (\"In the waiting line\")\n\nI thought they did an excellent job of catering to the strengths of the medium, and not attempting to make a game engine compete (poorly) as a general purpose renderer.  In watching the video, I did beat myself up a bit over the visible popping artifacts on the environment mapping, which are a direct result of the normal vector quantization in the md3 format.  While it isn't the same issue (normals are full floating point already in Doom), it was the final factor that pushed me to do the per-pixel environment mapping for the new cards in the current engine.\n\nThe neat thing about the machinima aspect of the video is that they also have a little game you can play with the same media assets used to create the video.

If you keep the vertical fov constant and run on a wide screen, you get a 106 degree horizontal fov.\n\nBecause we specify fov with the horizontal measurement, you need to change fov when going into or out of a wide screen mode.

Every year or so I would install a linux distribution and play around with it for a few days, but I would always leave feeling that it was still pretty crude (UI wise) compared to the NEXTSTEP UI I was used to, or even what I had used on other commercial unix workstations and windows.\n\nThere have always been a ton of reasons to like linux, but the user interface was enough of an issue that I couldn't buy into it completely.\n\nThe gnome user environment in Red Hat 6.0 is finally at a level that I consider it a valid alternative to commercial desktop environments. Overall, its still not as smooth, consistant, or complete as windows or the mac, but is does have its strong points, and things seem to be progressing quite rapidly.\n\nIts still not something you would give to a purely casual computer user, but I won't be surprised if even that changes in a couple years.\n\nCodeWarrior for linux is also a significant aspect of my enjoyment. Its a sort of crappy 1.0 port with a lot of little issues, but the editor works well enough, which is the important thing for me.

It doesn't run them FAST, but the quality is good, and I am impressed nonetheless. It is bordering on playable with all quality options set to the minimum on a fast computer, but it still has a ways to go before casual users should take a look at it.\n\nIt is steadily improving, and I hope Matrox will be pleased enough with the progress that they will release the documentation for their setup engine to go with the rasterizer.\n\nIn testing q3 on it, I noticed that with picmip set to 0, textures would get corrupted and it would never settle on a working set. The current Apple OpenGL drivers also have exactly this problem.\n\nThe cool part is that this driver is completely open source. I downloaded the project code, browsed through it a bit, and changed two lines of code to fix the bug. That RULES.\n\nThe next thing is sort of funny. I had been suspecting that a lot of the OpenGL drivers were clearing the entire depth buffer for each of the 3D icons on the status bar, instead of limiting it to the scissor region. I added code to the g200 driver to explicitly crop the clear region in the driver, but it never got executed. A little more investigation showed that I had been making an improper assumption for years -- scissor is not enabled by default. Doh.\n\nEver since noticing that glquake cleared the screen borders when the view is sized down, I had been operating under the assumption that intergraph just had a bug in their drivers. I had double checked that glClear was supposed to be limited to the scissor region, so I thought they were just messing it up.\n\nNow I know that I was just being an idiot about that for the last three years...

There are many, many thousands of you out there, and there needs to be some filtering process so we can get the information efficiently.\n\nWe will read and evaluate everything that makes it through the discussion process.

Sometimes the great ideas are completely obvious when suggested, but were just missed. That is what I most hope to see.\n\nWhen the suggestions involve engineering tradeoffs and we have to consider the implementation effort of a feature vs its benefits, the best way to convince us to pursue it is to specify EXACTLY what benefits would be gained by undertaking the work, and specifying a clean interface to the feature from the file system data and the gamex86 code.\n\nWe hack where necessary, but I am much more willing to spend my time on an elegant extension that has multiple uses, rather than adding api bulk for specific features. Point out things that are clunky and inelegant in the current implementation. Even if it doesn't make any user visible difference, restructuring api for cleanliness is still a worthwhile goal.\n\nWe have our own ideas about game play features, so we may just disagree with you.

The DOOM source code is released for your non-profit use. You still need real DOOM data to work with this code. If you don't actually own a real copy of one of the DOOMs, you should still be able to find them at software stores.\n\nMany thanks to Bernd Kreimeier for taking the time to clean up the project and make sure that it actually works. Projects tends to rot if you leave it alone for a few years, and it takes effort for someone to deal with it again.\n\nThe bad news: this code only compiles and runs on linux. We couldn't release the dos code because of a copyrighted sound library we used (wow, was that a mistake - I write my own sound code now), and I honestly don't even know what happened to the port that microsoft did to windows.\n\nStill, the code is quite portable, and it should be straightforward to bring it up on just about any platform.\n\nI wrote this code a long, long time ago, and there are plenty of things that seem downright silly in retrospect (using polar coordinates for clipping comes to mind), but overall it should still be a usefull base to experiment and build on.\n\nThe basic rendering concept - horizontal and vertical lines of constant Z with fixed light shading per band was dead-on, but the implementation could be improved dramatically from the original code if it were revisited. The way the rendering proceded from walls to floors to sprites could be collapsed into a single front-to-back walk of the bsp tree to collect information, then draw all the contents of a subsector on the way back up the tree. It requires treating floors and ceilings as polygons, rather than just the gaps between walls, and it requires clipping sprite billboards into subsector fragments, but it would be The Right Thing.\n\nThe movement and line of sight checking against the lines is one of the bigger misses that I look back on. It is messy code that had some failure cases, and there was a vastly simpler (and faster) solution sitting in front of my face. I used the BSP tree for rendering things, but I didn't realize at the time that it could also be used for environment testing. Replacing the line of sight test with a bsp line clip would be pretty easy. Sweeping volumes for movement gets a bit tougher, and touches on many of the challenges faced in quake / quake2 with edge bevels on polyhedrons.\n\nSome project ideas:\n\nPort it to your favorite operating system.\n\nAdd some rendering features - transparency, look up / down, slopes, etc.\n\nAdd some game features - weapons, jumping, ducking, flying, etc.\n\nCreate a packet server based internet game.\n\nCreate a client / server based internet game.\n\nDo a 3D accelerated version. On modern hardware (fast pentium + 3DFX) you probably wouldn't even need to be clever - you could just draw the entire level and get reasonable speed. With a touch of effort, it should easily lock at 60 fps (well, there are some issues with DOOM's 35 hz timebase..). The biggest issues would probably be the non-power of two texture sizes and the walls composed of multiple textures.\n\nI don't have a real good guess at how many people are going to be playing with this, but if significant projects are undertaken, it would be cool to see a level of community cooperation. I know that most early projects are going to be rough hacks done in isolation, but I would be very pleased to see a coordinated 'net release of an improved, backwards compatable version of DOOM on multiple platforms next year.\n\nHave fun.\n\nJohn Carmack 12-23-97"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-03-05", "contents": "* basic zombie actions\n* added dog\n* fixed bug in QuakeEd

Userid filtering is the most convenient way  to keep a specific person off of a server, but because anyone can  create as many accounts as they want, a malicious user could just  keep logging back in with a new account.  If their ip address is  banned, they won't be able to log on with any account from that  computer.  Unfortunately, most dialup accounts give a different ip  address for each connection, so you may be forced to ban an entire  subnet to keep a specific person off.\n\nYou can add or remove addresses from the filter list with:\n\naddip <ip> removeip <ip>\n\nThe ip address is specified in dot format, and any unspecified  digits will match any value, so you can specify an entire class  C network with \"addip 192.246.40\".\n\nRemoveip will only remove an address specified exactly the same way.

The single player game will just be a progression through a ranking ladder against bot AIs. We think that can still be made an enjoyable game, but it is definately a gamble.\n\nIn the past, we have always been designing two games at once, the single player game and the multi player game, and they often had conflicting goals. For instance, the client-server communications channel discouraged massive quantities of moving entities that would have been interesting in single player, while the maps and weapons designed for single player were not ideal for multiplayer. The largest conflict was just raw development time. Time spent on monsters is time not spent on player movement. Time spent on unit goals is time not spent on game rules.\n\nThere are many wonderful gaming experiences in single player FPS, but we are choosing to leave them behind to give us a purity of focus that will let us make significant advances in the multiplayer experience.\n\nThe emphasis will be on making every aspect as robust and high quality as possible, rather than trying to add every conceivable option anyone could want. We will not be trying to take the place of every mod ever produced, but we hope to satisfy a large part of the network gaming audience with the out of box experience.\n\nThere is a definite effect on graphics technology decisions. Much of the positive feedback in a single player FPS is the presentation of rich visual scenes, which are often at the expense of framerate. A multiplayer level still needs to make a good first impression, but after you have seen it a hundred times, the speed of the game is more important. This means that there are many aggressive graphics technologies that I will not pursue because they are not apropriate to the type of game we are creating.\n\nThe graphics engine will still be OpenGL only, with significant new features not seen anywhere before, but it will also have fallback modes to render at roughly Quake-2 quality and speed."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-06-20", "contents": "(Shareware release, june 20th missing)\n\n* fish do damage\n* fixed lightning prog crash after killing boss\n* added ctrl-alt-del check in key_event\n* found problem with saving com port enabled in config files\n* drop fish hp\n* added samelevel flag for persistant servers\n* auto advance to next level in ruled deathmatch\n* deathmatch rankings show for 5 sec minimum\n\nnew game should bring up loading plaque\nrewrite buggy screen management\nbig t dest\npain field on shub\nstand in in center\nturn off messages option"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-07-03", "contents": "This little note was issued to a lot of magazines by microsoft recently.

Sigh.\n\nOur goal was to get the NT OpenGL MCD driver model released for win-95, so IHVs could easily make robust, high performance, fully compliant OpenGL implementations. Microsoft has squashed that. Flushed their own (good) work down the toilet.\n\nThe two remaining options are to have vendors create full ICD opengl implementations, or game specific mini-drivers.\n\nFull ICD drivers are provided by intergraph, 3dlabs, real3d, and others, and can run on both NT and 95 (with code changes). Microsoft still supports this, and any vendor can create one, but it is a lot of work to get the provided ICD code up to par, and bug prone. On the plus side, non-game tools like level editors can take full advantage of them.\n\nMinidrivers certainly work fine - we have functional ones for 3dfx and powerVR, and they have the possibility of providing slightly better performance than fully compliant drivers, but partial implementations are going to cause problems in the future.\n\nWe will see some of both types of drivers over the next year, and Quake 2 should work fine with either.

We have played with some early versions, but this is a paper evaluation. I am not in a position to judge 2D GDI issues or TV/DVD issues, so this is just 3D commentary.\n\nNvidia Marketing silliness: saying \"seven operations on a pixel\" for a dual texture chip. Yes, I like NV_register_combiners a lot, but come on..\n\nThe DDR GeForce is the reigning champ of 3D cards. Of the shipping boards, it is basically better than everyone at every aspect of 3D graphics, and pioneered some features that are going to be very important: signed pixel math, dot product blending, and cubic environment maps.\n\nThe GeForce2 is just a speed bumped GeForce with a few tweaks, but that's not a bad thing. Nvidia will have far and away the tightest drivers for quite some time, and that often means more than a lot of new features in the real world.\n\nThe nvidia register combiners are highly programmable, and can often save a rendering pass or allow a somewhat higher quality calculation, but on the whole, I would take ATI's third texture for flexibility.\n\nNvidia will probably continue to hit the best framerates in benchmarks at low resolution, because they have flexible hardware with geometry acceleration and well-tuned drivers.\n\nGeForce is my baseline for current rendering work, so I can wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nATI Marketing silliness: \"charisma engine\" and \"pixel tapestry\" are silly names for vertex and pixel processing that are straightforward improvements over existing methods. Sony is probably to blame for starting that.\n\nThe Radeon has the best feature set available, with several advantages over GeForce:\n\nA third texture unit per pixel \nThree dimensional textures \nDependent texture reads (bump env map) \nGreater internal color precision. \nUser clip planes orthogonal to all rasterization modes. \nMore powerful vertex blending operations. \nThe shadow id map support may be useful, but my work with shadow buffers have shown them to have significant limitations for global use in a game.\n\nOn paper, it is better than GeForce in almost every way except that it is limited to a maximum of two pixels per clock while GeForce can do four. This comes into play when the pixels don't do as much memory access, for example when just drawing shadow planes to the depth/stencil buffer, or when drawing in roughly front to back order and many of the later pixels depth fail, avoiding the color buffer writes.\n\nDepending on the application and algorithm, this can be anywhere from basically no benefit when doing 32 bit blended multi-pass, dual texture rendering to nearly double the performance for 16 bit rendering with compressed textures. In any case, a similarly clocked GeForce(2) should somewhat outperform a Radeon on today's games when fill rate limited. Future games that do a significant number of rendering passes on the entire world may go back in ATI's favor if they can use the third texture unit, but I doubt it will be all that common.\n\nThe real issue is how quickly ATI can deliver fully clocked production boards, bring up stable drivers, and wring all the performance out of the hardware. This is a very different beast than the Rage128. I would definitely recommend waiting on some consumer reviews to check for teething problems before upgrading to a Radeon, but if things go well, ATI may give nvidia a serious run for their money this year.\n\n3DFX Marketing silliness: Implying that a voodoo 5 is of a different class than a voodoo 4 isn't right. Voodoo 4 max / ultra / SLI / dual / quad or something would have been more forthright.\n\nRasterization feature wise, voodoo4 is just catching up to the original TNT. We finally have 32 bit color and stencil. Yeah.\n\nThere aren't any geometry features.\n\nThe T buffer is really nothing more than an accumulation buffer that is averaged together during video scanout. This same combining of separate buffers can be done by any modern graphics card if they are set up for it (although they will lose two bits of color precision in the process). At around 60 fps there is a slight performance win by doing it at video scannout time, but at 30 fps it is actually less memory traffic to do it explicitly. Video scan tricks also usually don't work in windowed modes.\n\nThe real unique feature of the voodoo5 is subpixel jittering during rasterization, which can't reasonably be emulated by other hardware. This does indeed improve the quality of anti-aliasing, although I think 3dfx might be pushing it a bit by saying their 4 sample jittering is as good as 16 sample unjittered.\n\nThe saving grace of the voodoo5 is the scalability. Because it only uses SDR ram, a dual chip Voodoo5 isn't all that much faster than some other single chip cards, but the quad chip card has over twice the pixel fill rate of the nearest competitor. That is a huge increment. Voodoo5 6000 should win every benchmark that becomes fill rate limited.\n\nI haven't been able to honestly recommend a voodoo3 to people for a long time, unless they had a favorite glide game or wanted early linux Xfree 4.0 3D support. Now (well, soon), a Voodoo5 6000 should make all of today's games look better than any other card. You can get over twice as many pixel samples, and have them jittered and blended together for anti-aliasing.\n\nIt won't be able to hit Q3 frame rates as high as GeForce, but if you have a high end processor there really may not be all that much difference for you between 100fps and 80fps unless you are playing hardcore competitive and can't stand the occasional drop below 60fps.\n\nThere are two drawbacks: it's expensive, and it won't take advantage of the new rasterization features coming in future games. It probably wouldn't be wise to buy a voodoo5 if you plan on keeping it for two years."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-10-04", "contents": "* allow cg_thirdPerson and cg_thirdPersonRange in games\n* added execed .cfg files to journal file\n* single pass plasma explosion effect to save overdraw\n* rescaled and sized gib and mark blood to save a lot of overdraw\n* fixed cg.time < snapshot time on vid_restart\n* cl_showSend network debugging tool\n* back to requiring a before commands on the console to distinguish them from chat messages.

Primarily by saving transforms for the lightmap pass and doing tightly packed vertex arrays for the enemy models.\n\nThe big drawback is that every codepath that gets added holds back future innovation.

It is a significant disadvantage, no question about it, but you can still have a good game if you play smart. If there is someone that knows what they are doing on a server with a ping in the low 100s, there won't usually be much you can do, but a skilled modem player can still beat up on unskilled T1 players..\n\nMake sure your modem rate is set correctly. If you have it set too high, large amounts of data can get buffered up and you can wind up with multiple seconds of screwed up delays.\n\nOnly play on servers with good pings. My connection gives me a couple dozen servers with mid 200 pings. 56k modems often see servers with sub 200 pings. If you ignore the ping and just look for your favorite map, you will probably have a crappy game.\n\nIf you have a good basic connection to the server, the thing that will mess up your game is too much visible activity. This is a characteristic of the number of players, the openness of the level, and the weapons in use.\n\nDon't play on madhouse levels with tons of players. None of the normal Q3 maps were really designed for more than eight players, and many were only designed for four.\n\nDon't play in the wide open maps unless there are only a couple other players. Four very active players in a wide open area are enough to bog down a modem connection.\n\nI just implemented \"sv_minPing\" / \"sv_maxPing\" options so servers can restrict themselves to only low ping or high ping players. This is done based on the ping of the challenge response packet, rather than any in-game pings. There are a few issues with that - a LPB may occasionally get into a HPB server if they happen to get a network hiccup at just the right time, and the number used as a gate will be closer to the number shown in the server list, rather than the number seen in gameplay. I would reccomend \"sv_minPing 200\" as a reasonable breakpoint."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-05-19", "contents": "Now that all the E3 stuff is done with, I can get back to work...\n\nI was stuck in a room the entire time doing press interviews, but it seemed to have gone well.

Sigh.\n\nThe \"download\" crashtest was first reported by Rick Hammerstone. That was a pure dumbass mistake on my part.\n\nI should be sending the accumulated crashtest bounties off tomorrow.\n\nThe plan right now is to have an update release next week that will have lots of bug fixes and cheat protections, but not too many new user visible features.\n\nI finally got around to implementing dual processor acceleration today. I still have a couple issues to resolve and some more rearranging to do, but it is giving 20%+ speedup right now in a worst-case situation for it.\n\nWhen completed, I expect the average speedup to be in the 40% to 80% range, depending on what is going on and the video configuration. Scenes with lots of dynamic lighting and lots of sounds and other client processing going will show the largest speedups. It helps the slow scenes more than the fast scenes, which is basically what you want.\n\nI am going to shake this out with the Windows (NT) code first, but it should definately make its way to the linux port eventually.\n\nI know SMP is a que for all the BeOS folks to ask about ports, so I'm going to head that off: Be has all the code for Q3 (and Q2, for that matter), and a version of Q3test should be available by the time they ship a release OS with OpenGL hardware acceleration.\n\nThere will probably also be an SGI-irix port.\n\nRegarding both of those ports: they are not supported ports, and will be maintained by volenteers (like the current MacOS X port).

Lava emits light from the entire surface.\n\nThe simulation of the light is realistic now, instead of just hacked together.  Light reflects off of surfaces, so ceilings will get lit even if there is no light pointing directly at them.  The way light flows around corners looks eerily realistic.\n\nI fixed the sky volumes so missiles dissapear inside them again, which was necessary to implement a new lighting feature: you can specify the position of the sun (or moon) in degrees,  and the amount of light it will emit.  The light then comes out completely parallel and at a constant intensity, passing through sky volumes to light up all outdoor areas in a consistant way. (this could be retrofited onto light.exe for people unable to run qrad)\n\nNow for the bad news: a full size level takes several minutes to process on our quad alpha, and you MUST do a vis before running qrad (otherwise it would take about 1000 times longer).  This wouldn't be out of reach even on mortal pentium systems (you can ask for a rough aproximation instead of the full job), except for the working set size.  >100 megs.  I'm NOT being wasteful here, either.  I use a halved bit array for visibility interconnects, and sparse scaled shorts for energy transference.\n\nI will release the source after we have been using it in production for a while, in case anyone wants to take a shot at reformulating it to be less memory intensive.  It would be possible to get it down to 32 megs with some reduction in quality and a lot more wasted time, but then the run time would be obnoxious.  I expect homebrew levels are going to have to stick with light.exe.\n\nI am looking forward to doing a little more work on the other utilities as well.  I want to break qbsp up into three seperate programs, so it will be able to run on machines with <32 megs of memory.  Light can be sped up significantly if the PVS information is taken advantage of the way I did in qrad. I also have some theories on changing the algorithmic order of full vis processing time that I want to look into, especially now that the vis stage is put before production lighting."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-09-10", "contents": "* don't precache player model in single player games\n* dynamically change maxplayers\n\n+ move null files into a seperate directory?\n+ alt sticking\n+ maxmoveleafs error\n\nteleport in flash is still wrong on second level\nstuck on wall with low grav jumping\nallow minimize?\nwin95 memory paging\nstill have some tjunctions"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-11-06", "contents": "Over the weekend, I ported Quake to open-gl / win32.

I love my iPhone, and I think the App Store is an extremely important model for the software business.  Unfortunately, things have conspired against us being out early on the platform.\n\nRobert Duffy and I spent a week early on starting to bring up the Orcs & Elves DS codebase on the iPhone, which would have been a nice project for a launch title, but it wasn't going to be a slam dunk.  The iPhone graphics hardware is a more capable superset of the DS hardware (the driver overhead is far, far worse, though), but the codebase was fairly DS specific, with lots of Nintendo API calls all over the place.  I got the basics drawing by converting things to OpenGL ES, but I was still on the fence as to whether the best approach to get all the picky little special effects working would be a complete GL conversion, or a DS graphics library emulation layer.  Coupled with the fact that the entire user interface would need to be re-thought and re-tested, it was clear that the project would take several months of development time, and need artists and designers as well as coding work.  I made the pitch that this would still be a good plan, but the idMobile team was already committed to the Wolfenstein RPG project for conventional Java and BREW mobile phones, and Anna didn't want to slip a scheduled milestone on the established, successful development directions there for a speculative iPhone project.\n\nAfter thinking about the platform's capabilities a bit more, I had a plan for an aggressive, iPhone specific project that we actually started putting some internal resources on, but the programmer tasked with it didn't work out and was let go.  In an odd coincidence, an outside development team came to us with a proposal for a similar project on the Wii, and we decided to have them work on the iPhone project with us instead.  We should be announcing this project soon, and it is cool.  It is also late, but that's software development...\n\nLate last year, the mobile team had finished up all the planned versions of Wolfenstein RPG, but EA had suggested that in addition to the hundreds of customized versions they normally produce for all the various mobile phones, they were interested in having another team do a significant media quality improvement on it for the iPhone.  While Wolf RPG is a very finely crafted product for traditional cell phones, it wasn't designed for the iPhone's interface or capabilities, so it wouldn't be an ideal project, but it should still be worth doing.  When we got the first build to test, I was pleased with how the high res artwork looked, but I was appalled at how slow it ran.  It felt like one of the mid range java versions, not better than the high end BREW as I expected.  I started to get a sinking feeling.  I searched around in the level for a view that would confirm my suspicion, and when I found a clear enough view of some angled geometry I saw the tell-tale mid-polygon affine swim in the texture as I rotated.  They were using the software rasterizer on the iPhone.  I patted myself on the back a bit for the fact that the combination of my updated mobile renderer, the intelligent level design / restricted movement, and the hi-res artwork made the software renderer almost visually indistinguishable from a hardware renderer, but I was very unhappy about the implementation.\n\nI told EA that we were NOT going to ship that as the first Id Software product on the iPhone.  Using the iPhone's hardware 3D acceleration was a requirement, and it should be easy -- when I did the second generation mobile renderer (written originally in java) it was layered on top of a class I named TinyGL that did the transform / clip / rasterize operations fairly close to OpenGL semantics, but in fixed point and with both horizontal and vertical rasterization options for perspective correction.  The developers came back and said it would take two months and exceed their budget.\n\nRather than having a big confrontation over the issue, I told them to just send the project to me and I would do it myself.  Cass Everitt had been doing some personal work on the iPhone, so he helped me get everything set up for local iPhone development here, which is a lot more tortuous than you would expect from an Apple product.  As usual, my off the cuff estimate of \"Two days!\" was optimistic, but I did get it done in four, and the game is definitely more pleasant at 8x the frame rate. \n\nAnd I had fun doing it.\n\nSince we now were doing something resembling \"real work\" on the iPhone at the office, we kept it going at a low priority.  One of the projects Cass was tinkering around with at home was a port of Quake 3, and we talked about different interface strategies every now and then. \n\nUnfortunately, when we sat down to try a few things out, we found that Q3 wasn't really running fast enough to make good judgments on iPhone control systems.  The hardware should be capable enough, but it will take some architectural changes to the rendering code to get the most out of it.\n\nI was just starting to set up a framework to significantly revise Q3 when I considered the possibility of just going to an earlier codebase to experiment with initially.  If we wanted to factor performance out of the equation, we could go all the way back to Wolfenstein 3D, the grandfather of FPS games.  It had the basic run and gun play that has been built on for fifteen years, but it originally ran on 286 computers, so it should be pretty trivial to hold a good framerate on the iPhone.\n\nWolfenstein was originally written in Borland C and TASM for DOS, but I had open sourced the code long ago, and there were several projects that had updated the original code to work on OpenGL and modern operating systems.  After a little looking around, I found Wolf3D Redux at http://wolf3dredux.sourceforge.net/.  One of the development comments about \"removal of the gangrenous 16 bit code\" made me smile.\n\nIt was nice and simple to download, extract data from a commercial copy of Wolfenstein, and start playing on a PC at high resolution.  Things weren't as smooth as they should be at first, but two little changes made a huge difference -- going at VBL synced update rates with one tic per cycle instead of counting milliseconds to match 70 hz game tics, and fixing a bug with premature integralization in the angle update code that caused mouse movement to be notchier than it should be.  The game was still fun to play after all these years, and I began to think that it might be worthwhile to actually make a product out of Wolfenstein on the iPhone, rather than just using it as a testbed, assuming the controls worked out as fun to play.  The simple episodic nature of the game would make it easy to split up into a $0.99 version with just the first episode, a more expensive version with all sixty levels, and we could release Spear of Destiny if there was additional demand.  I was getting a little ahead of myself without a fun-to-play demonstration of feasibility on the iPhone, but the idea of moving the entire line of classic Id titles over -- Wolf, Doom, Quake, Quake 2, and Quake Arena, was starting to sound like a real good idea.\n\nI sent an email to the Wolf 3D Redux project maintainer to see if he might be interested in working on an iPhone project with us, but it had been over a year since the last update, and he must have moved on to other things.  I thought about it a bit, and decided that I would go ahead and do the project myself.  The \"big projects\" at Id are always top priority, but the systems programming work in Rage is largely completed, and the team hasn't been gated on me for anything in a while.  There is going to be memory and framerate optimization  work going on until it ships, but I decided that I could spend a couple weeks away from Rage to work on the iPhone exclusively.  Cass continued to help with iPhone system issues, I drafted Eric Will to create the few new art assets, and Christian Antkow did the audio work, but this was the first time I had taken full responsibility for an entire product in a very long time.\n\n@Design notes@\n\nThe big question was how \"classic\" should we leave the game?  I have bought various incarnations of Super Mario Bros on at least four Nintendo platforms, so I think there is something to be said for the classics, but there were so many options for improvement.  The walls and sprites in the game were originally all 64 x 64 x 8 bit color, and the sound effects were either 8khz / 8 bit mono or (sometimes truly awful) FM synth sounds.  Changing these would be trivial from a coding standpoint.  In the end, I decided to leave the game media pretty much unchanged, but tweak the game play a little bit, and build a new user framework around the core play experience.  This decision was made a lot easier by the fact that we were right around the 10 meg over-the-air app download limit with the converted media.  This would probably be the only Id project to ever be within hailing distance of that mark, so we should try to fit it in.\n\nThe original in-game status bar display had to go, because the user's thumbs were expected to cover much of that area.  We could have gone with just floating stats, but I thought that BJ's face added a lot of personality to the game, so I wanted to leave that in the middle of the screen.  Unfortunately, the way the weapon graphics were drawn, especially the knife, caused issues if they were just drawn above the existing face graphics.  I had a wider background created for the face, and used the extra space for directional damage indicators, which was a nice improvement in the gameplay.  It was a tough decision to stop there on damage feedback, because a lot of little things with view roll kicks, shaped screen blends, and even double vision or blurring effects, are all pretty easy to add and quite effective, but getting farther away from \"classic\".\n\nI started out with an explicit \"open door\" button like the original game, but I quickly decided to just make that automatic.  Wolf and Doom had explicit \"use\" buttons, but we did away with them on Quake with contact or proximity activation on everything.  Modern games have generally brought explicit activation back by situationally overriding attack, but hunting for push walls in Wolf by shooting every tile wouldn't work out.  There were some combat tactics involving explicitly shutting doors that are gone with automatic-use, and some secret push walls are trivially found when you pick up an item in front of them now, but this was definitely the right decision.\n\nYou could switch weapons in Wolf, but almost nobody actually did, except for occasionally conserving ammo with the chain gun, or challenges like \"beat the game with only the knife\".  That functionality didn't justify the interface clutter.\n\nThe concept of \"lives\" was still in wolf, with 1-ups and extras at certain scores.  We ditched that in Doom, which was actually sort of innovative at the time, since action games on computers and consoles were still very much take-the-quarter arcade oriented.  I miss the concept of \"score\" in a lot of games today, but I think the finite and granular nature of the enemies, tasks, and items in Wolf is better suited to end-of-level stats, so I removed both lives and score, but added persistent awards for par time, 100% kills, 100% secrets, and 100% treasures.  The award alone wasn't enough incentive to make treasures relevant, so I turned them into uncapped +1 health crumbs, which makes you always happy to find them.\n\nI increased the pickup radius for items, which avoided the mild frustration of having to sometimes make a couple passes at an item when you are cleaning up a room full of stuff.\n\nI doubled the starting ammo on a fresh level start.  If a player just got killed, it isn't good to frustrate them even more with a severe ammo conservation constraint.  There was some debate about the right way to handle death:  respawn with the level as is (good in that you can keep making progress if you just get one more shot off each time, bad in that weapon pickups are no longer available), respawn just as you entered the level (good -- keep your machinegun / chaingun, bad -- you might have 1 health), or, what I chose, restart the map with basic stats just as if you had started the map from the menu.\n\nThere are 60 levels in the original Wolf dataset, and I wanted people to have the freedom to easily jump around between different levels and skills, so there is no enforcement of starting at the beginning.  The challenge is to /complete /a level, not /get to/ a level.  It is fun to start filling in the grid of level completions and awards, and it often feels better to try a different level after a death.  The only exception to the start-anywhere option is that you must find the entrance to the secret levels before you can start a new game there.\n\nIn watching the early testers, the biggest issue I saw was people sliding off doors before they opened, and having to maneuver back around to go through.  In Wolf, as far as collision detection was concerned, everything was just a 64x64 tile map that was either solid or passable. \n\nDoors changed the tile state when they completed opening or began closing.  There was discussion about magnetizing the view angle towards doors, or somehow beveling the areas around the doors, but it turned out to be pretty easy to make the door tiles only have a solid central core against the player, so players would slide into the \"notch\" with the door until it opened.  This made a huge improvement in playability.\n\nThere is definitely something to be said for a game that loads in a few seconds, with automatic save of your position when you exit.  I did a lot of testing by playing the game, exiting to take notes in the iPhone notepad, then restarting Wolf to resume playing.  Not having to skip through animated logos at the start is nice.  We got this pretty much by accident with the very small and simple nature of Wolf, but I think it is worth specifically optimizing for in future titles.\n\nThe original point of this project was to investigate FPS control schemes for the iPhone, and a lot of testing was done with different schemes and parameters.  I was sort of hoping that there would be one \"obviously correct\" way to control it, but it doesn't turn out to be the case.\n\nFor a casual first time player, it is clearly best to have a single forward / back / turn control stick and a fire button.\n\nTilt control is confusing for first exposure to the game, but I think it does add to the fun factor when you use it.  I like the tilt-to-move option, but people that play a lot of driving games on the iPhone seem to like tilt-to-turn, where you are sort of driving BJ through the levels.  Tilt needs a decent deadband, and a little bit of filtering is good.  I was surprised that the precision on the accelerometer was only a couple degrees, which makes it poorly suited for any direct mapped usage, but it works well enough as a relative speed control.\n\nSerious console gamers tend to take to the \"dual stick\" control modes easily for movement, but the placement of the fire button is problematic.  Using an index finger to fire is effective but uncomfortable.  I see many players just move the thumb to fire, using strafe movement for fine tuning aim.  It is almost tempting to try to hijack the side volume switch for fire, but the ergonomics aren't quite right, and it would be very un-Apple-like, and wouldn't be available on the iPod touch (plus I couldn't figure out how...).\n\nWe tried a tilt-forward to fire to allow you to keep your thumbs on the dual control sticks, but it didn't work out very well.  Forward / back tilt has the inherent variable holding angle problem for anything, and a binary transition point is hard for people to hold without continuous feedback.  Better visual feedback on the current angle and trip point would help, but we didn't pursue it much.  For a game with just, say, a rocket launcher, shake/shove-to-fire might be interesting, but it isn't any good for wolf.\n\nIt was critical for the control sticks to be analog, since digital direction pads have proven quite ineffective on touch screens due to progressive lack of registration during play.  With an analog stick, the player has continuous visual feedback of the stick position in most cases, so they can self correct.  Tuning the deadband and slide off behavior are important.\n\nLevel design criteria has advanced a lot since Wolfenstein, but I wasn't going to open up the option of us modifying the levels, even though the start of the first level is painfully bad for a first time player, with the tiny, symmetric rooms for them to get their nose mashed into walls and turned around in.  The idea is that you started the game in a prison cell after bashing your guard over the head, but even with the exact same game tools, we would lead the player through the experience much better now.  Some of the levels are still great fun to play, and it is interesting to read Tom Hall and John Romero's designer notes in the old hint manuals, but the truth is that some levels were scrubbed out in only a couple hours, unlike the long process of testing and adjustment that goes on today.\n\nIt was only after I thought I was basically done with the game that Tim Willits pointed out the elephant in the gameplay room -- for 95% of players, wandering around lost in a maze isn't very much fun. \n\nImplementing an automap was pretty straightforward, and it probably added more to the enjoyment of the game than anything else.  Before adding this, I thought that only a truly negligible amount of people would actually finish all 60 levels, but now I think there might be enough people that get through them to justify bringing the Spear of Destiny levels over later.\n\nWhen I was first thinking about the project I sort of assumed that we wouldn't bother with music, but Wolf3D Redux already had code that converted the old id music format into ogg, so we would up with support at the beginning, and it turned out pretty good.  We wound up ripping the red book audio tracks from one of the later commercial Wolf releases and encoding at a different bitrate, but I probably wouldn't have bothered if not for the initial support.  It would have been nice to re-record the music with a high quality MIDI synth, but we didn't have the original MIDI source, and Christian said that the conversion back from the id music format to midi was a little spotty, and would take a fair amount of work to get right.  I emailed Bobby Prince, the original composer, to see if he had any high quality versions still around, but he didn't get back with me.\n\nThe game is definitely simplistic by modern standards, but it still has its moments.  Getting the drop on a brown shirt just as he is pulling his pistol from the holster.  Making an SS do the \"twitchy dance\" with your machine gun.  Rounding a corner and unloading your weapon on ... a potted plant.  Simplistic plays well on the iPhone. \n\n@Programming notes@\n\nCass and I got the game running on the iPhone very quickly, but I was a little disappointed that various issues around the graphics driver, the input processing, and the process scheduling meant that doing a locked-at-60-hz game on the iPhone wasn't really possible.  I hope to take these up with Apple at some point in the future, but it meant that Wolf would be a roughly two tick game.  It is only \"roughly\" because there is no swapinterval support, and the timer scheduling has a lot of variability in it.  It doesn't seem to matter all that much, the play is still smooth and fun, but I would have liked to at least contrast it with the perfect limit case.\n\nIt turns out that there were a couple issues that required work even at 30hz.  For a game like Wolf, any PC that is in use today is essentially infinitely fast, and the Wolf3D Redux code did some things that were convenient but wasteful.  That is often exactly the right thing to do, but the iPhone isn't quite as infinitely fast as a desktop PC.\n\nWolfenstein (and Doom) originally drew the characters as sparse stretched columns of solid pixels (vertical instead of horizontal for efficiency in interleaved planar mode-X VGA), but OpenGL versions need to generate a square texture with transparent pixels.  Typically this is then drawn by either alpha blending or alpha testing a big quad that is mostly empty space.  You could play through several early levels of Wolf without this being a problem, but in later levels there are often large fields of dozens of items that stack up to enough overdraw to max out the GPU and drop the framerate to 20 fps.  The solution is to bound the solid pixels in the texture and only draw that restricted area, which solves the problem with most items, but Wolf has a few different heavily used ceiling lamp textures that have a small lamp at the top and a thin but full width shadow at the bottom.  A single bounds doesn't exclude many texels, so I wound up including two bounds, which made them render many times faster.\n\nThe other problem was CPU related.  Wolf3d Redux used the original ray casting scheme to find out which walls were visible, then called a routine to draw each wall tile with OpenGL calls.  The code looked something like this:\n\n[code]DrawWall( int wallNum ) {\n   char   name[128];\n   texture_t   *tex;\n   sprintf( name, \"walls/%d.tga\", wallNum );\n   tex = FindTexture( name );\n   ...\n}\ntexture_t FindTexture( const char *name ) {\n   int   i;\n   for ( i = 0 ; i < numTextures ; i++ ) {\n      if ( !strcmp( name, texture[name]->name ) ) {\n         return texture[name];\n      }\n   }\n   ...\n} [/code]\n\nI winced when I saw that at the top of the instruments profile, but again, you could play all the early levels that only had twenty or thirty visible tiles at a time without it actually being a problem.  However, some later levels with huge open areas could have over a hundred visible tiles, and that led to 20hz again.  The solution was a trivial change to something resembling:\n\n[code]DrawWall( int wallNum ) {\n   texture_t   *tex = wallTextures[wallNum];\n   ...\n} [/code]\n\nWolf3D Redux included a utility that extracted the variously packed media from the original games and turned them into cleaner files with modern formats.  Unfortunately, an attempt at increasing the quality of the original art assets by using hq2x graphics scaling to turn the 64x64 art into better filtered 128x128 arts was causing lots of sprites to have fringes around them due to incorrect handling of alpha borders.  It wasn't possible to fix it up at load time, so I had to do the proper outline-with-color-but-0-alpha operations in a modified version of the extractor.  I also decided to do all the format conversion and mip generation there, so there was no significant CPU time spent during texture loading, helping to keep the load time down.  I experimented with the PVRTC formats, but while it would have been ok for the walls, unlike with DXT you can't get a lossless alpha mask out of it, so it wouldn't have worked for the sprites.  Besides, you really don't want to mess with the carefully chosen pixels in a 64x64 block very much when you scale it larger than the screen on occasion.\n\nI also had to make one last minute hack change to the original media -- the Red Cross organization had asserted their trademark rights over red crosses (sigh) some time after we released the original Wolfenstein 3D game, and all new game releases must not use red crosses on white backgrounds as health symbols.  One single, solitary sprite graphic got modified for this release.\n\nUser interface code was the first thing I started making other programmers do at Id when I no longer had to write every line of code in a project, because I usually find it tedious and unrewarding.  This was such a small project that I went ahead and did it myself, and I learned an interesting little thing.  Traditionally, UI code has separate drawing and input processing code, but on a touchscreen device, it often works well to do a combined \"immediate mode interface\", with code like this: \n\n[code]if ( DrawPicWithTouch( x, y, w, h, name ) ) {\n\tmenuState = newState;\n} [/code]\n\nDoing that for the floating user gameplay input controls would introduce a frame of response latency, but for menus and such, it works very well.\n\nOne of the worst moments during the development was when I was getting ready to hook up the automatic savegame on app exit.  There wasn't any savegame code.  I went back and grabbed the original 16 bit dos code for load / save game, but when I compiled I found out that the Wolf3d Redux codebase had changed a lot more than just the near / far pointer issues, asm code, and comment blocks.  The changes were sensible things, like grouping more variables into structures and defining enums for more things, but it did mean that I wasn't dealing with the commercially tested core that I thought I was.  It also meant that I was a lot more concerned about a strange enemy lerping through the world bug I had seen a couple times.\n\nI seriously considered going back to the virgin codebase and reimplementing the OpenGL rendering from scratch.  The other thing that bothered me about the Redux codebase was that it was basically a graft of the Wolf3D code into the middle of a gutted Quake 2 codebase.  This was cool in some ways, because it gave us a console, cvars, and the system / OpenGL portable framework, and it was clear the original intention was to move towards multiplayer functionality, but it was a lot of bloat.  The original wolf code was only a few dozen C files, while the framework around it here was several times that.\n\nLooking through the original code brought back some memories.  I stopped signing code files years ago, but the top of WL_MAIN.C made me smile:\n\n[code]/*\n=============================================================================\n\nWOLFENSTEIN 3-D\n\nAn Id Software production\n\nby John Carmack\n\n=============================================================================\n*/ [/code]\n\nIt wasn't dated, but that would have been in 1991.\n\nIn the end, I decided to stick with the Redux codebase, but I got a lot more free with hacking big chunks of it out.  I reimplemented load / save game (fixing the inevitable pointer bugs involved), and by littering asserts throughout the code, I tracked the other problem down to an issue with making a signed comparison against one of the new enum types that compare as unsigned.  I'm still not positive if this was the right call, since the codebase is sort of a mess with lots of vestigial code that doesn't really do anything, and I don't have time to clean it all up right now.\n\nOf course, someone else is welcome to do that.  The full source code for the commercial app is available on the web site.  There was a little thought given to the fact that if I had reverted to the virgin source, the project wouldn't be required to be under the GPL.  Wolf and the app store presents a sort of unique situation -- a user can't just compile the code and choose not to pay for the app, because most users aren't registered developers, and the data isn't readily available, but there is actually some level of commercial risk in the fast-moving iPhone development community.  It will not be hard to take the code that is already fun to play, pull a bunch of fun things off the net out of various projects people have done with the code over the years, dust off some old map editors, and load up with some modern quality art and sound.\n\nEveryone is perfectly within their rights to go do that, and they can aggressively try to bury the original game if they want.  However, I think there is actually a pretty good opportunity for cooperation.  If anyone makes a quality product and links to the original Wolf app, we can start having links to \"wolf derived\" or \"wolf related\" projects. \n\nThat should turn out to be a win for everyone.\n\nI'm going back to Rage for a while, but I do expect Classic Doom to come fairly soon for the iPhone.\n"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-02-18", "contents": "Ferrari update.\n\nUnless someone can come up with a compelling objection, I think we have an end plan now:\n\nIntergraph is currently holding a very cool clan tournement that will have the finals at E3.

I resisted getting one at all for years, and even now I rarely carry it. To a first approximation, I don't really like talking to most people, so I don't go out of my way to enable people to call me. However, a little while ago I misplaced the old phone I usually take to Armadillo, and my wife picked up a more modern one for me. It had a nice color screen and a bunch of bad java game demos on it. The bad java games did it.\n\n I am a big proponent of temporarily changing programming scope every once in a while to reset some assumptions and habits. After Quake 3, I spent some time writing driver code for the Utah-GLX project to give myself more empathy for the various hardware vendors and get back to some low-level register programming. This time, I decided I was going to work on a cell phone game.\n\n I wrote a couple java programs several years ago, and I was left with a generally favorable impression of the language. I dug out my old \"java in a nutshell\" and started browsing around on the web for information on programming for cell phones. After working my way through the alphabet soup of J2ME, CLDC, and MIDP, I've found that writing for the platform is pretty easy.\n\n In fact, I think it would be an interesting environment for beginning programmers to learn on. I started programming on an Apple II a long time ago, when you could just do an \"hgr\" and start drawing to the screen, which was rewarding. For years, I've had misgivings about people learning programming on Win32 (unix / X would be even worse), where it takes a lot of arcane crap just to get to the point of drawing something on the screen and responding to input. I assume most beginners wind up with a lot of block copied code that they don't really understand.\n\n All the documentation and tools needed are free off the web, and there is an inherent neatness to being able to put the program on your phone and walk away from the computer. I wound up using the latest release of NetBeans with the mobility module, which works pretty well. It certainly isn't MSDev, but for a free IDE it seems very capable. On the downside, MIDP debugging sessions are very flaky, and there is something deeply wrong when text editing on a 3.6 ghz processor is anything but instantaneous.\n\n I spent a while thinking about what would actually make a good game for the platform, which is a very different design space than PCs or consoles. The program and data sizes are tiny, under 200k for java jar files. A single texture is larger than that in our mainstream games. The data sizes to screen ratios are also far out of the range we are used to. A 128x128x16+ bit color screen can display some very nice graphics, but you could only store a half dozen uncompressed screens in your entire size budget. Contrast with PCs, which may be up to a few megabytes of display data, but the total game data may be five hundred times that.\n\n You aren't going to be able to make an immersive experience on a 2\" screen, no matter what the graphics look like. Moody and atmospheric are pretty much out. Stylish and fun is about the best you can do.\n\n The standard cell phone style discrete button direction pad with a center action button is a good interface for one handed navigation and selection, but it sucks for games, where you really want a game boy style rocking direction pad for one thumb, and a couple separate action buttons for the other thumb. These styles of input are in conflict with each other, so it may never get any better. The majority of traditional action games just don't work well with cell phone style input.\n\n Network packet latency is bad, and not expected to be improving in the foreseeable future, so multiplayer action games are pretty much out (but see below).\n\n I have a small list of games that I think would work out well, but what I decided to work on is DoomRPG - sort of Bard's Tale meets Doom. Step based smooth sliding/turning tile movement and combat works out well for the phone input buttons, and exploring a 3D world through the cell phone window is pretty neat. We talked to Jamdat about the business side of things, and hired Fountainhead Entertainment to turn my proof-of-concept demo and game plans into a full-featured game.\n\n So, for the past month or so I have been spending about a day a week on cell phone development. Somewhat to my surprise, there is very little internal conflict switching off from the high end work during the day with gigs of data and multi-hundred instruction fragment shaders down to texture mapping in java at night with one table lookup per pixel and 100k of graphics. It's all just programming and design work.\n\n It turns out that I'm a lot less fond of Java for resource-constrained work. I remember all the little gripes I had with the Java language, like no unsigned bytes, and the consequences of strong typing, like no memset, and the inability to read resources into anything but a char array, but the frustrating issues are details down close to the hardware.\n\n The biggest problem is that Java is really slow. On a pure cpu / memory / display / communications level, most modern cell phones should be considerably better gaming platforms than a Game Boy Advanced. With Java, on most phones you are left with about the CPU power of an original 4.77 mhz IBM PC, and lousy control over everything.\n\n I spent a fair amount of time looking at java byte code disassembly while optimizing my little rendering engine. This is interesting fun like any other optimization problem, but it alternates with a bleak knowledge that even the most inspired java code is going to be a fraction the performance of pedestrian native C code.\n\n Even compiled to completely native code, Java semantic requirements like range checking on every array access hobble it. One of the phones (Motorola i730) has an option that does some load time compiling to improve performance, which does help a lot, but you have no idea what it is doing, and innocuous code changes can cause the compilable heuristic to fail.\n\n Write-once-run-anywhere. Ha. Hahahahaha. We are only testing on four platforms right now, and not a single pair has the exact same quirks. All the commercial games are tweaked and compiled individually for each (often 100+) platform. Portability is not a justification for the awful performance.\n\n Security on a cell phone is justification for doing something, but an interpreter isn't a requirement - memory management units can do just as well. I suspect this did have something to do with Java's adoption early on. A simple embedded processor with no MMU could run arbitrary programs securely with java, which might make it the only practical option. However, once you start using blazingly fast processors to improve the awful performance, a MMU with a classic OS model looks a whole lot better.\n\n Even saddled with very low computing performance, tighter implementation of the platform interface could help out a lot. I'm not seeing very conscientious work on the platforms so far. For instance, there is just no excuse for having 10+ millisecond granularity in timing. Given that the java paradigm is sort of thread-happy anyway, having a real scheduler that Does The Right Thing with priorities and hardware interfacing would be an obvious thing. Pressing a key should generate a hardware interrupt, which should immediately activate the key listening thread, which should be able to immediately kill an in-process rendering and restart another one if desired. The attitude seems to be 15 msec here, 20 there, stick it on a queue, finish up a timeslice, who cares, right?\n\n I suspect I will enjoy working with BREW, the competing standard for cell phone games. It lets you use raw C/C++ code, or even, I suppose, assembly language, which completely changes the design options. Unfortunately, they only have a quarter the market share that the J2ME phones have. Also, the relatively open java platform development strategy is what got me into this in the first place - one night I just tried writing a program for my cell phone, which isn't possible for the more proprietary BREW platform.\n\n I have a serious suggestion for the handset designers to go with my idle bitching. I have been told that fixing data packet latency is apparently not in the cards, and it isn't even expected to improve much with the change to 3G infrastructure. Packet data communication seems more modern, and has the luster of the web, but it is worth realizing that for network games and many other flashy Internet technologies like streaming audio and video, we use packets to rather inefficiently simulate a switched circuit.\n\n Cell phones already have a very low latency digital data path - the circuit switched channel used for voice. Some phones have included cellular modems that use either the CSD standard (circuit switched data) at 9.8Kbits or 14.4Kbits or the HSCSD standard (high speed circuit switched data) at 38.4Kbits or 57.6Kbits. Even the 9.8Kbit speed would be great for networked games. A wide variety of two player peer-to-peer games and multiplayer packet server based games could be implemented over this with excellent performance. Gamers generally have poor memories of playing over even the highest speed analog modems, but most of the problems are due to having far too many buffers and abstractions between the data producers/consumers and the actual wire interface. If you wrote eight bytes to the device and it went in the next damned frame (instead of the OS buffer, which feeds into a serial FIFO, which goes into another serial FIFO, which goes into a data compressor, which goes into an error corrector, and probably a few other things before getting into a wire frame), life would be quite good. If you had a real time scheduler, a single frame buffer would be sufficient, but since that isn't likely to happen, having an OS buffer with accurate queries of the FIFO positions is probably best. The worst gaming experiences with modems weren't due to bandwidth or latency, but to buffer pileup."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "2001-11-16", "contents": "Driver optimizations have been discussed a lot lately because of the quake3 name checking in ATI's recent drivers, so I am going to lay out my position on the subject.\n\nThere are many driver optimizations that are pure improvements in all cases, with no negative effects. The difficult decisions come up when it comes to \"trades\" of various kinds, where a change will give an increase in performance, but at a cost.\n\nRelative performance trades. Part of being a driver writer is being able to say \"I don't care if stippled, anti-aliased points with texturing go slow\", and optimizing accordingly. Some hardware features, like caches and hierarchical buffers, may be advantages on some apps, and disadvantages on others. Command buffer sizes often tune differently for different applications.\n\nQuality trades. There is a small amount of wiggle room in the specs for pixel level variability, and some performance gains can be had by leaning towards the minimums. Most quality trades would actually be conformance trades, because the results are not exactly conformant, but they still do \"roughly\" the right thing from a visual standpoint. Compressing textures automatically, avoiding blending of very faint transparent pixels, using a 16 bit depth buffer, etc. A good application will allow the user to make most of these choices directly, but there is good call for having driver preference panels to enable these types of changes on naive applications. Many drivers now allow you to quality trade in an opposite manner - slowing application performance by turning on anti-aliasing or anisotropic texture filtering.\n\nConformance trades. Most conformance trades that happen with drivers are unintentional, where the slower, more general fallback case just didn't get called when it was supposed to, because the driver didn't check for a certain combination to exit some specially optimized path. However, there are optimizations that can give performance improvements in ways that make it impossible to remain conformant. For example, a driver could choose to skip storing of a color value before it is passed on to the hardware, which would save a few cycles, but make it impossible to correctly answer glGetFloatv( GL_CURRENT_COLOR, buffer ).\n\nNormally, driver writers will just pick their priorities and make the trades, but sometimes there will be a desire to make different trades in different circumstances, so as to get the best of both worlds.\n\nExplicit application hints are a nice way to offer different performance characteristics, but that requires cooperation from the application, so it doesn't help in an ongoing benchmark battle. OpenGL's glHint() call is the right thought, but not really set up as flexibly as you would like. Explicit extensions are probably the right way to expose performance trades, but it isn't clear to me that any conformant trade will be a big enough difference to add code for.\n\nEnd-user selectable optimizations. Put a selection option in the driver properties window to allow the user to choose which application class they would like to be favored in some way. This has been done many times, and is a reasonable way to do things. Most users would never touch the setting, so some applications may be slightly faster or slower than in their \"optimal benchmark mode\".\n\nAttempt to guess the application from app names, window strings, etc. Drivers are sometimes forced to do this to work around bugs in established software, and occasionally they will try to use this as a cue for certain optimizations.\n\nMy positions:\n\nMaking any automatic optimization based on a benchmark name is wrong. It subverts the purpose of benchmarking, which is to gauge how a similar class of applications will perform on a tested configuration, not just how the single application chosen as representative performs.\n\nIt is never acceptable to have the driver automatically make a conformance tradeoff, even if they are positive that it won't make any difference. The reason is that applications evolve, and there is no guarantee that a future release won't have different assumptions, causing the upgrade to misbehave. We have seen this in practice with Quake3 and derivatives, where vendors assumed something about what may or may not be enabled during a compiled vertex array call. Most of these are just mistakes, or, occasionally, laziness.\n\nAllowing a driver to present a non-conformant option for the user to select is an interesting question. I know that as a developer, I would get hate mail from users when a point release breaks on their whiz-bang optimized driver, just like I do with overclocked CPUs, and I would get the same \"but it works with everything else!\" response when I tell them to put it back to normal. On the other hand, being able to tweak around with that sort of think is fun for technically inclined users. I lean towards frowning on it, because it is a slippery slope from there down in to \"cheating drivers\" of the see-through- walls variety.\n\nQuality trades are here to stay, with anti-aliasing, anisotropic texture filtering, and other options being positive trades that a user can make, and allowing various texture memory optimizations can be a very nice thing for a user trying to get some games to work well. However, it is still important that it start from a completely conformant state by default. This is one area where application naming can be used reasonably by the driver, to maintain user selected per-application modifiers.\n\nI'm not fanatical on any of this, because the overriding purpose of software is to be useful, rather than correct, but the days of game-specific mini- drivers that can just barely cut it are past, and we should demand more from the remaining vendors.\n\nAlso, excessive optimization is the cause of quite a bit of ill user experience with computers.

We were all very busy at the time, but I took a shot at bringing up support over a weekend. I hadn't coded any of the support for the custom ATI extensions yet, but I ran the game using only standard OpenGL calls (this is not a supported path, because without bump mapping everything looks horrible) to see how it would do. It didn't even draw the console correctly, because they had driver bugs with texGen. I thought the odds were very long against having all the new, untested extensions working properly, so I pushed off working on it until they had revved the drivers a few more times.\n\nMy judgment was colored by the experience of bringing up Doom on the original Radeon card a year earlier, which involved chasing a lot of driver bugs. Note that ATI was very responsive, working closely with me on it, and we were able to get everything resolved, but I still had no expectation that things would work correctly the first time.\n\nNvidia's OpenGL drivers are my \"gold standard\", and it has been quite a while since I have had to report a problem to them, and even their brand new extensions work as documented the first time I try them. When I have a problem on an Nvidia, I assume that it is my fault. With anyone else's drivers, I assume it is their fault. This has turned out correct almost all the time. I have heard more anecdotal reports of instability on some systems with Nivida drivers recently, but I track stability separately from correctness, because it can be influenced by so many outside factors.\n\nATI had been patiently pestering me about support for a few months, so last month I finally took another stab at it. The standard OpenGL path worked flawlessly, so I set about taking advantage of all the 8500 specific features. As expected, I did run into more driver bugs, but ATI got me fixes rapidly, and we soon had everything working properly. It is interesting to contrast the Nvidia and ATI functionality:\n\nThe vertex program extensions provide almost the same functionality. The ATI hardware is a little bit more capable, but not in any way that I care about. The ATI extension interface is massively more painful to use than the text parsing interface from nvidia. On the plus side, the ATI vertex programs are invariant with the normal OpenGL vertex processing, which allowed me to reuse a bunch of code. The Nvidia vertex programs can't be used in multipass algorithms with standard OpenGL passes, because they generate tiny differences in depth values, forcing you to implement EVERYTHING with vertex programs. Nvidia is planning on making this optional in the future, at a slight speed cost.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the vertex object / vertex array range extensions. ATI's extension seems more \"right\" in that it automatically handles synchronization by default, and could be implemented as a wire protocol, but there are advantages to the VAR extension being simply a hint. It is easy to have a VAR program just fall back to normal virtual memory by not setting the hint and using malloc, but ATI's extension requires different function calls for using vertex objects and normal vertex arrays.\n\nThe fragment level processing is clearly way better on the 8500 than on the Nvidia products, including the latest GF4. You have six individual textures, but you can access the textures twice, giving up to eleven possible texture accesses in a single pass, and the dependent texture operation is much more sensible. This wound up being a perfect fit for Doom, because the standard path could be implemented with six unique textures, but required one texture (a normalization cube map) to be accessed twice. The vast majority of Doom light / surface interaction rendering will be a single pass on the 8500, in contrast to two or three passes, depending on the number of color components in a light, for GF3/GF4 (*note GF4 bitching later on).\n\nInitial performance testing was interesting. I set up three extreme cases to exercise different characteristics:\n\nA test of the non-textured stencil shadow speed showed a GF3 about 20% faster than the 8500. I believe that Nvidia has a slightly higher performance memory architecture.\n\nA test of light interaction speed initially had the 8500 significantly slower than the GF3, which was shocking due to the difference in pass count. ATI identified some driver issues, and the speed came around so that the 8500 was faster in all combinations of texture attributes, in some cases 30+% more. This was about what I expected, given the large savings in memory traffic by doing everything in a single pass.\n\nA high polygon count scene that was more representative of real game graphics under heavy load gave a surprising result. I was expecting ATI to clobber Nvidia here due to the much lower triangle count and MUCH lower state change functional overhead from the single pass interaction rendering, but they came out slower. ATI has identified an issue that is likely causing the unexpected performance, but it may not be something that can be worked around on current hardware.\n\nI can set up scenes and parameters where either card can win, but I think that current Nvidia cards are still a somewhat safer bet for consistent performance and quality.\n\nOn the topic of current Nvidia cards:\n\nDo not buy a GeForce4-MX for Doom.\n\nNvidia has really made a mess of the naming conventions here. I always thought it was bad enough that GF2 was just a speed bumped GF1, while GF3 had significant architectural improvements over GF2. I expected GF4 to be the speed bumped GF3, but calling the NV17 GF4-MX really sucks.\n\nGF4-MX will still run Doom properly, but it will be using the NV10 codepath with only two texture units and no vertex shaders. A GF3 or 8500 will be much better performers. The GF4-MX may still be the card of choice for many people depending on pricing, especially considering that many games won't use four textures and vertex programs, but damn, I wish they had named it something else.\n\nAs usual, there will be better cards available from both Nvidia and ATI by the time we ship the game.\n\n8:50 pm addendum: Mark Kilgard at Nvidia said that the current drivers already support the vertex program option to be invarint with the fixed function path, and that it turned out to be one instruction FASTER, not slower."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1998-05-22", "contents": "Congratulations to Epic, Unreal looks very good."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-04-29", "contents": "* rework versioning for architecture tracking\n* use a seperate endpoint for address resolves on mac\n* hide OTLook warnings if \"developer\" isn't set\n* defered mac renderer scanning until after mode set so 8 bit desktops don't confuse it\n* global motd/update server\n* fixed view model animations on models with custom anims\n\ntechnical note:\n\nQ3 can run networked player movement in either an asynchronous or synchronous manner. The default mode is to allow all client movement to be done asynchronously with the servers advancement of time.\n\nThe primary reason is to allow player movement to be predicted on the client side. The primary drawback is that while your movement is smooth, the other players that you see running around in the world move with a jerkiness that is relative to their framerate and network connection quality. It is NOT necessarily relative to their ping - a player on a fast system with a clean modem connection can move smoothly. If you see a player stuttering around, either they have a bad framerate, or the network connection between them and the server or you and the server is poor. The amount of stuttering is sort of the sum of the dropped or variable packets on BOTH connections.\n\nYou can force Q3 to run all clients synchronously by setting \"g_synchronousClients 1\" on the server. This will make Q3 behave similar to Q1 for networking. All movement will be lagged except view angles, which are still short-circuited immediately.\n\nSome people claim to prefer synchronous movement when everyone had a very good ping, but I don't personally think it is ever a play benefit. It makes leading players a bit easier, but I think the crisp movement control of client side prediction is a much better tradeoff.\n\nHowever, there is still a reason for using it: recorded demos come out a LOT smoother looking when running with sync.

When anisotropic viewing angles and upper level clamping are taken into account, the number gets smaller. Take 1/3 as a conservative estimate.\n\nGiven a fairly aggressive six texture passes over the entire screen, that equates to needing twice as many texels as pixels. At 1024x768 resolution, well under two million texels will be referenced, no matter what the finest level of detail is. This is the worst case, assuming completely unique texturing with no repeating. More commonly, less than one million texels are actually needed.\n\nAs anyone who has tried to run certain Quake 3 levels in high quality texture mode on an eight or sixteen meg card knows, it doesn't work out that way in practice. There is a fixable part and some more fundamental parts to the fall-over-dead-with-too-many-textures problem.\n\nThe fixable part is that almost all drivers perform pure LRU (least recently used) memory management. This works correctly as long as the total amount of textures needed for a given frame fits in the card's memory after they have been loaded. As soon as you need a tiny bit more memory than fits on the card, you fall off of a performance cliff. If you need 14 megs of textures to render a frame, and your graphics card has 12 megs available after its frame buffers, you wind up loading 14 megs of texture data over the bus every frame, instead of just the 2 megs that don't fit. Having the cpu generate 14 megs of command traffic can drop you way into the single digit frame rates on most drivers.\n\nIf an application makes reasonable effort to group rendering by texture, and there is some degree of coherence in the order of texture references between frames, much better performance can be gotten with a swapping algorithm that changes its behavior instead of going into a full thrash:\n\n[code]\nWhile ( memory allocation for new texture fails ) \n    Find the least recently used texture.\n    If the LRU texture was not needed in the previous frame,\n        Free it\n    Else\n        Free the most recently used texture that isn't bound to an active texture unit\n[/code]\n\nFreeing the MRU texture seems counterintuitive, but what it does is cause the driver to use the last bit of memory as a sort of scratchpad that gets constantly overwritten when there isn't enough space. Pure LRU plows over all the other textures that are very likely going to be needed at the beginning of the next frame, which will then plow over all the textures that were loaded on top of them.\n\nIf an application uses textures in a completely random order, any given replacement policy has the some effect..\n\nTexture priority for swapping is a non-feature. There is NO benefit to attempting to statically prioritize textures for swapping. Either a texture is going to be referenced in the next frame, or it isn't. There aren't any useful gradations in between. The only hint that would be useful would be a notice that a given texture is not going to be in the next frame, and that just doesn't come up very often or cover very many texels.\n\nWith the MRU-on-thrash texture swapping policy, things degrade gracefully as the total amount of textures increase but due to several issues, the total amount of textures calculated and swapped is far larger than the actual amount of texels referenced to draw pixels.\n\nThe primary problem is that textures are loaded as a complete unit, from the smallest mip map level all the way up to potentially a 2048 by 2048 top level image. Even if you are only seeing 16 pixels of it off in the distance, the entire 12 meg stack might need to be loaded.\n\nPacking can also cause some amount of wasted texture memory. When you want to load a two meg texture, it is likely going to require a lot more than just two megs of free texture memory, because a lot of it is going to be scattered around in 8k to 64k blocks. At the pathological limit, this can waste half your texture memory, but more reasonably it is only going to be 10% or so, and cause a few extra texture swap outs.\n\nOn a frame at a time basis, there are often significant amounts of texels even in referenced mip levels that are not seen. The back sides of characters, and large textures on floors can often have less than 50% of their texels used during a frame. This is only an issue as they are being swapped in, because they will very likely be needed within the next few frames. The result is one big hitch instead of a steady loading.\n\nThere are schemes that can help with these problems, but they have costs.\n\nPacking losses can be addressed with compaction, but that has rarely proven to be worthwhile in the history of memory management. A 128-bit graphics accelerator could compact and sort 10 megs of texture memory in about 10 msec if desired.\n\nThe problems with large textures can be solved by just not using large textures. Both packing losses, and non- referenced texels can be reduced by chopping everything up into 64x64 or 128x128 textures. This requires preprocessing, adds geometry, and requires messy overlap of the textures to avoid seaming problems.\n\nIt is possible to estimate which mip levels will actually be needed and only swap those in. An application can't calculate exactly the mip map levels that will be referenced by the hardware, because there are slight variations between chips and the slope calculation would add significant processing overhead. A conservative upper bound can be taken by looking at the minimum normal distance of any vertex referencing a given texture in a frame. This will overestimate the required textures by 2x or so and still leave a big hit when the top mip level loads for big textures, but it can allow giant cathedral style scenes to render without swapping.\n\nClever programmers can always work harder to overcome obstacles, but in this case, there is a clear hardware solution that gives better performance than anything possible with software and just makes everyone's lives easier: virtualize the card's view of its local memory.\n\nWith page tables, address fragmentation isn't an issue, and with the graphics rasterizer only causing a page load when something from that exact 4k block is needed, the mip level problems and hidden texture problems just go away. Nothing sneaky has to be done by the application or driver, you just manage page indexes.\n\nThe hardware requirements are not very heavy. You need translation lookaside buffers (TLB) on the graphics chip, the ability to automatically load the TLB from a page table set up in local memory, and the ability to move a page from AGP or PCI into graphics memory and update the page tables and reference counts. You don't even need that many TLB, because graphics access patterns don't hop all over the place like CPU access can. Even with only a single TLB for each texture bilerp unit, reloads would only account for about 1/32 of the memory access if the textures were 4k blocked. All you would really want at the upper limit would be enough TLB for each texture unit to cover the texels referenced on a typical rasterization scan line.\n\nSome programmers will say \"I don't want the system to manage the textures, I want full control!\" There are a couple responses to that. First, a page level management scheme has flexibility that you just can't get with a software only scheme, so it is a set of brand new capabilities. Second, you can still just choose to treat it as a fixed size texture buffer and manage everything yourself with updates. Third, even if it WAS slower than the craftiest possible software scheme (and I seriously doubt it), so much of development is about willingly trading theoretical efficiency for quicker, more robust development. We don't code overlays in assembly language any more..\n\nSome hardware designers will say something along the lines of \"But the graphics engine goes idle when you are pulling the page over from AGP!\" Sure, you are always better off to just have enough texture memory and never swap, and this feature wouldn't let you claim any more megapixels or megatris, but every card winds up not having enough memory at some point. Ignoring those real world cases isn't helping your customers. In any case, it goes idle a hell of a lot less than if you were loading the entire texture over the command fifo.\n\n3Dlabs is supposed to have some form of virtual memory management in the permedia 3, but I am not familiar with the details (if anyone from 3dlabs wants to send me the latest register specs, I would appreciate it!).\n\nA mouse controlled first person shooter is fairly unique in how quickly it can change the texture composition of a scene. A 180-degree snap turn can conceivably bring in a completely different set of textures on a subsequent frame. Almost all other graphics applications bring textures in at a much steadier pace.\n\nSo, given that 180-degree snap turn to a completely different and uniquely textured scene, what would be the worst case performance? An AGP 2x bus is theoretically supposed to have over 500 mb/sec of bandwidth. It doesn't get that high in practice, but linear 4k block reads would give it the best possible conditions, and even at 300 mb/sec, reloading the entire texture working set would only take 10 msec.\n\nRendering is not likely to be buffered sufficiently to overlap appreciably with page loading, and the command transport for a complex scene will take significant time by itself, so it shows that a worst case scene will often not be able to be rendered in 1/60th of a second.\n\nThis is roughly the same lower bound that you get from a chip texturing directly from AGP memory. A direct AGP texture gains the benefit of fine-grained rendering overlap, but loses the benefit of subsequent references being in faster memory (outside of small on-chip caches). A direct AGP texture engine doesn't have the higher upper bounds of a cached texture engine, though. It's best and worst case are similar (generally a good thing), but the cached system can bring several times more bandwidth to bear when it isn't forced to swap anything in.\n\nThe important point is that the lower performance bound is almost an order of magnitude faster than swapping in the textures as a unit by the driver.\n\nIf you just positively couldn't deal with the chance of that much worst case delay, some form of mip level biasing could be made to kick in, or you could try and do pre-touching, but I don't think it would ever be worth it. The worst imaginable case is acceptable, and you just won't hit that case very often.\n\nUnless a truly large number of TLB are provided, the textures would need to be blocked. The reason is that with a linear texture, a 4k page maps to only a couple scan lines on very large textures. If you are going with the grain you get great reuse, but if you go across it, you wind up referencing a new page every couple texel accesses. What is wanted is an addressing mechanism that converts a 4k page into a square area in the texture, so the page access is roughly constant for all orientations. There is also a benefit from having a 128 bit access also map to a square block of pixels, which several existing cards already do. The same interleaving-of-low-order-bits approach can just be extended a few more bits.\n\nDealing with blocked texture patterns is a hassle for a driver writer, but most graphics chips have a host blit capability that should let the chip deal with changing a linear blit into blocked writes. Application developers should never know about it, in any case.\n\nThere are some other interesting things that could be done if the page tables could trigger a cpu interrupt in addition to being automatically backed by AGP or PCI memory. Textures could be paged in directly from disk for truly huge settings, or decompressed from jpeg blocks, or even procedurally generated. Even the size limits of the AGP aperture could usefully be avoided if the driver wanted to manage each page's allocation.\n\nAside from all the basic swapping issue, there are a couple of other hardware trends that push things this way.\n\nEmbedded dram should be a driving force. It is possible to put several megs of extremely high bandwidth dram on a chip or die with a video controller, but won't be possible (for a while) to cram a 64 meg geforce in. With virtualized texturing, the major pressure on memory is drastically reduced. Even an 8mb card would be sufficient for 16 bit 1024x768 or 32 bit 800x600 gaming, no matter what the texture load.\n\nThe only thing that prevents a geometry processor based card from turning almost any set of commands in a display list into a single static dma buffer is the fact that textures may be swapped in and out, causing the register programming in the buffer to be wrong. With virtual texture addressing, a texture's address never changes, and an arbitrarily complex model can be described in a static dma buffer."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-08-23", "contents": "* cluster code\n\n- boxcontents?\n+ dump rgb lightmaps for software?\n+ alias model aspect ratios different in software and gl?\n\nshare data between cmodel and ref\ntriangulate mightsee on vis?\nmalloc all cmodel arrays?\nDONT_PRECACHE flag for player weapons?\nmake an ERR_DISCONNECT that doesn't print ERROR: ?\ndon't load entire map twice in cmodel and ref!\nshow clusterviscount for bsp time optimizations?\nserver/client communication for skin overrides"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-11-21", "contents": "* fixed not-telefragging bug\n* disabled flood protection with local clients\n* fixed headoffset and gender on some model changes\n* init cg_autoswitch cvars in cl\n* fixed clearing of vm bss on restart\n* fixed hang when looped part of song isn't found\n* fixed two NAT clients connecting to same server\n* fixed warning on random once only triggers\n* added \"g_allowVote 0\"\n* added developer background sound underrun warning\n* move sound loading before clients so low memory defer works across maps\n* changed cgame load failure to a drop"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-11-09", "contents": "* fixed spinning barrel on respawn issue\n* clear eflags before intermission\n* shutdown menu on starting a cinematic\n* mask name colors to 0-7 range\n* fixed jpeg loading alpha channel\n* try for not-nearest spawn twice instead of once\n* made unzoomed exactly identity mouse modifier\n* cl_debugmove [1/2]\n* m_filter\n* fixed time warnings\n* allow timelimits to hit with only a single player\n* filter local games with different protocol versions\n* fixed bad arg 0 after sysinfo configstring\n* removed unneeded svc_servercommand at start of command strings\n* fixed redundantly loaded level bug\n* fixed journal playback from demo build\n* removed background image from viewlog window"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1998-10-14", "contents": "It has been difficult to write .plan updates lately. Every time I start writing something, I realize that I'm not going to be able to cover it satisfactorily in the time I can spend on it. I have found that terse little comments either get misinterpreted, or I get deluged by email from people wanting me to expand upon it.\n\nI wanted to do a .plan about my evolving thoughts on code quality and lessons learned through quake and quake 2, but in the interest of actually completing an update, I decided to focus on one change that was intended to just clean things up, but had a surprising number of positive side effects.\n\nSince DOOM, our games have been defined with portability in mind. Porting to a new platform involves having a way to display output, and having the platform tell you about the various relevant inputs. There are four principle inputs to a game: keystrokes, mouse moves, network packets, and time. (If you don't consider time an input value, think about it until you do - it is an important concept)\n\nThese inputs were taken in separate places, as seemed logical at the time. A function named Sys_SendKeyEvents() was called once a frame that would rummage through whatever it needed to on a system level, and call back into game functions like Key_Event( key, down ) and IN_MouseMoved( dx, dy ). The network system dropped into system specific code to check for the arrival of packets. Calls to Sys_Milliseconds() were littered all over the code for various reasons.\n\nI felt that I had slipped a bit on the portability front with Q2 because I had been developing natively on windows NT instead of cross developing from NEXTSTEP, so I was reevaluating all of the system interfaces for Q3.\n\nI settled on combining all forms of input into a single system event queue, similar to the windows message queue. My original intention was to just rigorously define where certain functions were called and cut down the number of required system entry points, but it turned out to have much stronger benefits.\n\nWith all events coming through one point (The return values from system calls, including the filesystem contents, are \"hidden\" inputs that I make no attempt at capturing, ), it was easy to set up a journalling system that recorded everything the game received. This is very different than demo recording, which just simulates a network level connection and lets time move at its own rate. Realtime applications have a number of unique development difficulties because of the interaction of time with inputs and outputs.\n\nTransient flaw debugging. If a bug can be reproduced, it can be fixed. The nasty bugs are the ones that only happen every once in a while after playing randomly, like occasionally getting stuck on a corner. Often when you break in and investigate it, you find that something important happened the frame before the event, and you have no way of backing up. Even worse are realtime smoothness issues - was that jerk of his arm a bad animation frame, a network interpolation error, or my imagination?\n\nAccurate profiling. Using an intrusive profiler on Q2 doesn't give accurate results because of the realtime nature of the simulation. If the program is running half as fast as normal due to the instrumentation, it has to do twice as much server simulation as it would if it wasn't instrumented, which also goes slower, which compounds the problem. Aggressive instrumentation can slow it down to the point of being completely unplayable.\n\nRealistic bounds checker runs. Bounds checker is a great tool, but you just can't interact with a game built for final checking, its just waaaaay too slow. You can let a demo loop play back overnight, but that doesn't exercise any of the server or networking code.\n\nThe key point: Journaling of time along with other inputs turns a realtime application into a batch process, with all the attendant benefits for quality control and debugging. These problems, and many more, just go away. With a full input trace, you can accurately restart the session and play back to any point (conditional breakpoint on a frame number), or let a session play back at an arbitrarily degraded speed, but cover exactly the same code paths..\n\nI'm sure lots of people realize that immediately, but it only truly sunk in for me recently. In thinking back over the years, I can see myself feeling around the problem, implementing partial journaling of network packets, and included the \"fixedtime\" cvar to eliminate most timing reproducibility issues, but I never hit on the proper global solution. I had always associated journaling with turning an interactive application into a batch application, but I never considered the small modification necessary to make it applicable to a realtime application.\n\nIn fact, I was probably blinded to the obvious because of one of my very first successes: one of the important technical achievements of Commander Keen 1 was that, unlike most games of the day, it adapted its play rate based on the frame speed (remember all those old games that got unplayable when you got a faster computer?). I had just resigned myself to the non-deterministic timing of frames that resulted from adaptive simulation rates, and that probably influenced my perspective on it all the way until this project.\n\nIts nice to see a problem clearly in its entirety for the first time, and know exactly how to address it."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-08-09", "contents": "* combined bsp tools into a single vc project\n* new texture animation solution\n* make any com_error drop the loading plaque\n* tools and quake2 work with new bsp format\n\n+ combine project files of bsp tools\n+ anything translucent is automatically a detail contents\n- duplicate texinfo for animations?\n+ store out contents from trace!\n+ arbitrary visleafs mappings\n+ scanmaps option for pak file building of textures\n+ delta lightstyle controls from server\n+ max moveleafs problem\n+ make r_dowarp a server passed variable?\n+ why is hunk_begin different in software?\n\ndon't forget to set SURF_NOSUBDIV on warps and sky!\ncompress ff in visdata as well as 0?\ntrinity idea: model light haze around every emiter\ntrinity idea: allways model volumetric lights by rendering back sides\nCONTENTS_VOLUME\ndo a wavy specular water novelty\nallow arbitrary chained lightmaps on a surface?\ngame.dll controlable particles\nget rid of SURF_PLANEBACK\nplayer sounds when moving?

I was uneasy about it, but the current performance was far enough off of my targets that I didn't see any other way.\n\nAfter getting over being sick the start of the week (someone from QC must have brought me a flu present), I decided to dive in to it.\n\nAt first, I was surprised at how quickly it was going. The first day, I worked out my system calling conventions and execution environment and implemented enough opcode translations to get \"hello world\" executing.\n\nThe second day I just plowed through opcode translations, tediously generating a lot of code like this:\n\n[code]\ncase OP_NEGI:\n    EmitString( \"F7 1F\" );      // neg dword ptr [edi]\n    break;\n\ncase OP_ADD:\n    EmitString( \"8B 07\" );     // mov eax, dword ptr [edi]\n    EmitString( \"01 47 FC\" );  // add dword ptr [edi-4],eax\n    EmitString( \"83 EF 04\" );  // sub edi,4\n    break;\n\ncase OP_SUB:\n    EmitString( \"8B 07\" );     // mov eax, dword ptr [edi]\n    EmitString( \"29 47 FC\" );  // sub dword ptr [edi-4],eax\n    EmitString( \"83 EF 04\" );  // sub edi,4\n    break;\n\ncase OP_DIVI:\n    EmitString( \"8B 47 FC\" );  // mov eax,dword ptr [edi-4]\n    EmitString( \"99\" );        // cdq\n    EmitString( \"F7 3F\" );     // idiv dword ptr [edi]\n    EmitString( \"89 47 FC\" );  // mov dword ptr [edi-4],eax\n    EmitString( \"83 EF 04\" );  // sub edi,4\n    break;\n[/code]\n\n(yes, I could save a few bytes in those opcodes by moving the sub edi, but I am trying to leave the subs at the bottom and the adds at the top, in case I want to add a peephole optimizer)\n\nI was writing test programs as I went, so I thought it was still going quite well. I quit for the day with only six opcodes left to write.\n\nToday I got in, wrote the last opcodes, and started running the full cgame module.\n\nThe first problem was obvious: the loading screen graphics came up with the default image instead of the text font. I quickly found and fixed a problem with system call return values.\n\nIt was then able to get into the game, but the FOV was clamped out to 160, and it crashed when you fired your gun. That turned out to be my failure to fix the operand stack correctly in the rarely used structure copy opcode.\n\nThe next problem was a little more distressing. You could run around the level, but all the items had an X coordinate of 0. This took a little while to find, and turned out to be a twitchy case of sometimes getting an extra value on the operand stack.\n\nAt that point everything looked like it was working perfectly. I was ecstatic. I started running timedemos to see what the performance looked like. Then I ran a demo without timedemo on, and near the end of the demo it crashed. Then I found out that if you play in a level for a few minutes, it either gets an error of some kind, or crashes.\n\nI was quite unhappy about that. Debugging a non-deterministic crash in generated code. Joy.\n\nWhat I wound up eventually doing was to make gigantic log files of all system call interactions and compare the compiled code against identical runs with the interpreter. I had to tweak a few things to make the processing exactly the same between them, but it let me find where things first started to diverge. It turns out I was letting the top of my compiled code's local stack creep down a bit with each call. Let it run long enough, and it started hitting important things. If I had logged stack pointers instead of parameter values, I would have found it a whole lot quicker...\n\nNow, I am pretty confident that it is correct.\n\nThe generated code is pretty grim if you look at it, in part due to the security measures (mask and add for each load/store), and in part due to the fact that it is a straight bytecode translation:\n\n[code]\n06214DD0 83 C7 04             add         edi,4\n06214DD3 C7 07 00 4D 0A 00    mov         dword ptr [edi],0A4D00h\n06214DD9 8B 1F                mov         ebx,dword ptr [edi]\n06214DDB 81 E3 FF FF 1F 00    and         ebx,1FFFFFh\n06214DE1 8B 83 30 00 DC 05    mov         eax,dword ptr [ebx+5DC0030h]\n06214DE7 89 07                mov         dword ptr [edi],eax\n06214DE9 83 C7 04             add         edi,4\n06214DEC C7 07 2C 00 00 00    mov         dword ptr [edi],2Ch\n06214DF2 8B 07                mov         eax,dword ptr [edi]\n06214DF4 01 47 FC             add         dword ptr [edi-4],eax\n06214DF7 83 EF 04             sub         edi,4\n06214DFA 8B 1F                mov         ebx,dword ptr [edi]\n06214DFC 81 E3 FF FF 1F 00    and         ebx,1FFFFFh\n06214E02 8B 83 30 00 DC 05    mov         eax,dword ptr [ebx+5DC0030h]\n06214E08 89 07                mov         dword ptr [edi],eax\n06214E0A 8B 07                mov         eax,dword ptr [edi]\n06214E0C 29 47 FC             sub         dword ptr [edi-4],eax\n06214E0F 83 EF 04             sub         edi,4\n06214E12 83 C7 04             add         edi,4\n06214E15 C7 07 40 00 00 00    mov         dword ptr [edi],40h\n[/code]\n\nCode bulk is also up there, at about 5x the bytecode version. There is definately some savings to be had with better opcode selection, but no more than 30% or so at best.\n\nPerformance is within my tolerance now:\n\nQ3demo1 dll: 52.9\nCompiled: 50.2\nInterpreted: 43.9\n\nQ3demo2 dll: 50.1\nCompiled: 46.5\nInterpreted: 38.7\n\n\nI will probably work a bit more on performance, but that is the ballpark that it will be in. 5% speed hit in most levels, somewhat more in the big open arenas. Next week I will be getting the other modules set up for running in the virtual machine and see how their performance is.\n\nIt is a pretty cool setup - you can have some modules as dlls, some as interpreted bytecodes, and some as compiled bytecodes. We will leave the user interface interpreted to save memory.\n\nTomorrow I am going to get all the byte order issues worked out for powerPC. The interpreter doesn't even work there yet because of inline constant byte order issues. Fixing that will slow the interpreter a little more, but that shouldn't be any problem, with the performance oriented stuff being compiled.\n\nDoing the PPC compiler will be a bit messier because the tools aren't as nice, and the fact that it will involve a whole lot of Mac crash/reboot cycles before it stabilizes, but I think I know what to watch out for now.\n\nVC6 crashed on me about a dozen times in the last few days, probably due to my having show-code-bytes on in the dissassembly window, but it was still pretty damn useful through the whole process.\n\nI am curious to see how the RISC code bulk turns out. The instructions are going to be longer, but all the constants can be held in registers. Should be interesting.\n\nI don't think I am going to be in any hurry to do MIPS/ALPHA/SPARC code generators. One or two code generators and execution environments is educational, but that will be more than enough for me. If we do port to other architectures, they can still run with the interpreter or binary modules until someone else gets up the inclination to do a code generator."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-04-09", "contents": "Would anyone complain if I took out lookstrafe and keyboard look modifier?

Its just great. Good work, Nvidia.\n\nIn terms of raw speed, a 16 bit color multitexture app (like quake / quake 2) should still run a bit faster on a voodoo2, and an SLI voodoo2 should be faster for all 16 bit color rendering, but TNT has a lot of other things going for it:\n\n32 bit color and 24 bit z buffers. They cost speed, but it is usually a better quality tradeoff to go one resolution lower but with twice the color depth.\n\nMore flexible multitexture combine modes. Voodoo can use its multitexture for diffuse lightmaps, but not for the specular lightmaps we offer in QuakeArena. If you want shiny surfaces, voodoo winds up leaving half of its texturing power unused (you can still run with diffuse lightmaps for max speed).\n\nStencil buffers. There aren't any apps that use it yet, but stencil allows you to do a lot of neat tricks.\n\nMore texture memory. Even more than it seems (16 vs 8 or 12), because all of the TNT's memory can be used without restrictions. Texture swapping is the voodoo's biggest problem.\n\n3D in desktop applications.

Six months ago, that would have been on the list of the top 500 supercomputing systems in the world. I bet they weren't expecting many game companies. :)\n\nSome comparative timings (in seconds):\n\n[code]\nmips = 180 mhz R10000, 1meg secondary cache\nintel = 200 mhz ppro, 512k secondary cache\nalpha = 433 mhz 21164a, 2meg secondary cache\n\nqvis3 on cashspace:\n\ncpus    mips    intel   alpha\n----    ----    ----    ----\n   1     608     905     470\n   2     309     459\n   3     208     308\n   4     158     233\n   8      81\n  12      57\n  16      43\n[/code]\n\n(14 to 1 scalability on 16 cpus, and that's including the IO!)\n\nThe timings vary somewhat on other tools - qrad3 stresses the main memory a lot harder, and the intel system doesn't scale as well, but I have found these times to be fairly representative. Alpha is almost twice as fast as intel, and mips is in between.\n\nNone of these processors are absolutely top of the line - you can get 195 mhz r10k with 4meg L2, 300 mhz PII, and 600 mhz 21164a. Because my codes are highly scalable, we were better off buing more processors at a lower price, rather than the absolute fastest available.\n\nSome comments on the cost of speed:\n\nA 4 cpu pentium pro with plenty of memory can be had for around $20k from bargain integrators. Most of our Quake licensees have one of these.\n\nFor about $60k you can get a 4 cpu, 466 mhz alphaserver 4100. Ion Storm has one of these, and it is twice as fast as a quad intel, and a bit faster than six of our mips processors.\n\nThat level of performance is where you run into a wall in terms of cost.\n\nTo go beyond that with intel processors, you need to go to one of the \"enterprise\" systems from sequent, data general, ncr, tandem, etc. There are several 8 and 16 processor systems available, and the NUMA systems from sequent and DG theoretically scale to very large numbers of CPUS (32+). The prices are totally fucked. Up to $40k PER CPU! Absolutely stupid.\n\nThe only larger alpha systems are the 8200/8400 series from dec, which go up to 12 processors at around $30k per cpu. We almost bought an 8400 over a year ago when there was talk of being able to run NT on it.\n\nOther options are the high end sun servers (but sparc's aren't much faster than intel) and the convex/hp systems (which wasn't shipping when we purchased).\n\nWe settled on the SGI origin systems because it ran my codes well, is scalable to very large numbers of processors (128), and the cost was only about $20k per cpu. We can also add Infinite Reality graphics systems if we want to.\n\nWithin a couple years, I'm sure that someone will make a plug-in SCI board for intel systems, and you will be able to cobble together NUMA systems for under $10k a cpu, but right now the SGI is the most suitable thing for us.\n\nI have been asked a few times if Quake will ever use multiple processors. You can allways run a dedicated server on one cpu and connect to it to gain some benefit, but that's not very convenient, doesn't help much, and is useless for internet play.\n\nIt's waaaay down on the priority list, but I have a cool scheme that would let me make multiple copies of the software rendering dll and frame pipeline the renderers. Response is cut by half and the frame rate would double for two cpus, but pipelining more than a frame would be a bad idea (you would get lag on your own system).\n\nI wouldn't count on it, but some day I might take a break from serious work and hack it in.\n\nThere is no convenient way to use multiple processors with the hardware accelerated versions, except to run the server on a seperate cpu.\n\nThat will probably be an issue that needs to be addressed in the lifespan of the next generation technology. Eventually people are going to start sticking multiple cpus (or multiple thread issue systems sharing resources) on a single chip, and it will become a consumer level item.

I get asked for my opinions about this often enough that it is time I just made a public statement. So here it is, my current position as of december '96...\n\nWhile the rest of Id works on Quake 2, most of my effort is now focused on developing the next generation of game technology. This new generation of technology will be used by Id and other companies all the way through the year 2000, so there are some very important long term decisions to be made.\n\nThere are two viable contenders for low level 3D programming on win32: Direct-3D Immediate Mode, the new, designed for games API, and OpenGL, the workstation graphics API originally developed by SGI. They are both supported by microsoft, but D3D has been evangelized as the one true solution for games.\n\nI have been using OpenGL for about six months now, and I have been very impressed by the design of the API, and especially it's ease of use. A month ago, I ported quake to OpenGL. It was an extremely pleasant experience. It didn't take long, the code was clean and simple, and it gave me a great testbed to rapidly try out new research ideas.\n\nI started porting glquake to Direct-3D IM with the intent of learning the api and doing a fair comparison.\n\nWell, I have learned enough about it. I'm not going to finish the port. I have better things to do with my time.\n\nI am hoping that the vendors shipping second generation cards in the coming year can be convinced to support OpenGL. If this doesn't happen early on and there are capable cards that glquake does not run on, then I apologize, but I am taking a little stand in my little corner of the world with the hope of having some small influence on things that are going to effect us for many years to come.\n\nDirect-3D IM is a horribly broken API. It inflicts great pain and suffering on the programmers using it, without returning any significant advantages. I don't think there is ANY market segment that D3D is apropriate for, OpenGL seems to work just fine for everything from quake to softimage. There is no good technical reason for the existance of D3D.\n\nI'm sure D3D will suck less with each forthcoming version, but this is an oportunity to just bypass dragging the entire development community through the messy evolution of an ill-birthed API.\n\nBest case: Microsoft integrates OpenGL with direct-x (probably calling it Direct-GL or something), ports D3D retained mode on top of GL, and tells everyone to forget they every heard of D3D immediate mode. Programmers have one good api, vendors have one driver to write, and the world is a better place.\n\nTo elaborate a bit:\n\n\"OpenGL\" is either OpenGL 1.1 or OpenGL 1.0 with the common extensions. Raw OpenGL 1.0 has several holes in functionality.\n\n\"D3D\" is Direct-3D Immediate Mode. D3D retained mode is a seperate issue. Retained mode has very valid reasons for existance. It is a good thing to have an api that lets you just load in model files and fly around without sweating the polygon details. Retained mode is going to be used by at least ten times as many programmers as immediate mode. On the other hand, the world class applications that really step to new levels are going to be done in an immediate mode graphics API. D3D-RM doesn't even really have to be tied to D3D-IM. It could be implemented to emit OpenGL code instead.\n\nI don't particularly care about the software only implementations of either D3D or OpenGL. I haven't done serious research here, but I think D3D has a real edge, because it was originally designed for software rendering and much optimization effort has been focused there. COSMO GL is attempting to compete there, but I feel the effort is misguided. Software rasterizers will still exist to support the lowest common denominator, but soon all game development will be targeted at hardware rasterization, so that's where effort should be focused.\n\nThe primary importance of a 3D API to game developers is as an interface to the wide variety of 3D hardware that is emerging. If there was one compatable line of hardware that did what we wanted and covered 90+ percent of the target market, I wouldn't even want a 3D API for production use, I would be writing straight to the metal, just like I allways have with pure software schemes. I would still want a 3D API for research and tool development, but it wouldn't matter if it wasn't a mainstream solution.\n\nBecause I am expecting the 3D accelerator market to be fairly fragmented for the forseeable future, I need an API to write to, with individual drivers for each brand of hardware. OpenGL has been maturing in the workstation market for many years now, allways with a hardware focus. We have exisiting proof that it scales just great from a $300 permedia card all the way to a $250,000 loaded infinite reality system.\n\nAll of the game oriented PC 3D hardware basically came into existance in the last year. Because of the frantic nature of the PC world, we may be getting stuck with a first guess API and driver model which isn't all that good.\n\nThe things that matter with an API are: functionality, performance, driver coverage, and ease of use.\n\nBoth APIs cover the important functionality. There shouldn't be any real argument about that. GL supports some additional esoteric features that I am unlikely to use (or are unlikely to be supported by hardware -- same effect). D3D actually has a couple nice features that I would like to see moved to GL (specular blend at each vertex, color key transparancy, and no clipping hints), which brings up the extensions issue. GL can be extended by the driver, but because D3D imposes a layer between the driver and the API, microsoft is the only one that can extend D3D.\n\nMy conclusion about performance is that there is not going to be any significant performance difference (< 10%) between properly written OpenGL and D3D drivers for several years at least. There are some arguments that gl will scale better to very high end hardware because it doesn't need to build any intermediate structures, but you could use tiny sub cache sized execute buffers in d3d and acheive reasonably similar results (or build complex hardware just to suit D3D -- ack!). There are also arguments from the other side that the vertex pools in d3d will save work on geometry bound applications, but you can do the same thing with vertex arrays in GL.\n\nCurrently, there are more drivers avaialble for D3D than OpenGL on the consumer level boards. I hope we can change this. A serious problem is that there are no D3D conformance tests, and the documentation is very poor, so the existing drivers aren't exactly uniform in their functionality. OpenGL has an established set of conformance tests, so there is no argument about exactly how things are supposed to work. OpenGL offers two levels of drivers that can be written: mini client drivers and installable client drivers. A MCD is a simple, robust exporting of hardware rasterization capabilities. An ICD is basically a full replacement for the API that lets hardware accelerate or extend any piece of GL without any overhead.\n\nThe overriding reason why GL is so much better than D3D has to do with ease of use. GL is easy to use and fun to experiment with. D3D is not (ahem). You can make sample GL programs with a single page of code. I think D3D has managed to make the worst possible interface choice at every oportunity. COM. Expandable structs passed to functions. Execute buffers. Some of these choices were made so that the API would be able to gracefully expand in the future, but who cares about having an API that can grow if you have forced it to be painful to use now and forever after? Many things that are a single line of GL code require half a page of D3D code to allocate a structure, set a size, fill something in, call a COM routine, then extract the result.\n\nEase of use is damn important. If you can program something in half the time, you can ship earlier or explore more aproaches. A clean, readable coding interface also makes it easier to find / prevent bugs.\n\nGL's interface is procedural: You perform operations by calling gl functions to pass vertex data and specify primitives.\n\n[code]\nglBegin (GL_TRIANGLES);\nglVertex (0,0,0);\nglVertex (1,1,0);\nglVertex (2,0,0);\nglEnd ();\n[/code]\n\nD3D's interface is by execute buffers: You build a structure containing vertex data and commands, and pass the entire thing with a single call. On the surface, this apears to be an efficiency improvement for D3D, because it gets rid of a lot of procedure call overhead. In reality, it is a gigantic pain-in-the-ass.\n\n[code]\n(psuedo code, and incomplete)\nv = &buffer.vertexes[0];\nv->x = 0; v->y = 0; v->z = 0;\nv++;\nv->x = 1; v->y = 1; v->z = 0;\nv++;\nv->x = 2; v->y = 0; v->z = 0;\nc = &buffer.commands;\nc->operation = DRAW_TRIANGLE;\nc->vertexes[0] = 0;\nc->vertexes[1] = 1;\nc->vertexes[2] = 2;\nIssueExecuteBuffer (buffer);\n[/code]\n\nIf I included the complete code to actually lock, build, and issue an execute buffer here, you would think I was choosing some pathologically slanted case to make D3D look bad.\n\nYou wouldn't actually make an execute buffer with a single triangle in it, or your performance would be dreadfull. The idea is to build up a large batch of commands so that you pass lots of work to D3D with a single procedure call.\n\nA problem with that is that the optimal definition of \"large\" and \"lots\" varies depending on what hardware you are using, but instead of leaving that up to the driver, the application programmer has to know what is best for every hardware situation.\n\nYou can cover some of the messy work with macros, but that brings its own set of problems. The only way I can see to make D3D generally usable is to create your own procedural interface that buffers commands up into one or more execute buffers and flushes when needed. But why bother, when there is this other nifty procedural API allready there...\n\nWith OpenGL, you can get something working with simple, straightforward code, then if it is warranted, you can convert to display lists or vertex arrays for max performance (although the difference usually isn't that large). This is the right way of doing things -- like converting your crucial functions to assembly language after doing all your development in C.\n\nWith D3D, you have to do everything the painful way from the beginning. Like writing a complete program in assembly language, taking many times longer, missing chances for algorithmic improvements, etc. And then finding out it doesn't even go faster.\n\nI am going to be programming with a 3D API every day for many years to come. I want something that helps me, rather than gets in my way.\n\nJohn Carmack\nId Software"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-05-07", "contents": "* fixed point / point missile interactions\n* don't change weapons on pickup in deathmatch\n* made vis 30% faster\n* fixed falling in floor\n* fixed and armor plated the jump out of water code\n* fixed jump monkey climbing\n* dissalow \"kill\" when allready dead\n* all hell knight actions\n* COM_LoadStackFile\n* cache movement\n* fixed shambler pain frame\n\n+ stair climbing clipping against walls is messed up a bit\n+ monsters need to drop to floor after teleport\n+ menu01\n+ loading on stack causes errors on dos\n+ flashing disk icon\n+ make caching perfect\n+ monsters not fight each other if not seen player yet\n+ make lighting gun consume cells\n+ falling into floor bug\n+ zombie clipping\n+ cycling channel allocation\n+ no Host_Error: for valid disconnect\n+ body que isn't working\n\nshooting rockets at point blank\ndeathmatch switch to better weapon again\nlightning needs to pitch\ncontrol animating texture speed\nneed to cut the update message size\nsfx volume option\nplayer only checkbox for doors and triggers\nlaunch lightning from exact spots\nfinalize HMD interface\nrepeating grenade bounce on some slopes\njump out of water automatically when swim up to an edge, no need to jump\nnew ground explosions\nauto pitch went into look down for no reason\ngib velocity reletive to damage?"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-05-13", "contents": "* weapon cuycling command\n* trapped bug with maps without textures\n* increase key/value size in QuakeEd\n* qcc -pak option\n* \"flechettes\" to nails\n* added \"killtarget\" on all SUB_UseTargets\n* secret doors do SUB_UseTargets\n* secret door touch messages\n* cycle entity allocation\n* versioning in savegames\n* save skill in savegame\n* don't set onground when standing on another monster\n* fixed loadgame during demo bug\n* put falling crunch on voice channel so it overrides pain sound\n* fopen demos inside packfile\n* automatic ambient sounds\n\n+ bad recursive explobox?\n+ ambient sounder tents\n+ tab stats\n+ center print sequence stuff\n+ demo files in packfiles\n+ powerups\n+ underwater looping sound\n+ pass source as parm for +defs\n\ncoop start spot\ndon't accept mouse view when paused\n\"you got # shells\" for item messags\nprecache_ambient\nvisbug.map\nseperate impact from damage\ncreate pak files with search path?\ntim5 drop item on monster bug\ntexture animation speeds\nsquash to paste\ndoubled \"clearing memory\"\nparse /* */ comments in config files\nexplosion has bad colors in it\nproof of purchase\nlightning gun\ntreading water\nlooking down towards ground bug\ndeathmatch level transitions\nbetter lava balls\nis zbuffer precision maximized?\nalias subdivider used wrongly in zoomin mode\npermanently shifted view angle on restart\noptimized single channel ambient mixing\nare 0 volume sounds hanging around?\njrbase3 old bsp explosion\nauto jump out of water\ndemo file version numbers"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-04-24", "contents": "The consolidated QuakeWorld client has been working pretty well.

I am moving back on to Rage for a while, but I expect to be able to finish it up for submission to the App Store next month.\n\nWolfenstein 3D Classic was a quickie project to satisfy my curiosity and test the iPhone waters, but Doom is a more serious effort. In addition to the millions of people with fond memories of the game, there is still an active gaming / development community surrounding the original Doom, and I don't want to disappoint any of them.\n\nOne of the things I love about open sourcing the old games is that Doom has been ported to practically everything with a 32 bit processor, from toasters to supercomputers. We hear from a lot of companies that have moved the old games onto various set top boxes and PDAs, and want licenses to sell them. We generally come to some terms in the five figure range for obscure platforms, but it is always with a bit of a sigh. The game runs, and the demo playbacks look good, but there is a distinct lack of actually caring about the game play itself. Making Doom run on a new platform is only a couple days of work. Making it a really good game on a platform that doesn't have a keyboard and mouse or an excess of processing power is an honest development effort.\n\nTo my surprise, Christian was able to dig up the original high quality source material for the Doom sounds, so we have 22khz 16 bit sound effects instead of the 11khz 8 bit ones from the original game. It turns out that I can barely tell the difference, which is a sign that we made good choices way back then about catering the sounds to the output device. If we were on the fence for any resource limits, I would have considered sticking with the originals, but the current OpenAL mixer code has errors with 8 bit source buffers, so I would have had to convert to 16 bit at load time anyway, and just referencing the high quality source media actually speeds up the load times.\n\nThe music is all stored as mp3, performed on a high quality synthesizer. For Wolf, we used ogg, because that's what was in the Redux codebase that I started with, but I don't have all that CPU performance margin anymore, so it was necessary to use the iPhone's audio decompression hardware through the AudioQueue services. The music is the largest part of the application, but everything else is still well over the 10 meg cellular app transfer limit, so I'm not tempted to try and squeeze it under like we did with Wolfenstein. Maybe being able to get an app over 3G really isn't very important to its success. The fact that people are downloading Myst on the iPhone is heartening -- I have ideas for leveraging our high end idTech-5 content creation pipeline for a future iPhone game, if people will go for a few hundred meg download.\n\nThe toughest question was the artwork. Since Wolf was selling well, I had planned on paying contractors to upscale all the Doom graphics to twice the original resolution. When I pulled all the graphics out and tallied it all up, it looked a lot more marginal than I had expected. There were over two thousand individual pieces of art, and it was over ten megatexels in exactly bounded area, let alone atlas fit or power of two inset. The PVRTC compressed formats would work great for the floors and ceilings, which are all nice 64x64 blocks, but it has issues for both the walls and floors.\n\nPVRTC textures must be power of two and, notably, square. If you want a 256 x 512 texture that needs to repeat in both axis, you need to resample it to 512 x 512 to use PVRTC, which means you lose half your compression benefit and get distorted filter kernels and mip level selections. Even worse, Doom had the concept of composited walls, where a surface was generated by adding, say, a switch texture on top of a wall texture. You can't do that sort of operation with PVRTC images. The clean sheet of paper solution to both problems is to design around textures that the hardware likes and use more geometry where you need to tile or combine them, but Doom wasn't well suited to that approach.\n\nCharacter sprites don't get repeated, so a lot of them can be packed into a nice square 1024 x 1024 texture to minimize waste, but the PVRTC texture formats aren't well suited to sprite graphics. The DXT1 compression format has an exact bit mask for the alpha channel, which is what you want for an application like this. PVRTC treats alpha like any other color channel, so you get coupling between the alpha and color channels that results in partially transparent pixels ringing outside the desired character boundary. It works fine for things like clouds or fireballs, but not so good for character sprites. It looks like it should be possible to get an exact binary mask with the 2 bit PVRTC mode, which could be combined with a 4 bit PVRTC color texture to get a 6 bpp perfectly outlined sprite, but the multitexture performance on the iPhone, even with PVRTC textures, is not fast enough to prevent missing 30 fps when you have a hoard of monsters in front of you.\n\nWe started to do some internal samples of up-scaled artwork to use as reference for getting the contractor quotes, and it just wasn't looking all that spectacular. Doubling the art and smoothing out the edges wasn't buying much. There was certainly a lot of room for improvement, since Doom was designed around a 256 color palette with a limited selection of intensity ramps for lighting, but moving there from the starting point would be tricky. If I went to one of our artists today and asked them to draw a bad-ass Baron of Hell throwing a fireball in a 256 x 256 x 16 bit block, I would get something a LOT better than the original art, but it would look different, not just better.\n\nI was also a little taken aback by some of the backlash against the updated graphics that I put in for Wolf 1.1. I took the walls, guns, and decorative sprites from the Mac version of Wolfenstein, and had Eric use that as source to recreate some similar graphics that weren't present in the Mac version. After release, there were a number of reviews that complained, saying that it \"ruined the classic feel\". I have a couple thoughts abut this: Changing the look on a point release is going to cause some level of complaint, so it is probably a good idea to make any changes from \" classic\" you think you might want in version 1.0. I also believe most of the complaints were due to the view weapons. The original gun artwork wasn't great, but the double-res ones weren't very good either, and they were a bit different looking. I debated with myself a bit about using them at all, and it looks like I probably shouldn't have. I can't see any drawback whatsoever to the double res walls and sprites, since they are in the same style, just better looking when you jam your face up against them.\n\nIn the end, I decided not to do anything with the DOOM source art. With the GPU accelerated filtering and 24 bit lighting it looks a lot better than it ever did, and with floors, ceilings, and lighting you don't seem to notice the low resolution as much as with Wolf.\n\nWith the speed (a solid 30 fps, even in the more aggressive later levels), the audio, the resolution, and the rendering quality, it is Doom as you remember it, which is quite a bit better than it actually was. If you go back and play the original game on a 386 with a sound blaster, you will be surprised at the 15 fps, FM-synth music, \"bathroom tile sized\" 320 x 200 pixels, external network game setup utility, and external keyboard configuration. A lot of people remember it as \"The best game EVER!\", but \"ever\" has sure moved a lot in the last decade!\n\nBefore I actually started coding on the project, I had visions of adding a lot of modern tuned effects to the core gameplay experience. It would certainly stay a sprite-and-sector based game, but there are many things that would be done differently with the benefit of a GPU and the wisdom of hindsight. Once I began actually working on it, it started to look like a bad idea for a number of reasons. I am trying to not be very disruptive in the main codebase, because I want it to stay a part of http://prboom.sourceforge.net/ instead of being another codebase fork. While I can certainly add a bunch of new features fairly quickly, iterating through a lot of user testing and checking for problems across the >100 commercial Doom levels would take a lot longer. There really is value in \" classic\" in this case, and there would be some degree of negative backlash to almost any \"improvements\" I made. There will still be a couple tiny tweaks, but nothing radical is changing in the basic play. It would be fun to take a small team, permanently fork it, and make a \"Doom++\" just for the iPhone, but that wouldn't be the best first move. Maybe later.\n\nThe iPhone interface around the game is all done nicely. Wolf Classic got dinged a bit for the blocky look of the buttons and interface components. I didn't actually see any complaints about the crappy monospace font, but it deserved some. Everything looks good now.\n\nThe initial release will be for OS 2.x, and support multiplayer over WiFi. A later release will be for 3.x only, and support bluetooth multiplayer. I looked into the possibility of 3G multiplayer, but the latencies just aren't good enough -- I see 380 or so pings from my phone to local servers. This was interesting, because I have talked to other hardware vendors that claim 3G latencies of half that. I'm not sure if there are issues with the iPhone, issues with AT&T's network in Dallas, or if the vendor was just mistaken about what they were getting. One anecdotal report is that iPhones work better in Japan than here, so it may be infrastructure.\n\nI will probably have another update later with more technical details about the logic behind the new rendering architecture (rewritten for > 2x the speed of the original prBoom GL renderer), touch control issues, and so on.\n"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-05-12", "contents": "* catch overbackoff in movement sliding code\n* extended key/value size in utils\n* added flame alias model\n* \\n in epair text\n* fixed slope by wall false step in movement code\n* hacked around sticky corner problem\n* weapon/item flashing on inventory bar\n* fixed soundinfo exploded on a no sound card system\n* optimized snd paint and transfer\n\n+ change weapon\n+ jrstart: no fall in water by medium\n+ demo loops\n+ player stats on frag bar\n+ nail gun alternating\n+ cycle edict allocations\n+ jrstart: light up black corners\n+ clear center print when console drops\n\naxe view tilt\nbetter underwater bubble control\ntrack killer\nkick monsters off edges in pain/death\njump landing frames\nnew explosions"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-05-06", "contents": "* removed MOUSE1, MOUSE2, MOUSE3, added K_MOUSE1, etc for binding\n* check for spurious mouse buttons\n* fixed stair climbing underwater\n* trigger_onlyregistered\n* fixed door sound loopinhg problems\n* button configuration\n* made monsters stand still at point blank range\n* idle view motion\n* monsters get mad at each other on any damage\n\n+ cache movement on hunk allocs\n+ hi res modes with new code are broken\n+ dead guy still firing / pushed into floor\n+ fake pause causes problems when map from console\n+ zombie shouldn't go into pain frame when down\n+ change weapon command\n+ is DMA left enambled in sound code?\n\nrespawning of items that dropped down with a plat\nrocket points block plats\ndon't clear text on vid mode change\ngrenade bounced off ogre\nbind # option for weird controllers\nkey sticking\ninvestigate the vis problems\nmake monsters head for their spawn points after they kill the player\ncamera follow killer\ndestroy backpacks when doors close on them\nlightning gun model\nlightning gun no damage to shambler\ndoes shambler bolt hurt monsters?"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1998-12-29", "contents": "I am considering taking a shortcut with my virtual machine implementation that would make the integration a bit easier, but I'm not sure that it doesn't compromise the integrity of the base system.\n\nI am considering allowing the interpreted code to live in the global address space, instead of a private 0 based address space of its own.

Once a quarter sounds about right.\n\nI'm not ready to talk specifically about what I am working on for trinity. Quake went through many false starts (beam trees, portals, etc) before settling down on its final architecture, so I know that the odds are good that what I am doing now won't actually be used in the final product, and I don't want to mention anything that could be taken as an implied \"promise\" by some people.\n\nI'm very excited by all the prospects, though.\n\nMany game developers are in it only for the final product, and the process is just what they have to go through to get there.

I don't remember any of our older product releases, but I remember the important insights all the way back to using CRTC wraparound for infinate smooth scrolling in Keen (actually, all the way back to understanding the virtues of structures over parallel arrays in apple II assembly language..). Knowledge builds on knowledge.\n\nI wind up catagorizing periods of my life by how rich my learning experiences were at the time.\n\nMy basic skills built up during school on apple II computers, but lack of resources limited how far and fast I could go. The situation is so much better for programmers today - a cheap used PC, a linux CD, and an internet account, and you have all the tools and resources necessary to work your way to any level of programming skill you want to shoot for.\n\nMy first six months at Softdisk, working on the PC, was an incredible learning experience. For the first time, I was around a couple of programmers with more experience than I had (Romero and Lane Roath), there were a lot of books and materials available, and I could devote my full and undivided attention to programming. I had a great time.\n\nThe two years following, culminating in DOOM and the various video game console work I did, was a steady increase in skills and knowledge along several fronts - more graphics, networking, unix, compiler writing, cross development, risc architectures, etc.\n\nThe first year of Quake's development was awesome. I got to try so many new things, and I had Michael Abrash as my sounding board. It would probably surprise many classically trained graphics programmers how little I new about conventional 3D when I wrote DOOM - hell, I had problems properly clipping wall polygons (which is where all the polar coordinate nonsense came from). Quake forced me to learn things right, as well as find some new innovations.\n\nThe last six months of Quake's development was mostly pain and suffering trying to get the damn thing finished. It was all worth it in the end, but I don't look back at it all that fondly.\n\nThe development cycle of Quake 2 had some moderate learning experiences for me (glquake, quakeworld, radiosity, openGL tool programming, win32, etc), but it also gave my mind time to sift through a lot of things before getting ready to really push ahead.\n\nI think that the upcoming development cycle for trinity is going to be at least as rewarding as Quake's was. I am reaching deep levels of understanding on some topics, and I am branching out into several completely new (non-graphics) areas for me, that should cross-polinate well with everything else I am doing.\n\nThere should also be a killer game at the end of it. :)"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-11-04", "contents": "* allowed bad sky textures\n* cinematic tweaks in gl\n* high res skins\n* fixed duck speed issues\n\n+ names are messed up\n+ not disconnecting cleanly?\n+ cinematic GL wrapping problem\n+ cinematic quality issues\n+ cinematic sound\n+ cinematic end frame marker\n+ switch sound to high quality for cinematic\n+ is idlog aborting early on menu?\n+ dropping items makes them respawn in deathmatch\n+ crouch strafe is faster than forward\n+ sink in plats bug\n+ lower paused icon on screen\n+ min firing ammo for dropping weapons\n+ spawn explosions with a random yaw\n\ngun puff animations wrong?\nno status bar during intermission\nsv_showcmds\nare sky images freed properly?\nwading sound\nuse 16 to 8 table is ref_soft for tga loading?\nsavegame off pak file\ndemo file parsing from pak?\ncheck replace alpha value for mcd hack\nscreen update timer for software opengl?\ninstant items\nitem sounds\ninclude texture source size in texinfo so other scaled versions can be made?\nare cinematics using color 0?\nsend pak checksum to server?\nfix dedicated_start\nprint dm rules on connect?\nblink f1 and play sound\nskill values!\nloadgame from console\ninput based demos for profiling"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-11-10", "contents": "* qe4 bad class parse bug\n* grenade bounce generates two sounds\n* playerstate delta\n* qdata variable sound rates\n\ncheck the replace mode alpha bug\nreplace all muzzle flashes with events\nlower railgun"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-06-03", "contents": "Whee!

When I tried fixing the code so that it just didn't work, I thought it changed the normal running movement in an unfortunate way.\n\nIn the absense of powerups or level features (wind tunnels, jump pads, etc), the game characters are supposed to be badasses with big guns.

We had quite a bit of discussion about whether we should be showing anything at all, considering how far away we are from having a title on the shelves, so we probably aren't going to be showing it anywhere else for quite a while.\n\nWe do run a bit better on a high end wintel system, but the Apple performance is still quite good, especially considering the short amount of time that the drivers had before the event.\n\nIt is still our intention to have a simultaneous release of the next product on Windows, MacOS-X, and Linux.\n\nHere is a dump on the GeForce 3 that I have been seriously working with for a few weeks now:\n\nThe short answer is that the GeForce 3 is fantastic. I haven't had such an impression of raising the performance bar since the Voodoo 2 came out, and there are a ton of new features for programmers to play with.\n\nGraphics programmers should run out and get one at the earliest possible time. For consumers, it will be a tougher call. There aren't any applications our right now that take proper advantage of it, but you should still be quite a bit faster at everything than GF2, especially with anti-aliasing. Balance that against whatever the price turns out to be.\n\nWhile the Radeon is a good effort in many ways, it has enough shortfalls that I still generally call the GeForce 2 ultra the best card you can buy right now, so Nvidia is basically dethroning their own product.\n\nIt is somewhat unfortunate that it is labeled GeForce 3, because GeForce 2 was just a speed bump of GeForce, while GF3 is a major architectural change. I wish they had called the GF2 something else.\n\nThe things that are good about it:\n\nLots of values have additional internal precision, like texture coordinates and rasterization coordinates. There are only a few places where this matters, but it is nice to be cleaning up. Rasterization precision is about the last thing that the multi-thousand dollar workstation boards still do any better than the consumer cards.\n\nAdding more texture units and more register combiners is an obvious evolutionary step.\n\nAn interesting technical aside: when I first changed something I was doing with five single or dual texture passes on a GF to something that only took two quad texture passes on a GF3, I got a surprisingly modest speedup. It turned out that the texture filtering and bandwidth was the dominant factor, not the frame buffer traffic that was saved with more texture units. When I turned off anisotropic filtering and used compressed textures, the GF3 version became twice as fast.\n\nThe 8x anisotropic filtering looks really nice, but it has a 30%+ speed cost. For existing games where you have speed to burn, it is probably a nice thing to force on, but it is a bit much for me to enable on the current project. Radeon supports 16x aniso at a smaller speed cost, but not in conjunction with trilinear, and something is broken in the chip that makes the filtering jump around with triangular rasterization dependencies.\n\nThe depth buffer optimizations are similar to what the Radeon provides, giving almost everything some measure of speedup, and larger ones available in some cases with some redesign.\n\n3D textures are implemented with the full, complete generality. Radeon offers 3D textures, but without mip mapping and in a non-orthogonal manner (taking up two texture units).\n\nVertex programs are probably the most radical new feature, and, unlike most \"radical new features\", actually turn out to be pretty damn good. The instruction language is clear and obvious, with wonderful features like free arbitrary swizzle and negate on each operand, and the obvious things you want for graphics like dot product instructions.\n\nThe vertex program instructions are what SSE should have been.\n\nA complex setup for a four-texture rendering pass is way easier to understand with a vertex program than with a ton of texgen/texture matrix calls, and it lets you do things that you just couldn't do hardware accelerated at all before. Changing the model from fixed function data like normals, colors, and texcoords to generalized attributes is very important for future progress.\n\nHere, I think Microsoft and DX8 are providing a very good benefit by forcing a single vertex program interface down all the hardware vendor's throats.\n\nThis one is truly stunning: the drivers just worked for all the new features that I tried. I have tested a lot of pre-production 3D cards, and it has never been this smooth.\n\nThe things that are indifferent:\n\nI'm still not a big believer in hardware accelerated curve tessellation. I'm not going to go over all the reasons again, but I would have rather seen the features left off and ended up with a cheaper part.\n\nThe shadow map support is good to get in, but I am still unconvinced that a fully general engine can be produced with acceptable quality using shadow maps for point lights. I spent a while working with shadow buffers last year, and I couldn't get satisfactory results. I will revisit that work now that I have GeForce 3 cards, and directly compare it with my current approach.\n\nAt high triangle rates, the index bandwidth can get to be a significant thing. Other cards that allow static index buffers as well as static vertex buffers will have situations where they provide higher application speed. Still, we do get great throughput on the GF3 using vertex array range and glDrawElements.\n\nThe things that are bad about it:\n\nVertex programs aren't invariant with the fixed function geometry paths. That means that you can't mix vertex program passes with normal passes in a multipass algorithm. This is annoying, and shouldn't have happened.\n\nNow we come to the pixel shaders, where I have the most serious issues. I can just ignore this most of the time, but the way the pixel shader functionality turned out is painfully limited, and not what it should have been.\n\nDX8 tries to pretend that pixel shaders live on hardware that is a lot more general than the reality.\n\nNvidia's OpenGL extensions expose things much more the way they actually are: the existing register combiners functionality extended to eight stages with a couple tweaks, and the texture lookup engine is configurable to interact between textures in a list of specific ways.\n\nI'm sure it started out as a better design, but it apparently got cut and cut until it really looks like the old BumpEnvMap feature writ large: it does a few specific special effects that were deemed important, at the expense of a properly general solution.\n\nYes, it does full bumpy cubic environment mapping, but you still can't just do some math ops and look the result up in a texture. I was disappointed on this count with the Radeon as well, which was just slightly too hardwired to the DX BumpEnvMap capabilities to allow more general dependent texture use.\n\nEnshrining the capabilities of this mess in DX8 sucks. Other companies had potentially better approaches, but they are now forced to dumb them down to the level of the GF3 for the sake of compatibility. Hopefully we can still see some of the extra flexibility in OpenGL extensions.\n\nThe future:\n\nI think things are going to really clean up in the next couple years. All of my advocacy is focused on making sure that there will be a completely clean and flexible interface for me to target in the engine after DOOM, and I think it is going to happen.\n\nThe market may have shrunk to just ATI and Nvidia as significant players. Matrox, 3D labs, or one of the dormant companies may surprise us all, but the pace is pretty frantic.\n\nI think I would be a little more comfortable if there was a third major player competing, but I can't fault Nvidia's path to success."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-08-19", "contents": "* leaktest\n\n+ min clamp extents"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-11-19", "contents": "Linux version isn't going to make it tonight.

With the currently shipping MCD GL driver on NT, it just doesn't run well at all. The performance is well below acceptable, and there are some strange mip map selection errors. We have been hearing for quite some time that ATI is working on an OpenGL ICD for both '95 and NT, but we haven't seen it yet. The rage pro supposedly has multitexture capability, which would help out quite a bit if they implement the multitexture extension. If they do a very good driver, the rage pro may get up to the performance of the rendition cards. Supports up to 16MB, which would make it good for development work if the rest of it was up to par.\n\n\n3DLabs permedia II\n------\nGood throughput, poor fillrate, fair quality, fair features.\n\nNo colored lighting blend mode, currently no mip mapping at all.\n\nSupports up to 8MB.\n\nThe only currently shipping production full ICD for '95, but a little flaky.\n\nIf 3dlabs implemented per-polygon mip mapping, they would get both a quality and a slight fillrate boost.\n\nDrivers available for WinNT on the DEC Alpha (but the alpha drivers are very flaky).\n\n\nPower VR PCX2\n-----\nPoor throughput, good fillrate, fair quality, poor features, low price.\n\nNo WinNT support.\n\nAlmost no blend modes at all, low alpha precision.\n\nEven though the hardware doesn't support multitexture, they could implement the multi-texture extension just to save on polygon setup costs. That might get them a 10% to 15% performance boost.\n\nThey could implement the point parameters extension for a significant boost in the speed of particle rendering. That wouldn't affect benchmark scores very much, but it would help out in hectic deathmatches.\n\nTheir opengl minidriver is already a fairly heroic effort - the current PVR takes a lot of beating about the head to make it act like an OpenGL accelerator.\n\n\nRendition v2100 / v2200\n--------\nGood throughput, good fillrate, very good quality, good features.\n\nA good all around chip. Not quite voodoo1 performance, but close.\n\nv2100 is simply better than everything else in the $99 price range.\n\nCan render 24 bit color for the best possible quality, but their current drivers don't support it. Future ones probably will.\n\nCan do 3D on the desktop.\n\nRendition should be shipping a full ICD OpenGL, which will make an 8mb v2200 a very good board for people doing 3D development work.\n\n\nNVidia Riva 128\n-----\nVery good throughput, very good fillrate, fair quality, fair features.\n\nThe fastest fill rate currently shipping, but it varies quite a bit based on texture size. On large textures it is slightly slower than voodoo, but on smaller textures it is over twice as fast.\n\nOn paper, their triangle throughput rate should be three times what voodoo gives, but in practice we are only seeing a slight advantage on very fast machines, and worse performance on pentium class machines. They probably have a lot of room to improve that in their drivers.\n\nIn general, it is fair to say that riva is somewhat faster than voodoo 1, but it has a few strikes against it.\n\nThe feature implementation is not complete. They have the blend mode for colored lighting, but they still don't have them all. That may hurt them in future games. Textures can only be 1 to 1 aspect ratio. In practice, that just means that non-square textures waste memory.\n\nThe rendering quality isn't quite as high as voodoo or rendition. It looks like some of their iterators don't have enough precision.\n\nNvidia is serious and committed to OpenGL. I am confident that their driver will continue to improve in both performance and robustness.\n\nWhile they can do good 3D in a window, they are limited to a max of 4MB of framebuffer, which means that they can't run at a high enough resolution to do serious work.\n\n\n3DFX Voodoo 1\n-----\nThe benchmark against which everything else is measured.\n\nGood throughput, good fillrate, good quality, good features.\n\nIt has a couple faults, but damn few: max texture size limited to 256*256 and 8 to 1 aspect ratio. Slow texture swapping. No 24 bit rendering.\n\nBecause of the slow texture swapping, anyone buying a voodoo should get a six mb board (e.g. Canopus Pure3D). The extra ram prevents some sizable jerks when textures need to be swapped.\n\nHighly tuned minidriver. They have a full ICD in alpha, but they are being slow about moving it into production. Because of the add-in board nature of the 3dfx, the ICD won't be useful for things like running level editors, but it would at least guarantee that any new features added to quake engine games won't require revving the minidriver to add new functionality.\n\n\n3DFX Voodoo 2\n-----\nNot shipping yet, but we were given permission to talk about the benchmarks on their preproduction boards.\n\nExcellent throughput, excellent fillrate, good quality, excellent features.\n\nThe numbers were far and away the best ever recorded, and they are going to get significantly better. On quake 2, voodoo 2 is setup limited, not fill rate limited. Voodoo 2 can do triangle strip and fan setup in hardware, but their opengl can't take advantage of it until the next revision of glide. When that happens, the number of vertexes being sent to the card will drop by HALF. At 640*480, they will probably become fill rate bound again (unless you interleave two boards), but at 512*384, they will probably exceed 100 fps on a timedemo. In practice, that means that you will play the game at 60 fps with hardly ever a dropped frame.\n\nThe texture swapping rate is greatly improved, addressing the only significant problem with voodoo.\n\nI expect that for games that heavily use multitexture (all quake engine games), voodoo 2 will remain the highest performer for all of '98. All you other chip companies, feel free to prove me wrong. :)\n\nLack of 24 bit rendering is the only visual negative.\n\nAs with any voodoo solution, you also give up the ability to run 3D applications on your desktop. For pure gamers, that isn't an issue, but for hobbyists that may be interested in using 3D tools it may have some weight.\n\n\nIntel i740\n----\nGood throughput, good fillrate, good quality, good features.\n\nA very competent chip. I wish intel great success with the 740. I think that it firmly establishes the baseline that other companies (especially the ones that didn't even make this list) will be forced to come up to.\n\nVoodoo rendering quality, better than voodoo1 performance, good 3D on a desktop integration, and all textures come from AGP memory so there is no texture swapping at all.\n\nLack of 24 bit rendering is the only negative of any kind I can think of.\n\nTheir current MCD OpenGL on NT runs quake 2 pretty well. I have seen their ICD driver on '95 running quake 2, and it seems to be progressing well. The chip has the potential to outperform voodoo 1 across the board, but 3DFX has more highly tuned drivers right now, giving it a performance edge.

We felt that that 50% increase on those polygons was justified in normal play, but as people have pointed out, when you are playing with vertex lighting, that three passes stays three passes instead of collapsing to a single pass, resulting in a 300% increase on those polygons over the way it was before. Still faster than lightmap mode, but a large variance over other parts of the level.\n\nToday I wrote new code to address that, and improve on top of it.\n\nNow when r_vertexlight is on, I force every single shader to a single pass. In the cases where it isn't a simple light*texture case, I try and intelligently pick the most representative pass and do some fixups on the shader modulations.\n\nThis works our great, and brings the graphics load down to the minimum we can do with the data sets.\n\nPerformance is still going to be down a couple msec a frame due to using dynamic compilation instead of dll's for the cgame, but that is an intentional tradeoff.

(www.starlight.org)\n\nThere was a young man with Hodgkin's Lymphoma that, instead of wanting to go to Disneyland or other traditional wishes, wanted to visit Id and talk with me about programming.\n\nIt turned out that Seumas McNally was already an accomplished developer. His family company, Longbow Digital Arts (www.longbowdigitalarts.com), had been doing quite respectably selling small games directly over the internet. It bore a strong resemblance to the early shareware days of Apogee and Id.\n\nWe spent the evening talking about graphics programmer things - the relative merits of voxels and triangles, procedurally generated media, level of detail management, API and platforms.\n\nWe talked at length about the balance between technology and design, and all the pitfalls that lie in the way of shipping a modern product.\n\nWe also took a dash out in my ferrari, thinking \"this is going to be the best excuse a cop will ever hear if we get pulled over\".\n\nLongbow continued to be successful, and eventually the entire family was working full time on \"Treadmarks\", their new 3D tank game.\n\nOver email about finishing the technology in Treadmarks, Seumas once said \"I hope I can make it\". Not \"be a huge success\" or \"beat the competition\". Just \"make it\".\n\nThat is a yardstick to measure oneself by.\n\nIt is all too easy to lose your focus or give up with just the ordinary distractions and disappointments that life brings. This wasn't ordinary. Seumas had cancer. Whatever problems you may be dealing with in your life, they pale before having problems drawing your next breath.\n\nHe made it.\n\nTreadmarks started shipping a couple months ago, and was entered in the Independent Games Festival at the Game Developer's Conference this last month. It came away with the awards for technical excellence, game design, and the grand prize.\n\nI went out to dinner with the McNally family the next day, and had the opportunity to introduce Anna to them. One of the projects at Anna's new company, Fountainhead Entertainment (www.fountainheadent.com), is a documentary covering gaming, and she had been looking forward to meeting Seumas after hearing me tell his story a few times. The McNallys invited her to bring a film crew up to Canada and talk with everyone whenever she could.\n\nSeumas died the next week.\n\nI am proud to have been considered an influence in Seumas' work, and I think his story should be a good example for others.

Some information is probably going to get distorted in the spinning and retelling, so here is an info dump straight from me:\n\nQ3test, and later the full commercial Quake3: Arena, will be simultaniously released on windows, mac, and linux platforms.\n\nI think Apple is doing a lot of things right. A lot of what they are doing now is catch-up to wintel, but if they can keep it up for the next year, they may start making a really significant impact.\n\nI still can't give the mac an enthusiastic recommendation for sophisticated users right now because of the operating system issues, but they are working towards correcting that with MacOS X.\n\nThe scoop on the new G3 mac hardware:\n\nBasically, its a great system, but Apple has oversold its performance reletive to intel systems. In terms of timedemo scores, the new G3 systems should be near the head of the pack, but there will be intel systems outperforming them to some degree. The mac has not instantly become a \"better\" platform for games than wintel, it has just made a giant leap from the back of the pack to near the front.\n\nI wish Apple would stop quoting \"Bytemarks\". I need to actually look at the contents of that benchmark and see how it can be so misleading. It is pretty funny listening to mac evangelist types try to say that an iMac is faster than a pentium II-400. Nope. Not even close.\n\nFrom all of my tests and experiments, the new mac systems are basically as fast as the latest pentium II systems for general cpu and memory performance. This is plenty good, but it doesn't make the intel processors look like slugs.\n\nSure, an in-cache, single precision, multiply-accumulate loop could run twice as fast as a pentium II of the same clock rate, but conversly, a double precision add loop would run twice as fast on the pentium II.\n\nSpec95 is a set of valid benchmarks in my opinion, and I doubt the PPC systems significantly (if at all) outperform the intel systems.\n\nThe IO system gets mixed marks. The 66 mhz video slot is a good step up from 33 mhz pci in previous products, but that's still half the bandwidth of AGP 2X, and it can't texture from main memory. This will have a small effect on 3D gaming, but not enough to push it out of its class.\n\nThe 64 bit pci slots are a good thing for network and storage cards, but the memory controller doesn't come close to getting peak utilization out of it. Better than normal pci, though.\n\nThe video card is almost exactly what you will be able to get on the pc side: a 16 mb rage-128. Running on a 66mhz pci bus, it's theoretical peak performance will be midway between the pci and agp models on pc systems for command traffic limited scenes. Note that current games are not actually command traffic limited, so the effect will be significantly smaller. The fill rates will be identical.\n\nThe early systems are running the card at 75 mhz, which does put it at a slight disadvantage to the TNT, but faster versions are expected later. As far as I can tell, the rage-128 is as perfect as the TNT feature-wise. The 32 mb option is a feature ATI can hold over TNT.\n\nFirewire is cool.\n\nIts a simple thing, but the aspect of the new G3 systems that struck me the most was the new case design. Not the flashy plastic exterior, but the functional structure of it. The side of the system just pops open, even with the power on, and lays the motherboard and cards down flat while the disks and power supply stay in the encloser. It really is a great design, and the benefits were driven home yesterday when I had to scavenge some ram out of old wintel systems yesterday - most case designs suck really bad.\n\n-\n\nI could gripe a bit about the story of our (lack of) involvement with Apple over the last four years or so, but I'm calling that water under the bridge now.\n\nAfter all the past fiascos, I had been basically planning on ignoring Apple until MacOS X (rhapsody) shipped, which would then turn it into a platform that I was actually interested in.\n\nRecently, Apple made a strategic corporate decision that games were a fundamental part of a consumer oriented product line (duh). To help that out, Apple began an evaluation of what it needed to do to help game developers.\n\nMy first thought was \"throw out MacOS\", but they are already in the process of doing that, and its just not going to be completed overnight.\n\nApple has decent APIs for 2D graphics, input, sound, and networking, but they didn't have a solid 3D graphics strategy.\n\nRave was sort of ok. Underspecified and with no growth path, but sort of ok. Pursuing a proprietary api that wasn't competetive with other offerings would have been a Very Bad Idea. They could have tried to make it better, or even invent a brand new api, but Apple doesn't have much credebility in 3D programming.\n\nFor a while, it was looking like Apple might do something stupid, like license DirectX from microsoft and be put into a guaranteed trailing edge position behind wintel.\n\nOpenGL was an obvious direction, but there were significant issues with the licensing and implementation that would need to be resolved.\n\nI spent a day at apple with the various engineering teams and executives, laying out all the issues.\n\nThe first meeting didn't seem like it went all that well, and there wasn't a clear direction visible for the next two months. Finally, I got the all clear signal that OpenGL was a go and that apple would be getting both the sgi codebase and the conix codebease and team (the best possible arrangement).\n\nSo, I got a mac and started developing on it. My first weekend of effort had QuakeArena limping along while held together with duct tape, but weekend number two had it properly playable, and weekend number three had it brought up to full feature compatability. I still need to do some platform specific things with odd configurations like multi monitor and addon controlers, but basically now its just a matter of compiling on the mac to bring it up to date.\n\nThis was important to me, because I felt that Quake2 had slipped a bit in portability because it had been natively developed on windows. I like the discipline of simultanious portable development.\n\nAfter 150 hours or so of concentrated mac development, I learned a lot about the platform.\n\nCodeWarrior is pretty good. I was comfortable devloping there almost immediately. I would definately say VC++ 6.0 is a more powerful overall tool, but CW has some nice little aspects that I like. I am definately looking forward to CW for linux. Unix purists may be aghast, but I have allways liked gui dev environments more than a bunch of xterms running vi and gdb.\n\nThe hardware (even the previous generation stuff) is pretty good.\n\nThe OpenGL performance is pretty good. There is a lot of work underway to bring the OpenGL performance to the head of the pack, but the existing stuff works fine for development.\n\nThe low level operating systems SUCKS SO BAD it is hard to believe.\n\nThe first order problem is lack of memory management / protection.\n\nIt took me a while to figure out that the zen of mac development is \"be at peace while rebooting\". I rebooted my mac system more times the first weekend than I have rebooted all the WinNT systems I have ever owned. True, it has gotten better now that I know my way around a bit more, and the codebase is fully stable, but there is just no excuse for an operating system in this day and age to act like it doesn't have access to memory protection.\n\nThe first thing that bit me was the static memory allocation for the program. Modern operating systems just figure out how much memory you need, but because the mac was originally designed for systems without memory management, significant things have to be laid out ahead of time.\n\nPorting a win32 game to the mac will probably involve more work dealing with memory than any other aspect. Graphics, sound, and networking have reasonable analogues, but you just can't rely on being able to malloc() whatever you want on the mac.\n\nSure, game developers can manage their own memory, but an operating system that has proper virtual memory will let you develop a lot faster.\n\nThe lack of memory protection is the worst aspect of mac development. You can just merrily write all over other programs, the development environment, and the operating system from any application.\n\nI remember that. From dos 3.3 in 1990.\n\nGuard pages will help catch simple overruns, but it won't do anything for all sorts of other problems.\n\nThe second order problem is lack of preemptive multitasking.\n\nThe general responsiveness while working with multiple apps is significantly worse than windows, and you often run into completely modal dialogs that don't let you do anything else at all.\n\nA third order problem is that a lot of the interfaces are fairly clunky.\n\nThere are still many aspects of the mac that clearly show design decisions based on a 128k 68000 based machine. Wintel has grown a lot more than the mac platform did. It may have been because the intel architecture didn't evolve gracefully and that forced the software to reevaluate itself more fully, or it may just be that microsoft pushed harder.\n\nCarbon sanitizes the worst of the crap, but it doesn't turn it into anything particularly good looking.\n\nMacOS X nails all these problems, but thats still a ways away.\n\nI did figure one thing out - I was always a little curious why the early BeOS advocates were so enthusiastic. Coming from a NEXTSTEP background, BeOS looked to me like a fairly interesting little system, but nothing special. To a mac developer, it must have looked like the promised land.."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1998-05-17", "contents": "Here is an example of some bad programming in quake:\n\nThere are three places where text input is handled in the game: the console, the chat line, and the menu fields.

There were two main factors involved in my not doing updates for a long time - a good chunk of my time and interest was sucked into Armadillo Aerospace, and the fact that the work I had been doing at Id for the last half of Doom 3 development was basically pretty damn boring.\n\nThe Armadillo work has been very rewarding from a learning-lots-of-new-stuff perspective, and I'm still committed to the vehicle development, even post X-Prize, but the work at Id is back to a high level of interest now that we are working on a new game with new technology.

True, being public under the GPL isn't the same as having a royalty free license without the need to disclose the source, but I'm pretty sure there would be some hard feelings.\n\n Previous source code releases were held up until the last commercial license of the technology shipped, but with the evolving nature of game engines today, it is a lot less clear. There are still bits of early Quake code in Half Life 2, and the remaining licensees of Q3 technology intend to continue their internal developments along similar lines, so there probably won't be nearly as sharp a cutoff as before. I am still committed to making as much source public as I can, and I won't wait until the titles from the latest deal have actually shipped, but it is still going to be a little while before I feel comfortable doing the release.\n\n   Random Graphics Thoughts\n\nYears ago, when I first heard about the inclusion of derivative instructions in fragment programs, I couldn't think of anything off hand that I wanted them for. As I start working on a new generation of rendering code, uses for them come up a lot more often than I expected.\n\n I can't actually use them in our production code because it is an Nvidia-only feature at the moment, but it is convenient to do experimental code with the nv_fragment_program extension before figuring out various ways to build funny texture mip maps so that the built in texture filtering hardware calculates a value somewhat like the derivative I wanted.\n\n If you are basically just looking for plane information, as you would for modifying things with texture magnification or stretching shadow buffer filter kernels, the derivatives work out pretty well. However, if you are looking at a derived value, like a normal read from a texture, the results are almost useless because of the way they are calculated. In an ideal world, all of the samples to be differenced would be calculated at once, then the derivatives calculated from there, but the hardware only calculates 2x2 blocks at a time. Each of the four pixels in the block is given the same derivative, and there is no influence from neighboring pixels. This gives derivative information that is basically half the resolution of the screen and sort of point sampled. You can often see this effect with bump mapped environment mapping into a mip-mapped cube map, where the texture LOD changes discretely along the 2x2 blocks. Explicitly coloring based on the derivatives of a normal map really shows how nasty the calculated value is.\n\n Speaking of bump mapped environment sampling.. I spent a little while tracking down a highlight that I thought was misplaced. In retrospect it is obvious, but I never considered the artifact before: With a bump mapped surface, some of the on-screen normals will actually be facing away from the viewer. This causes minor problems with lighting, but when you are making a reflection vector from it, the vector starts reflecting into the opposite hemisphere, resulting in some sky-looking pixels near bottom edges on the model. Clamping the surface normal to not face away isn't a good solution, because you get areas that \"see right through\" to the environment map, because a reflection past a clamped perpendicular vector doesn't change the viewing vector. I could probably ramp things based on the geometric normal somewhat, and possibly pre-calculate some data into the normal maps, but I decided it wasn't a significant enough issue to be worth any more development effort or speed hit.\n\n Speaking of cube maps.. The edge filtering on cube maps is showing up as an issue for some algorithms. The hardware basically picks a face, then treats it just like a 2D texture. This is fine in the middle of the texture, but at the edges (which are a larger and larger fraction as size decreases) the filter kernel just clamps instead of being able to sample the neighbors in an adjacent cube face. This is generally a non-issue for classic environment mapping, but when you start using cube map lookups with explicit LOD bias inputs (say, to simulate variable specular powers into an environment map) you can wind up with a surface covered with six constant color patches instead of the smoothly filtered coloration you want. The classic solution would be to implement border texels, but that is pretty nasty for the hardware and API, and would require either the application or the driver to actually copy the border texels from all the other faces. Last I heard, upcoming hardware was going to start actually fetching from the other side textures directly. A second-tier chip company claimed to do this correctly a while ago, but I never actually tested it.\n\n Topics continue to chain together, I'll probably write some more next week."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1998-02-09", "contents": "Just got back from the Q2 wrap party in vegas that Activision threw for us.\n\nHaving a reasonable grounding in statistics and probability and no belief in luck, fate, karma, or god(s), the only casino game that interests me is blackjack.\n\nPlaying blackjack properly is a test of personal discipline.

The issue is complicated because of the different ways the cards can choose to run the game.\n\nThe R300 can run Doom in three different modes: ARB (minimum extensions, no specular highlights, no vertex programs), R200 (full featured, almost always single pass interaction rendering), ARB2 (floating point fragment shaders, minor quality improvements, always single pass).\n\nThe NV30 can run DOOM in five different modes: ARB, NV10 (full featured, five rendering passes, no vertex programs), NV20 (full featured, two or three rendering passes), NV30 ( full featured, single pass), and ARB2.\n\nThe R200 path has a slight speed advantage over the ARB2 path on the R300, but only by a small margin, so it defaults to using the ARB2 path for the quality improvements.  The NV30 runs the ARB2 path MUCH slower than the NV30 path. Half the speed at the moment.  This is unfortunate, because when you do an exact, apples-to-apples comparison using exactly the same API, the R300 looks twice as fast, but when you use the vendor-specific paths, the NV30 wins.\n\nThe reason for this is that ATI does everything at high precision all the time, while Nvidia internally supports three different precisions with different performances.  To make it even more complicated, the exact precision that ATI uses is in between the floating point precisions offered by Nvidia, so when Nvidia runs fragment programs, they are at a higher precision than ATI's, which is some justification for the slower speed.  Nvidia assures me that there is a lot of room for improving the fragment program performance with improved driver compiler technology.\n\nThe current NV30 cards do have some other disadvantages:  They take up two slots, and when the cooling fan fires up they are VERY LOUD.  I'm not usually one to care about fan noise, but the NV30 does annoy me.\n\nI am using an NV30 in my primary work system now, largely so I can test more of the rendering paths on one system, and because I feel Nvidia still has somewhat better driver quality (ATI continues to improve, though).  For a typical consumer, I don't think the decision is at all clear cut at the moment.\n\nFor developers doing forward looking work, there is a different tradeoff - the NV30 runs fragment programs much slower, but it has a huge maximum instruction count.  I have bumped into program limits on the R300 already.\n\nAs always, better cards are coming soon.\n\n-----\n\nDoom has dropped support for vendor-specific vertex programs (NV_vertex_program and EXT_vertex_shader), in favor of using ARB_vertex_program for all rendering paths.  This has been a pleasant thing to do, and both ATI and Nvidia supported the move.  The standardization process for ARB_vertex_program was pretty drawn out and arduous, but in the end, it is a just-plain-better API than either of the vendor specific ones that it replaced.  I fretted for a while over whether I should leave in support for the older APIs for broader driver compatibility, but the final decision was that we are going to require a modern driver for the game to run in the advanced modes.  Older drivers can still fall back to either the ARB or NV10 paths.\n\nThe newly-ratified ARB_vertex_buffer_object extension will probably let me do the same thing for NV_vertex_array_range and ATI_vertex_array_object.\n\nReasonable arguments can be made for and against the OpenGL or Direct-X style of API evolution.  With vendor extensions, you get immediate access to new functionality, but then there is often a period of squabbling about exact feature support from different vendors before an industry standard settles down.  With central planning, you can have \"phasing problems\" between hardware and software releases, and there is a real danger of bad decisions hampering the entire industry, but enforced commonality does make life easier for developers.  Trying to keep boneheaded-ideas-that-will-haunt-us-for-years out of Direct-X is the primary reason I have been attending the Windows Graphics Summit for the past three years, even though I still code for OpenGL.\n\nThe most significant functionality in the new crop of cards is the truly flexible fragment programming, as exposed with ARB_fragment_program.  Moving from the \"switches and dials\" style of discrete functional graphics programming to generally flexible programming with indirection and high precision is what is going to enable the next major step in graphics engines.\n\nIt is going to require fairly deep, non-backwards-compatible modifications to an engine to take real advantage of the new features, but working with ARB_fragment_program is really a lot of fun, so I have added a few little tweaks to the current codebase on the ARB2 path:\n\nHigh dynamic color ranges are supported internally, rather than with post-blending.  This gives a few more bits of color precision in the final image, but it isn't something that you really notice.\n\nPer-pixel environment mapping, rather than per-vertex.  This fixes a pet-peeve of mine, which is large panes of environment mapped glass that aren't tessellated enough, giving that awful warping-around-the-triangulation effect as you move past them.\n\nLight and view vectors normalized with math, rather than a cube map.  On future hardware this will likely be a performance improvement due to the decrease in bandwidth, but current hardware has the computation and bandwidth balanced such that it is pretty much a wash.  What it does (in conjunction with floating point math) give you is a perfectly smooth specular highlight, instead of the pixelish blob that we get on older generations of cards.\n\nThere are some more things I am playing around with, that will probably remain in the engine as novelties, but not supported features:\n\nPer-pixel reflection vector calculations for specular, instead of an interpolated half-angle.  The only remaining effect that has any visual dependency on the underlying geometry is the shape of the specular highlight. Ideally, you want the same final image for a surface regardless of if it is two giant triangles, or a mesh of 1024 triangles.  This will not be true if any calculation done at a vertex involves anything other than linear math operations.  The specular half-angle calculation involves normalizations, so the interpolation across triangles on a surface will be dependent on exactly where the vertexes are located.  The most visible end result of this is that on large, flat, shiny surfaces where you expect a clean highlight circle moving across it, you wind up with a highlight that distorts into an L shape around the triangulation line.\n\nThe extra instructions to implement this did have a noticeable performance hit, and I was a little surprised to see that the highlights not only stabilized in shape, but also sharpened up quite a bit, changing the scene more than I expected.  This probably isn't a good tradeoff today for a gamer, but it is nice for any kind of high-fidelity rendering.\n\nRenormalization of surface normal map samples makes significant quality improvements in magnified textures, turning tight, blurred corners into shiny, smooth pockets, but it introduces a huge amount of aliasing on minimized textures.  Blending between the cases is possible with fragment programs, but the performance overhead does start piling up, and it may require stashing some information in the normal map alpha channel that varies with mip level. Doing good filtering of a specularly lit normal map texture is a fairly interesting problem, with lots of subtle issues.\n\nBump mapped ambient lighting will give much better looking outdoor and well-lit scenes.  This only became possible with dependent texture reads, and it requires new designer and tool-chain support to implement well, so it isn't easy to test globally with the current Doom datasets, but isolated demos are promising.\n\nThe future is in floating point framebuffers.  One of the most noticeable thing this will get you without fundamental algorithm changes is the ability to use a correct display gamma ramp without destroying the dark color precision.  Unfortunately, using a floating point framebuffer on the current generation of cards is pretty difficult, because no blending operations are supported, and the primary thing we need to do is add light contributions together in the framebuffer.  The workaround is to copy the part of the framebuffer you are going to reference to a texture, and have your fragment program explicitly add that texture, instead of having the separate blend unit do it.  This is intrusive enough that I probably won't hack up the current codebase, instead playing around on a forked version.\n\nFloating point framebuffers and complex fragment shaders will also allow much better volumetric effects, like volumetric illumination of fogged areas with shadows and additive/subtractive eddy currents.\n\nJohn Carmack"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-12-13", "contents": "I need to clear up a little bit of really flagrant misinformation here:\n\nDigital Sight and Sound, a dallas based system integrator, run a little blurb in their customer update newsletter that seriously misrepresents my experiences with intergraph and sgi hardware.\n\nThe title was \"Z-13 versus sgi maximum impact, Z-13 wins\" and it included statements like \"After two weeks of grueling tests, the z-13 finished 2.5 times faster overall than the Maximum IMPCT... and at less than 1/2 the price!!!\". This just isn't true, in saveral ways.\n\nThe last time I did side by side system testing involving SGI was pitting an SGI high impact against a intergraph GLZ1T. For heavy texture mapping applications like I was doing, the SGI high impact was three times faster than the intergraph. A realizm-13t is 2.5 times faster than the older GLZ1T, but a max impact is twice as fast as a high impact, so intergraph's best is still only half the speed of sgi's best workstation.\n\nFor the record, here is my impression of the 3D hardware I have worked with, unedited. Prices are for configurations as we would use them, not minimum.\n\nRendition Verite: ($150) It won't set any speed records, but it is an excellent value, the quake port is pretty good, and the risc architecture allows a lot of room for optimization.\n\n3DFX: ($300) The highest textured fill rate of anything short of high end SGI hardware. 50 mpix, almost irrespective of options. You can't run a desktop or high res display on it, but at 640*480 it will stomp any other consumer level board, given equal optimization effort.\n\n3dlabs permedia: ($300) Right now, this is the only well supported low end open GL card. and a good all around video card. The visual quality is hurt over most other 3d boards because the internal paths apear to be 15 bits, so you don't get dithered 24 bit color out of your blending operations. The fill rate is very sensitive to what options (z buffer, blending, color depth, etc) you have turned on. It peaks at over 40 mpix, but that is with no zbuffering and 4 bit textures. Realistic cases (16 bit textures, z buffering, perspective, bilinear) bring you down to around 10 mpix. There are some performance hangups in the drivers for heavy texturing applications, but 3dlabs is working on improving them.\n\nThe remaining boards are pretty much for professional use, not gaming.\n\nDynamic Pictures Oxygen: ($1500) I can't reccomend this to anyone doing texture mapping. It was slow and had rasterization errors.\n\n3dlabs glint-TX: ($1000 - $3000) A reletively low fill rate (15 mpix peak, often a bit lower), but fairly stable in performance. Good GL drivers. Capable of supporting very high resolutions and amounts of texture memory. Available from several vendors at various (professional) price points.\n\nIntergraph intense-3d: ($2000 - $5000). The fill rate still isn't very good (15 mpix), but it hardly cares when you turn on trilinear and blending. They rape you on the texture memory prices. I have gotten better performance (but not tons better) out of this than any glint card I have tested, but I have yet to use one of the dual TX boards. They are also incompatable with a lot of motherboards.\n\nIntergraph realizm: ($7000 - $12000) The best graphics card you can buy for NT. As far as I know, you can't even get these seperately, you have to buy them as part of an intergraph system. The systems we use list around $30k each. The fill rate is 33 mpix, and very insensitive to options. You can add an optional geometry board to get very high transform/light throughput. DEC resells these as their Powerstorm T series cards for alpha systems.\n\nSGI O2: ($10000, full system) The fill rate was better than intergraph's high end, but the triangle throughput was lower. I expect SGI will be able to optimize the porformance more in the coming months. It's not a knock-your-socks-off performer, but a real, fully configured system costs less than just the video option on a high end intergraph.\n\nSGI IMPACT: ($25000 - $50000, full system) excellent fill rate and geometry rate. A very balanced, high performace system. The texture memories are very small (one or four megs), so it would probably be possible to contruct a pathalogical case that probably puts an intergraph ahead of it, but you would have to stretch. The prices are higher than intergraph, but only by about 30%.\n\nSGI Infinite reality: ($100000+) Fill rate from hell. Polygons from hell. If you don't trip up on state changes, nothing will come within shouting distance of this system. You would expect that.\n\nOur decision to go intergraph/NT over SGI/IRIX had a lot more to do with the NT vs IRIX part of it. I wish I could buy SGI hardware for NT. The last two SGI systems I did serious work on were messes of instability, but the O2 we just got last week does actually seem stable.\n\nAs far as the \"which video card should I buy?\" question from gamers, I'm afraid I can't give you a definitive answer. All of the first generation boards have some problem or another. The second generation, coming out within the next six months or so, will be more solidly positive."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1998-12-30", "contents": "I got several vague comments about being able to read \"stuff\" from shared memory, but no concrete examples of security problems.\n\nHowever, Gregory Maxwell pointed out that it wouldn't work cross platform with 64 bit pointer environments like linux alpha.

It still hasn't arrived (bad impression), but SGI did bring a loaner system by for us to work with.\n\nThe system tower is better than standard pc fare, but I still think Apple's new G3 has the best designed computer case.\n\nThe wide aspect LCD panel is very nice. A while ago I had been using a dual monitor LCD setup on a previous intergraph, but the analog syncing LCD screens had some fringing problems, and the gamma range was fairly different from a CRT. The SGI display is perfectly crisp (digital interface), and has great color. The lighting is a little bit uneven top to bottom on this unit -- I am interested to see how the next unit looks for comparison.\n\nUnfortunately, the card that they bundle with the LCD if you buy it separately is NOT a good 3D accelerator, so if you care about 3D and want this LCD screen, you need to buy an sgi visual workstation. Several of the next generation consumer cards are going to support digital flat panel outputs, so hopefully soon you will be able to run a TNT2 or something out to one of these.\n\nThe super memory system does not appear to have provided ANY benefit to the CPU. My memory benchmarking tests showed it running about the same as a standard intel design.\n\nOur first graphics testing looked very grim -- Quake3 didn't draw the world at all. I spent a while trying to coax some output by disabling various things, but to no avail. We reported it to SGI, and they got us a fix the next day. Some bug with depthRange(). Even with the fix, 16 bit rendering doesn't seem to work. I expect they will address this.\n\nOther than that, there haven't been any driver anomolies, and both the game and editor run flawlessly.\n\nFor single pass, top quality rendering (32 bit framebuffer, 32 bit depth buffer, 32 bit trilinear textures, high res screen), the SGI has a higher fill rate than any other card we have ever tested on a pc, but not by too wide of a margin.\n\nIf your application can take advantage of multitexture, a TNT or rage128 will deliver slightly greater fill performance. It is likely that the next speed bump of both chips will be just plain faster than the SGI on all fill modes.\n\nA serious flaw is that the LCD display can't support ANY other resolutions except the native 1600*1024. The game chunks along at ten to fifteen fps at that resolution (but it looks cool!). They desperately need to support a pixel doubled 800*512 mode to make any kind of full screen work possible. I expect they will address this.\n\nVsync disable is implemented wrong. Disabling sync causes it to continue rendering, but the flip still doesn't happen until the next frame. This gives repeatable (and faster) benchmark numbers, but with a flashing screen that is unusable. The right way is to just cause the flip to happen on the next scan line, like several consumer cards do, or blit. It gives tearing artifacts, but it is still completely usable, and avoids temporal nyquist issues between 30 and 60 hz. I expect they will address this.\n\nTotal throughput for games is only fair, about like an intergraph. Any of the fast consumer cards will run a quake engine game faster than the sgi in its current form. I'm sure some effort will be made to improve this, but I doubt it will be a serious focus, unless some SGI engineers develop unhealthy quake addictions. :-)\n\nThe unified memory system allows nearly a gig of textures, and individual textures can by up to 4k by 4k. AGP texturing provides some of this benefit for consumer cards, but not to the same degree or level of performance.\n\nThe video stream support looks good, but I haven't tried using it yet.\n\nVery high interpolater accuracy. All the consumer cards start to break up a bit with high magnification, weird aspects, or long edges. The professional cards (intergraph, glint, E&S, SGI) still do a better job.\n\nSGI exports quite a few more useful OpenGL extensions than intergraph does, but multisample antialiasing (as claimed in their literature) doesn't seem to be one of them.\n\nOverall, it looks pretty good, and I am probably going to move over to using the SGI workstation full time when my real system arrives.\n\nI was very happy with the previous two generations of intergraph workstations, but this last batch (GT1) has been a bunch of lemons, and the wildcat graphics has been delayed too long. The current realizm-II systems just don't have enough fill rate for high end development.\n\nFor developers that don't have tons of money, the decision right now is an absolute no-brainer -- buy a TNT and stick it in a cheap system.

Stuff like that.\"\n\nI have the awesome example now: Lighting.\n\nThrough the entire development of Q3, I have been wanting to do dynamic lighting of the world differently. Many of the efficiencies gained by Q3's new map format result in larger and larger lightmaps while it reduces polygon count. That meant that even small dynamic lights may force a lot of work to generate new lighting textures.\n\nI had been wanting to find a way to trade off additional rendering passes for less CPU time.\n\nThis is a perfect example of me outthinking myself.\n\nI knew it would have to be something with projecting a light spot texture onto the world geometry, but I am keenly enough aware of the issues and limitations in projecting a 2D texture onto 3D geometry that my mind kept looking at worst case scenarios -- how do you project a continuous texture onto the inside of a dome with the proper intensities, and some situations with curves. I thought it would require some non-trivial per triangle analysis and operations, when I really just wanted something that could be done on a per-vertex level.\n\nRecently, the 3D texture insight hit me.\n\nCreate a 3D texture of, say, 32*32*32 texels and fill it with your light attenuation function, bright point in the center, fading off to black at the edge. Set it to clamp mode, so any values beyond the edges stay black. Set up a texture coordinate generation matrix to position the light relative to your models. Its a simple translate and scale. Set up lighting calculation to only generate a value based on the relative angles, ignoring attenuation. Use the resulting modulated texture mapping as your \"lightmap\" to modulate another texture pass, or add to a previous lighting pass.\n\nThis has several important benefits:\n\nIt looks good (and identical) on both small and large polygons. Vertex based lighting needs an appalling amount of tessellation to avoid visibly triangulation artifacts. Even if you tessellate to the same sample density as your lightmap grid (hundreds of thousands per map), vertex lighting still looks worse, because it is a triangular instead of bilinear interpolation.\n\nIt can be done completely by upcoming lighting and texgen hardware, but is efficient in software implementations.\n\nIt can be shadowed by either stencil volume shadows or shadow buffer tests.\n\nPost Q3A, I plan on doing a research engine that is fully dynamically lit and shadowed instead of using lightmaps.\n\nOk, but we don't have 3D textures in any hardware now, so this doesn't help me for Q3A.\n\nI continued thinking along complex lines, like \"Any planar slice of a spherical 3D texture will be a 2D circle, and the three triangle points can occupy any location on their respective rings\".\n\nIt still looked like a big mess.\n\nI got tired of thinking about it, and just started coding in some infrastructure to do extra lighting passes. I just made a gradient circle texture for the lighting, and generated the texture coordinates by just translating and scaling X and Y from the world coordinates.\n\nI got it running, grabbed a rocket launcher, and fired down a hallway. It looked just fine. I was stunned. I had been thinking about complex ramifications of weird edge cases for the past year when all it took was a couple hours of programming and the simplest possible approach to make it work decent. Sigh. :-)\n\nThe only real addition required was a fading of the light contribution with Z distance from the surface. The downside to this hack is that while you get a nice ball of light moving over floors and ceilings, you only get a wash of light on walls. In hindsight, I can analyze this in the context of our games and say \"Almost all movement and targeting takes place in the XY plane in a FPS, so accuracy along the Z axis is not necessary.\"\n\nThe somewhat more obvious change to dynamic lighting that wasn't related to the projection issue is that I have it currently set up as a postprocess pass, rather than an additive pass on the lightmap. Adding to the lightmap is more \"right\", but it really complicates the multitexture implementation, and on some surfaces, the lightmap is actually done after the base texture, so it couldn't be added to. The end result is that brighter areas are changed more by dlights than dark areas. I don't feel TOO bad about that, because its not like the dlight is much of a proper lighting simulation even in the best case...\n\n\n\n* fixed tourney restart\n* fixed jittering on plats\n* fixed ref use without a world\n* new default image that lets you see mapping coordinates\n* fixed reliable sequences on restarts and demos\n* allow maxclients to change between levels\n* randomize shell ejection start position and angles\n* display attackers head after every wound\n* added gamma and overbright support to mac version\n* removed table from sound mixing\n* remove smoke and blood puffs when you run through them\n* set cheats to 1 on disconnect\n* shader sort value is now floating point\n* new trajectory type \"TR_INTERPOLATE\", skip interpoaltion for other types\n* fixed door open timing\n* fixed bug with >8 portal areas\n* added area print to r_shwocluster\n* removed all the partial shader match cruft, fixing a crash-on-load\n* fixed bug with personal shadows not being setup properly\n* nomipmap shader parm split and expanded:\nnopicmip : ignores r_picmip so image will always be high res\nnomipmap : forces a single level texture, used for console font\n* shrank sound mixing buffer for better caching\n* new shader option: q3map_lightsubdivide. larger values make q3map -light proceed faster\n* new vertex array interleaving\n* fixed bmodels not counting patches in bounds\n* fixed patch sphere culling on rotating entities\n* cg_simpleItems now draws sprite items\n* fixed serverid being 0 when map is started from cmdline\n* fixed UI on mode changes\n* replaced 1280*960 mode with 1280*1024\n* test all rotated orders for tristrips from faces\n* fixed RB_SurfacePolychain to not duplicate vertexes\n* changed planar face surface type from a convex polygon to a general collection of coplanar triangles\n* change renderer to use bmodel surface list instead of tree\n* changed areabits pointer to areamask array\n* fixed bad loop when client reliable message overflows\n* fixed swapinterval after vid_restart\n* wall mark clipping moved out of cgame, extended for better wrapping over multiple brushes\n* picmip defaults to 1 under all cases now\n* automatic curve LOD grouping\n* duplicated SCR_ functions into cgame\n* implemented Micahel Julier's optimization work\n* implimented Michael Gold's SMP patch\n* new reliable command transport\n* use ENTITYNUM_NONE and ENTITYNUM_WORLD constants, which are now in MAX_GENTITIES range for safe net transport\n* wait for attack released after respawning before firing\n* added a delay before moving everyone to intermission spot\n* fixed bug with regibbing of gibbed body ques\n* blood trails behind gibs\n* changed localents over to trajectories\n* removed world as entity zero, clients are now 0 to MAXCLIENTS-1\n* changed game interface functions to use clientnums instead of pointers\n* removed speculative usercmd_t from user packets\n* new item pickup code, fixed silent item pickup on grazing hits, and expanded the pickup range by 20% without changing the physical bounding box\n* allow a single \"quick jump\" without delay"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-08-29", "contents": "sick"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-09-22", "contents": "I had a good time at the New York event -- it was fun to meet a lot of the web and clan guys, and there was some good fierce deathmatch action.\n\nThe QuakeWorld beta has revved a couple more times.

The final game will have an option to run in less memory, but the graphics and sound quality will be a lot lower.\n\n----------\n\nI made a simple change in the file management that I think is clearly a big win.\n\nInstead of scanning for pak0.pk3, pak1.pk3, ... pak9.pk3 in game directories, I now scan the entire directory for all .pk3 files, and add them to the search path in alphabetical order.\n\nThis gives us the same needed functionality we have now -- overriding things in pak0.pk3 with updated data in pak1.pk3, but it also gives a signficant benefit to the user community.\n\nThere has been a lot of requests to have textures inside maps like Quake1 did, but I was not willing to do that. Having the files separate saves an immense amount of duplication, and keeps the internal architecture uniform.\n\nNow, you can just add all your new art into a pk3 (zip) file along with your map and users can just drop that single file into their quake3/baseq3 directory as a single operation.\n\nThis will also be nice for custom models, which require several component parts: legs, torso, head, animations, levels of detail, and skins.\n\nSo, if you are strictly ADDING media (models, textures, maps, etc), then you can just drop the pk3 files in the normal directory.\n\nIf you are REPLACING data (code modules, menus, etc), you should make a new game directory and put the pk3 there. Starting up with \"quake3 +set game mygame\" will make all the mygame pk3 files override anything in baseq3. You could do it by just naming your pk3 file \"zzzstuff.pk3\", but then you wouldn't have a way to run the game without the addons.\n\nA prudent person might choose to put ALL addons into a separate directory and leave baseq3 pristine for official additions.\n\n----------\n\nOther stuff that has been done lately:\n\n* don't clamp dedicated server or client times until much later -- prevents time resets under ordinary conditions\n* fixed CG_ProcessSnapshots: cg.snap->serverTime\n* only drift time on receipt of packets with a steady ping -- improve catchup after drops\n* fixed players getting stuck together\n* new pak file support\n* derez mac resource file\n* intro/loop option for music files\n* fixed lerp-through-world when changing teams\n* show ping and netgraph for spectators\n* fixed timescale off by one problem\n* tracked down player count wrong on server list\n* info_spectator_start entity\n* shader language change: clampTexCoord removed, added clampmap\n* r_debugSort cvar for working on transparency sorting problems\n* changed minimum cl_maxpackets to 15\n* fixed can't-respawn-when-someone-is-on-your-body\n* fixed dlighting over alpha tested surfaces\n* z_stats lists all blocks >= given size\n* fixed wasted model slots\n* increased com_hunkmegs\n* com_buildScript cvar to force loading all media and quit on errors\n* fixed bad playerstate interpolation across teleporters\n* converted local sounds to sfxHandle_t\n* new fog code doesn't require subdivisions\n* fixed sun positioning problem\n* added fogging of triangle objects\n* fixed devmap issue\n* make g_log a filename instead of a 0/1\n* g_logsync option to force a flush after each write must be set at time of log file creation"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-04-26", "contents": "Interpreting the lagometer (the graph in the lower right corner):\n\nThe upper graph (blue/yellow) slides one pixel for every rendered frame. Blue lines below the baseline mean that the frame is interpolating between two valid snapshots. Yellow lines above the baseline mean the frame is extrapolating beyond the latest valid time. The length of the line is proportional to the time.\n\nThe lower graph (green/yellow/red) slides one pixel for every received snapshot. By default, snapshots come 20 times a second, so if you are running >20 fps, the top graph will move faster, and vice versa. A red bar means the snapshot was dropped by the network. Green and yellow bars are properly received snapshots, with the height of the bar proportional to the ping. A yellow bar indicates that the previous snapshot was intentionally supressed to stay under the rate limit.\n\nThe upper graph indicates the consistancy of your connection. Ideally, you should always have blue bars of only a pixel or two in height. If you are commonly getting big triangles of yellow on the graph, your connection is inconsistant.\n\nIn a heavy firefight, it is normal for modem players to see yellow bars in the bottom graph, which should return to green when the action quiets down. If you are getting several red bars visible, you may want to look for a server that drops less packets.\n\nThere are a few tuning variables for people trying to optimize their connection:\n\nThe most important one is \"rate\", which is what the connection speed option in the menu sets.\n\nWe are fairly conservative with the values we set for the given modem speeds: 2500 for 28.8, 3000 for 33, and 3500 for 56k.\n\nYou may actually be connecting faster than that, and modem compression may be buying you something, so you might get a better play experience by increasing the values slightly.\n\nIf you connect at 50000 bps, try a rate of 5000, etc.\n\nI err on the conservative side, because too low of a rate will only make the movement of other things in the world choppy, while too high of a rate can cause huge amounts of lag.\n\nNote that the optimal rate will be somewhat lower than a rate for QW or Q2, because I now include the UDP packet header length in the bandwidth estimate.\n\nYou can ask for a different number of snapshots by changing the \"snaps\" variable, but there isn't a lot of benefit to that. Dedicated servers run at 40hz, so stick to divisors of that: 40, 20 (default), 10. A snaps of 40 will usually just cause you to hit your rate limit a lot faster. It may be usefull for tuning rate, if nothing else.\n\nYou can adjust the local timing point with \"cg_timenudge \", which effectively adds local lag to try to make sure you interpolate instead of extrapolate. If you really want to play on a server that is dropping a ton of packets, a timenudge of 100 or so might make the game smoother.\n\n------ \nOne more addition to net cvars:\n\"cl_maxpackets\" will restrict the maximum number of outgoing packets to prevent client to server rate problems. This does not limit the client framerate. This defaults to 20, which might actually be a bit low.

I do read everything that comes my way (I can't respond to all of it, though), and I have learned a few things from the mail.\n\nNothing is set in stone yet, but it is still looking like a dll is going to be the primary interface. I have been seriously considering a java interface, but the tradeoffs (time spent implementing takes away from something else..) just don't quite add up. Other options, like enhancing qc or using other languages like perl have very remote chances.\n\nOne of the primary reasons is that you can allways build UP - put more functionality on top of a dll, but you can't allways build DOWN - accessing the registry from java for instance.\n\nFor Id Software to develop a game, a dll will be most efficient. We have more cpu power, and we can debug it more easily. We are directing significant effort towards making Quake 2 a better GAME, as well as just a better mutliplayer virtual world. Quake 1 was pretty messed up from a game standpoint, and we don't plan on doing that again.\n\nWhat I can offer the qc hacking crowd is a public release of the qc interface and interpreter code from Quake 1 when Quake 2 is released. The user community can then bolt things together so that there can be one publicly trusted DLL that executes an updated and modified qc language for portable, secure add ons.\n\nI really do care about portability, but it is just one factor that needs to be balanced against all the others. Things just aren't clear cut.\n\nSpeaking of portability, to remove the guesswork that goes on, here are my current opinions on the various platforms:\n\nWin32 \nWin32 rules the world. You are sticking your head in the sand if you think otherwise. The upside is that windows really doesn't suck nowdays. Win 95 / NT 4.0 are pretty decent systems for what they are targeted at. I currently develop mostly on NT, and Quake 2 will almost certainly be delivered on win32 first. Our games should run as well as possible in NT, we won't require any '95 only features.\n\nDos \nWe are not going to do another dos game. No amount of flaming hate mail is going to change my mind on this (PLEASE don't!). The advantages of good TCP/IP support, dynamic linking, powerfull virtual memory, device drivers, etc, are just too much to overcome. Yes, all of those can be provided under dos in various ways, but it just isn't worth it.\n\nLinux \nI consider linux the second most important platform after win32 for id. From a biz standpoint it would be ludicrous to place it even on par with mac or os/2, but for our types of games that are designed to be hacked, linux has a big plus: the highest hacker to user ratio of any os. I don't personally develop on linux, because I do my unixy things with NEXTSTEP, but I have a lot of technical respect for it.\n\nMacOS \nFrom a money making standpoint, the only OS other than win32 that matters, and it doesn't matter all that much. We have professional ports done to MacOS instead of unsupported hack ports, which is a mixed blessing. They come out a lot later (still waiting for quake..), but are more full featured. I have zero respect for the MacOS on a technical basis. They just stood still and let microsoft run right over them from waaay behind. I wouldn't develop on it.\n\nOS/2 \nA native OS/2 port of any of our products is unlikely. We just don't care enough, and we are unwilling to take time away from anything else.\n\nSGI \nI don't particularly care for IRIX as a development environment (compared to NT or NEXTSTEP), but SGI has the coolest hardware to run GL apps on. Safe to assume future IRIX ports, but its not exactly a top priority.\n\nAIX / OSF / HPUX / SOLARIS \nI wouldn't start a port to any of these, but if a trusted party (Zoid) wanted to do them, I probably wouldn't object.\n\nBeOS \nI bought a BeBox because I am a solid believer in SMP, and I like clean, from-scratch systems. I was left fairly non plussed by it. Yes, it is lean and mean and does a couple things better than any other OS I have seen, but I just don't see any dramatic advantages to it over, say, NEXTSTEP. Lion (the company doing the mac quake port) has a BeOS port of quake sort of working, and have my full support in releasing it, but it will be strictly an act of charity on their part, so don't expect too much.\n\nPlan9 \nI spent a few months running Plan9. It has an achingly elegent internal structure, but a user interface that has been asleep for the past decade. I had an older version of quake dedicated server running on it (don't ask me for it - I lost it somewhere) and I was writing a civilized window manager for it in my spare time, but my spare time turned out to be only a couple hours a month, and it just got prioritized out of existance.\n\nNEXTSTEP \nMy faviorite environment. NT and linux both have advantages in some areas, but if they were on equal footing I would choose NEXTSTEP hands down. It has all the power of unix (there are lots of things I miss in NT), the best UI (IMHO, of cource), and it just makes sense on so many more levels than windows. Yes, you can make windows do anything you want to if you have enough time to beat on it, but you can come out of it feeling like you just walked through a sewer.\n\nIn the real world, things aren't on equal footing, and I do most of my work on NT now. I hold out hope that it may not stay that way. If apple Does The Right Thing with rhapsody, I will be behind them as much as I can. NEXTSTEP needs a couple things to support games properly (video mode changing and low level sound access). If apple/next will provide them, I will personally port our current win32 products over.\n\nIf I can convince apple to do a good hardware accelerated OpenGL in rhapsody, I would be very likely to give my win NT machine the cold shoulder and do future development on rhapsody.

I got a couple months of pretty much wide open research done at the start, but it turned out that none of the early research actually had any bearing on the directions I finally decided on. Ah well, I learned a lot, and it will probably pay off at some later time.\n\nI spent a little while doing some basic research with lummigraphs, which are sort of a digital hologram. The space requirements are IMMENSE, on the order of several gigs uncompressed for even a single full sized room. I was considering the possibility of using very small lumigraph fragments (I called them \"lumigraphlets\") as imposters for large clusters of areas, similar to aproximating an area with a texture map, but it would effectively be a view dependent texture.\n\nThe results were interesting, but transitioning seamlessly would be difficult, the memory was still large, and it has all the same caching issues that any impostor scheme has.\n\nAnother aproach I worked on was basically extending the sky box code style of rendering from quake 2 into a complete rendering system. Take a large number of environment map snapshots, and render a view by interpolating between up to four maps (if in a tetrahedral arangement) based on the view position.\n\nA simple image based interpolating doesn't convey a sense of motion, because it basically just ghosts between seperate points unless the maps are VERY close together reletive to the nearest point visible in the images.\n\nIf the images that make up the environment map cube also contain depth values at some (generally lower) resolution, instead of rendering the environment map as six big flat squares at infinity, you can render it as a lot of little triangles at the proper world coordinates for the individual texture points. A single environment map like this can be walked around in and gives a sense of motion. If you have multiple maps from nearby locations, they can be easily blended together. Some effort should be made to nudge the mesh samples so that as many points are common between the maps as possible, but even a regular grid works ok.\n\nYou get texture smearing when occluded detail should be revealed, and if you move too far from the original camera point the textures blur out a lot, but it is still a very good effect, is completely complexity insensitive, and is aliasing free except when the view position causes a silhouette crease in the depth data.\n\nEven with low res environment maps like in Quake2, each snapshot would consume 700k, so taking several hundred environment images throughout a level would generate too much data. Obviously there is a great deal of redundancy - you will have several environment maps that contain the same wall image, for instance. I had an interesting idea for compressing it all. If you ignore specular lighting and atmospheric effects, any surface that is visible in multiple environment maps can be represented by a single copy of it and perspective transformation of that image. Single image, transformations, sounds like.. fractal compression. Normal fractal compression only deals with affine maps, but the extension to projective maps seems logical.\n\nI think that a certain type of game could be done with a technology like that, but in the end, I didn't think it was the right direction for a first person shooter.\n\nThere is a tie in between lummigraphs, multiple environment maps, specularity, convolution, and dynamic indirect lighting. Its nagging at me, but it hasn't come completely clear.\n\nOther topics for when I get the time to write more:\n\nMicro environment map based model lighting.

The idea is to have one processor doing all the game processing, database traversal, and lighting, while the other processor does absolutely nothing but issue OpenGL calls.\n\nThis effectively treats the second processor as a dedicated geometry accelerator for the 3D card. This can only improve performance if the card isn't the bottleneck, but voodoo2 and TNT cards aren't hitting their limits at 640*480 on even very fast processors right now.\n\nFor single player games where there is a lot of cpu time spent running the server, there could conceivably be up to an 80% speed improvement, but for network games and timedemos a more realistic goal is a 40% or so speed increase. I will be very satisfied if I can makes a dual pentium-pro 200 system perform like a pII-300.\n\nI started on the specialized code in the renderer, but it struck me that it might be possible to implement SMP acceleration with a generic OpenGL driver, which would allow Quake2 / sin / halflife to take advantage of it well before QuakeArena ships.\n\nIt took a day of hacking to get the basic framework set up: an smpgl.dll that spawns another thread that loads the original oepngl32.dll or 3dfxgl.dll, and watches a work que for all the functions to call.\n\nI get it basically working, then start doing some timings. Its 20% slower than the single processor version.\n\nI go in and optimize all the queing and working functions, tune the communications facilities, check for SMP cache collisions, etc.\n\nAfter a day of optimizing, I finally squeak out some performance gains on my tests, but they aren't very impressive: 3% to 15% on one test scene, but still slower on the another one.\n\nThis was fairly depressing. I had always been able to get pretty much linear speedups out of the multithreaded utilities I wrote, even up to sixteen processors. The difference is that the utilities just split up the work ahead of time, then don't talk to each other until they are done, while here the two threads work in a high bandwidth producer / consumer relationship.\n\nI finally got around to timing the actual communication overhead, and I was appalled: it was taking 12 msec to fill the que, and 17 msec to read it out on a single frame, even with nothing else going on. I'm surprised things got faster at all with that much overhead.\n\nThe test scene I was using created about 1.5 megs of data to relay all the function calls and vertex data for a frame. That data had to go to main memory from one processor, then back out of main memory to the other. Admitedly, it is a bitch of a scene, but that is where you want the acceleration..\n\nThe write times could be made over twice as fast if I could turn on the PII's write combining feature on a range of memory, but the reads (which were the gating factor) can't really be helped much.\n\nStreaming large amounts of data to and from main memory can be really grim. The next write may force a cache writeback to make room for it, then the read from memory to fill the cacheline (even if you are going to write over the entire thing), then eventually the writeback from the cache to main memory where you wanted it in the first place. You also tend to eat one more read when your program wants to use the original data that got evicted at the start.\n\nWhat is really needed for this type of interface is a streaming read cache protocol that performs similarly to the write combining: three dedicated cachelines that let you read or write from a range without evicting other things from the cache, and automatically prefetching the next cacheline as you read.\n\nIntel's write combining modes work great, but they can't be set directly from user mode. All drivers that fill DMA buffers (like OpenGL ICDs..) should definately be using them, though.\n\nPrefetch instructions can help with the stalls, but they still don't prevent all the wasted cache evictions.\n\nIt might be possible to avoid main memory alltogether by arranging things so that the sending processor ping-pongs between buffers that fit in L2, but I'm not sure if a cache coherent read on PIIs just goes from one L2 to the other, or if it becomes a forced memory transaction (or worse, two memory transactions). It would also limit the maximum amount of overlap in some situations. You would also get cache invalidation bus traffic.\n\nI could probably trim 30% of my data by going to a byte level encoding of all the function calls, instead of the explicit function pointer / parameter count / all-parms-are-32-bits that I have now, but half of the data is just raw vertex data, which isn't going to shrink unless I did evil things like quantize floats to shorts.\n\nToo much effort for what looks like a reletively minor speedup. I'm giving up on this aproach, and going back to explicit threading in the renderer so I can make most of the communicated data implicit.\n\nOh well.

Id software was really conceived when me, Tom, and Romero made a Super Mario 3 clone after I figured out how to do smooth scrolling EGA games. We actually sent it to nintendo to see if they wanted to publish a PC game, but the interest wasn't there. We wound up doing the Commander Keen games for Apogee instead, and the rest is history.\n\nI was looking forward to meeting Mr. Miyamoto, but he wound up canceling at the last minute. :(\n\nOh well. I hope everyone that went enjoyed my talk. All the other speakers had powerpoint presentations and detailed discussion plans, but I just rambled for an hour..\n\nI notced that there was a report about my discussion of model level of detail that was in error. I have an experimental harness, an algorithm, and a data structure for doing progressive mesh style LOD rendereing in the quake engine, but I suspect it won't make it into the production Quake 2. Other things are higher priority for us. I may assist some of the quake licensees if they want to pursue it later.\n\n-\n\nA couple data / feature changes going into the latest (and I hope final) revision of the Quake bsp file format:\n\nBack in my update a month ago where I discussed losing automatic frame animation in models to clean up the format and logic, I mentioned that I still supported automatic texture animation.\n\nNot anymore. There were several obnoxious internal details to dealing with it, especially now with textures outside the bsp file, so I changed the aproach.\n\nWhen a texture is grabbed, you can now specify another texture name as the next animation in a chain. Much better than the implicit-by-name specification from Quake1.\n\nNo animation is automatic now. A bmodel's frame number determines how far along the animation chain to go to find the frame. Textures without animation chains just stay in the original frame.\n\nThere is a slight cost in network traffic required to update frame numbers on otherwise unmoving objects, but due to the QuakeWorld style delta compression it is still less than a Quake 1 scene with no motion at all.\n\nThe benefit, aside from internal code cleanliness, is that a game can precisely control any sequence of animation on a surface. You could have cycles that go forward and backwards through a sequence, you could make slide projectors that only change on specific inputs, etc.\n\nYou could not independantly animate two sides of a bmodel that were not syncronized with the same number of frames, but you could allways split it into multiple models if your really needed to.\n\nEverything is simple when its done, but I actually agonized over animation specification for HOURS yesterday..\n\nThe last significant thing that I am working on in the map format is leaf clustering for vis operations. You can specify some map brushes as \"detail\" brushes, and others as \"structural\" brushes. The BSP and portal list is built for just the structural brushes, then the detail brushes are filtered in later.\n\nThis saves a bit of space, but is primarily for allowing complex levels to vis in a reasonable amount of time. The vis operation is very sensitive to complexity in open areas, and usually has an exponentially bad falloff time. Most of the complexity is in the form of small brushes that never really occlude anything. A box room with ten torch holders on the walls would consist of several dozen mostly open leafs. If the torch holders were made detail brushes, the room would just be a single leaf.\n\nA detail / structural seperation is also, I believe, key to making a portal renderer workable. I had a version of Quake that used portals at the convex volume level, and the performance characteristics had considerably worse-than-linear falloff with complexity. By reducing the leaf count considerably, it probably becomes very workable.

A sign bit, ten bits of mantissa, and five bits of exponent (possibly trading a bit or two between the mantissa and exponent). Even that isn't all you could want, but it is the rational step.\n\nIt is turning out that I need a destination alpha channel for a lot of the new rendering algorithms, so intermediate solutions like 10/12/10 RGB formats aren't a good idea. Higher internal precision with dithering to 32 bit pixels would have some benefit, but dithered intermediate results can easily start piling up the errors when passed over many times, as we have seen with 5/6/5 rendering.\n\nEight bits of precision isn't enough even for full range static image display. Images with a wide range usually come out fine, but restricted range images can easily show banding on a 24-bit display. Digital television specifies 10 bits of precision, and many printing operations are performed with 12 bits of precision.\n\nThe situation becomes much worse when you consider the losses after multiple operations. As a trivial case, consider having multiple lights on a wall, with their contribution to a pixel determined by a texture lookup. A single light will fall off towards 0 some distance away, and if it covers a large area, it will have visible bands as the light adds one unit, two units, etc. Each additional light from the same relative distance stacks its contribution on top of the earlier ones, which magnifies the amount of the step between bands: instead of going 0,1,2, it goes 0,2,4, etc. Pile a few lights up like this and look towards the dimmer area of the falloff, and you can believe you are back in 256-color land.\n\nThere are other more subtle issues, like the loss of potential result values from repeated squarings of input values, and clamping issues when you sum up multiple incident lights before modulating down by a material.\n\nRange is even more clear cut. There are some values that have intrinsic ranges of 0.0 to 1.0, like factors of reflection and filtering. Normalized vectors have a range of -1.0 to 1.0. However, the most central quantity in rendering, light, is completely unbounded. We want a LOT more than a 0.0 to 1.0 range. Q3 hacks the gamma tables to sacrifice a bit of precision to get a 0.0 to 2.0 range, but I wanted more than that for even primitive rendering techniques. To accurately model the full human sensable range of light values, you would need more than even a five bit exponent.\n\nThis wasn't much of an issue even a year ago, when we were happy to just cover the screen a couple times at a high framerate, but realtime graphics is moving away from just \"putting up wallpaper\" to calculating complex illumination equations at each pixel. It is not at all unreasonable to consider having twenty textures contribute to the final value of a pixel. Range and precision matter.\n\nA few common responses to this pitch:\n\n\"64 bits per pixel??? Are you crazy???\" Remember, it is exactly the same relative step as we made from 16 bit to 32 bit, which didn't take all that long.\n\nYes, it will be slower. That's ok. This is an important point: we can't continue to usefully use vastly greater fill rate without an increase in precision. You can always crank the resolution and multisample anti-alaising up higher, but that starts to have diminishing returns well before you use of the couple gigatexels of fill rate we are expected to have next year. The cool and interesting things to do with all that fill rate involves many passes composited into less pixels, making precision important.\n\n\"Can we just put it in the texture combiners and leave the framebuffer at 32 bits?\" No. There are always going to be shade trees that overflow a given number of texture units, and they are going to be the ones that need the extra precision. Scales and biases between the framebuffer and the higher precision internal calculations can get you some mileage (assuming you can bring the blend color into your combiners, which current cards can't), but its still not what you want. There are also passes which fundamentally aren't part of a single surface, but still combine to the same pixels, as with all forms of translucency, and many atmospheric effects.\n\n\"Do we need it in textures as well?\" Not for most image textures, but it still needs to be supported for textures that are used as function look up tables.\n\n\"Do we need it in the front buffer?\" Probably not. Going to a 64 bit front buffer would probably play hell with all sorts of other parts of the system. It is probably reasonable to stay with 32 bit front buffers with a blit from the 64 bit back buffer performing a lookup or scale and bias operation before dithering down to 32 bit. Dynamic light adaptation can also be done during this copy. Dithering can work quite well as long as you are only performing a single pass.\n\nI used to be pitching this in an abstract \"you probably should be doing this\" form, but two significant things have happened that have moved this up my hit list to something that I am fairly positive about.\n\nMark Peercy of SGI has shown, quite surprisingly, that all Renderman surface shaders can be decomposed into multi-pass graphics operations if two extensions are provided over basic OpenGL: the existing pixel texture extension, which allows dependent texture lookups (matrox already supports a form of this, and most vendors will over the next year), and signed, floating point colors through the graphics pipeline. It also makes heavy use of the existing, but rarely optimized, copyTexSubImage2D functionality for temporaries.\n\nThis is a truly striking result. In retrospect, it seems obvious that with adds, multiplies, table lookups, and stencil tests that you can perform any computation, but most people were working under the assumption that there were fundamentally different limitations for \"realtime\" renderers vs offline renderers. It may take hundreds or thousands of passes, but it clearly defines an approach with no fundamental limits. This is very important. I am looking forward to his Siggraph paper this year.\n\nOnce I set down and started writing new renderers targeted at GeForce level performance, the precision issue has started to bite me personally. There are quite a few times where I have gotten visible banding after a set of passes, or have had to worry about ordering operations to avoid clamping. There is nothing like actually dealing with problems that were mostly theoretical before..\n\n64 bit pixels. It is The Right Thing to do.

The reason for the limit is that coordinates are communicated over the network in 16 bit shorts divided as a sign bit, twelve unit bits, and three fractional bits. There was also another side to the representation problem, but it was rarely visible: if you timescale down, you can actually tell the fractional bit granularity in position and velocity.\n\nThe rest of the system (rendering and gameplay) has never had any issues with larger maps, even in quake 1. There are some single precision floating point issues that begin to creep in if things get really huge, but maps should be able to cover many times the current limit without any other changes.\n\nA while ago I had changed Q3 so that the number of fractional bits was a compile time option, which allowed you to trade off fine grain precision for larger size. I was considering automatically optimizing this for each level based on its size, but it still didn't feel like a great solution.\n\nAnother aspect of the problem that wasn't visible to the public was that the the fractional quantization of position could cause the position to actually be inside a nearby solid when used for client side prediction. The code had to check for this and try to correct the situation by jittering the position in each of the possible directions it might have been truncated from. This is a potential issue whenever there is any loss of precision whatsoever in the server to client communication.\n\nThe obvious solution is to just send the full floating point value for positions, but I resisted that because the majority of our network traffic is positional updates, and I didn't want to bloat it. There have been other bandwidth savings in Q3, and LANs and LPB connections are also relevent, so I was constantly evaluating the tradeoff.\n\nDealing with four or five players in view isn't a real problem. The big bandwidth issues arrive when multiple players start unloading with rapid fire weapons. (as an aside, I tried making 5hz fire weapons for Q3 to save bandwidth, but no matter how much damage they did, 5hz fire rates just seemed to feel slow and weak...)\n\nI finally moved to a bit-level stream encoding to save some more bandwidth and give me some more representational flexibility, and this got me thinking about the characteristics of the data that bother us.\n\nIn general, the floating point coordinates have significant bits all through the mantissa. Any movement along an angle will more or less randomize the low order bits.\n\nMy small little insight was that because missiles are evaluated parameterically instead of itteretively in Q3, a one-time snapping of the coordinates can be performed at their generation time, giving them fixed values with less significant bits for their lifetime without any effort outside their spawning function. It also works for doors and plats, which are also parametrically represented now. Most events will also have integral coordinates.\n\nThe float encoder can check for an integral value in a certain range and send that as a smaller number of bits, say 13 or so. If the value isn't integral, it will be transmitted as a full 32 bit float.\n\nThe other thing I am investigating is sub-byte delta encoding of floating point values. Even with arbitrary precision movement deltas, the sign and exponent bits change with very low frequency except when you are very near the origin. At the minimum, I should be able to cut the standard player coordinate delta reps to three bytes from four.\n\nSo, the bottom line is that the bandwidth won't move much (it might even go down if I cut the integral bits below 15), the maps become unbounded in size to the point of single precision roundoff, and the client doesn't have to care about position jittering (which was visible in Q3 code that will be released)."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-04-25", "contents": "Some people seem to think that I just make up these performance comparison numbers. I don't. I measure things, and I understand control conditions.\n\nIn this discussion, assume \"wintel\" is a 500 mhz PIII with either a agp rage128, or an agp TNT card, and \"macos\" is a 400 mhz G3 with the pci rage128.\n\nAt the highest level, you can make application class comparisons between platforms. For instance, CodeWarrior on the mac compiles faster than VC++ on wintel, but stuffit is way slower than winzip. This is useful data, but says more about the application design than the relative merits of the platforms. CW uses a single object file repository, for instance.\n\nA better comparison is an identical app on both platforms.\n\nPhotoshop is often faster on macos than wintel. There is certainly a lot of common code, but individual filters are optimized for each platform. Some of these hand optimized operations are significantly faster on the mac.\n\nQuake1 was the counterpoint to that. Quake1 had significant amounts of hand tuned asm code for intel, and the PPC version never got as much attention. The PPC version was noticeably slower (you would have to time at 640*480 to avoid unfairly penalizing the mac for lack of low res modes).\n\nSo, clearly, hand tuned asm code can make either platform pull ahead. It also shows that the two platforms are at least fairly close in performance. I never said macs were SLOW, just not quite as fast as the best intel systems.\n\nQuake3 doesn't software rasterize, so there isn't any great place for lots of asm code (the great place is in the OpenGL driver). The code is essentially identical on all platforms.\n\nQ3 is definitely faster on a wintel system than a macos system. When the wintel version is released, everyone will be independantly repeating that measurement.\n\nEven this measurement isn't exactly an apples to apples comparison, because the OpenGL driver and 3D card are still a significant variance. The two can be broken out farther: Q3 can be run without 3D output to test just the identical compiled code. Wintel is still faster, although somewhat less so. The OpenGL + 3D card setup can be benchmarked separately on the axis of throughput and fill rate, which show the intel system being significantly faster. I can't break that apart into the two separate components, but I will guess that the OpenGL driver is probably as efficient as the wintel drivers and the performance delta is due to the system interface and the video card. The current mac rage128 cards run at 75 mhz, which is a third slower than the PC cards. AGP is also more than just a faster PCI, it can influence the structure of communication with the card.\n\nIt has been my observation in the past that most of my code tracks just about midway between specint and specfp for performance comparisons. There is a lot of floating point, but it is all short vectors, rather than the massive vectors of scientific computing. If we discount the graphics subsystem, Q3 follows this reasonably well. The intel system does slightly better than projected.\n\n\"Sucks\" is a subjective description that can be dismissed as opinion. Note that I have NEVER said that the hardware sucks, or the user interface sucks, just that the mac OPERATING SYSTEM sucks.\n\n\"Faster\", when qualified with testing conditions, is objective, and all the wishing in the world doesn't change it.\n\nObjectivity and quantification are the paths to improvement.\n\nI will be very happy if Apple can produce a desktop system that is faster than anything else you can get. I respect good engineering from any source. Altivec should be better than the PIII extensions (trinary ops -- yeah!). The upcoming system architectures look good. They have a shot at it, but they won't make it if they complacently think \"oh, we are already faster than any pc system\".\n\nMy twin turbo F50 can still be outrun at the dragstrip by much cheaper race cars. Many ferrari owners would not dare set foot at a drag strip, because they fear objective measurements that may not show their important possession in the best light.

The plan was always to do something RAGE-related on the iPhone/iPad/iPod touch next, but with all the big things going on at id, the mobile efforts weren\u0092t front and center on the priority list. There had been a bit of background work going on, but it was only towards the end of July that I was able to sit down and write the core engine code that would drive the project.\n\nI was excited about how well it turned out, and since this was right before QuakeCon, I broke with tradition and did a live technology demo during my keynote. In hindsight, I probably introduced it poorly. I said something like \u0093Its RAGE. On the iPhone. At 60 frames a second.\u0094  Some people took that to mean that the entire PC/console game experience was going to be on the iPhone, which is definitely not the case.\n\nWhat I showed was a technology demo, written from scratch, but using the RAGE content creation pipeline and media. We do not have the full RAGE game running on iOS, and we do not plan to try. While it would (amazingly!) actually be possible to compile the full-blown PC/console RAGE game for an iPhone4 with some effort, it would be a hopelessly bad idea. Even the latest and greatest mobile devices are still a fraction of the power of a 360 or PS3, let alone a high end gaming PC, so none of the carefully made performance tradeoffs would be appropriate for the platform, to say nothing of the vast differences in controls.\n\nWhat we do have is something unlike anything ever seen on the iOS platforms. It is glorious, and a lot of fun. Development has been proceeding at high intensity since QuakeCon, and we hope to have the app out by the end of November.\n\nThe technical decision to use our megatexture content creation pipeline for the game levels had consequences for its scope. The data required for the game is big. Really, really big. Seeing Myst do well on the iPhone with a 700 meg download gave me some confidence that users would still download huge apps, and that became the target size for our standard definition version, but the high definition version for iPad / iPhone 4 will be around twice that size. This is more like getting a movie than an app, so be prepared for a long download. Still, for perspective, the full scale RAGE game is around 20 gigs of data with JPEG-XR compression, so 0.7 gigs of non-transcoded data is obviously a tiny slice of it.\n\nSince we weren\u0092t going to be able to have lots of hugely expansive levels, we knew that there would be some disappointment if we went out at a high price point, no matter how good it looked. We have experimented with a range of price points on the iPhone titles so far, but we had avoided the very low end. We decided that this would be a good opportunity to try a  $0.99 SD / $1.99 HD price point.  We need to stay focused on not letting the project creep out of control, but I think people will be very happy with the value.\n\nThe little slice of RAGE that we decided to build the iPhone product around is \u0093Mutant Bash TV\u0094, a post apocalyptic combat game show in the RAGE wasteland. This is the perfect setup for a quintessential first person shooter game play experience \u0097 you pick your targets, aim your shots, time your reloads, dodge the bad guys, and try and make it through to the end of the level with a better score than last time. Beyond basic survival, there are pickups, head shots, and hit streak multipliers to add more options to the gameplay, and there is a broad range of skill levels available from keep-hitting-fire-and-you-should-make-it to almost-impossible.\n\nA large goal of the project has been to make sure that the levels can be replayed many times. The key is making the gamplay itself the rewarding aspect, rather than story progression, character development, or any kind of surprises. Many of the elements that made Doom Resurrection good the first time you played it hurt the replayability, for instance. RAGE iOS is all action, all the time. I have played the game dozens of times, and testing it is still fun instead of a chore.\n\n@Technical Geek Details@\n\nThe id Tech 5 engine uses a uniform paged virtual texture system for basically everything in the game. While the algorithm would be possible on 3GS and later devices, it has a substantial per-fragment processing cost, and updating individual pages in a physical texture is not possible with PVRTC format textures. The approach used for mobile RAGE is to do the texture streaming based on variable sized contiguous \u0093texture islands\u0094 in the world. This is much faster, but it forces geometric subdivision of large surfaces, and must be completely predictive instead of feedback reactive. Characters, items, and UI are traditionally textured.\n\nWe build the levels and preview them in RAGE on the PC, then run a profiling / extraction tool to generate the map data for the iOS game. This tool takes the path through the game and determines which texture islands are going to be visible, and at what resolution and orientation. The pixels for the texture island are extracted from the big RAGE page file, then anisotropically filtered into as many different versions as needed, and packed into 1024\u00d71024 textures that are PVRTC compressed for the device.\n\nThe packing into the textures has conflicting goals \u0096 to minimize total app size you want to cram texture islands in everywhere they can fit, but you also don\u0092t want to scatter the islands needed for a given view into a hundred different textures, or radically change your working set in nearby views. As with many NP complete problems, I wound up with a greedy value metric optimizing allocation strategy.\n\nManaging over a gig of media made dealing with flash memory IO and process memory management very important, and I did a lot of performance investigations to figure things out.\n\nCritically, almost all of the data is static, and can be freely discarded. iOS does not have a swapfile, so if you use too much dynamic memory, the OS gives you a warning or two, then kills your process. The bane of iOS developers is that \u0093too much\u0094 is not defined, and in fact varies based on what other apps (Safari, Mail, iPod, etc) that are in memory have done. If you read all your game data into memory, the OS can\u0092t do anything with it, and you are in danger. However, if all of your data is in a read-only memory mapped file, the OS can throw it out at will. This will cause a game hitch when you need it next, but it beats an abrupt termination. The low memory warning does still cause the frame rate to go to hell for a couple seconds as all the other apps try to discard things, even if the game doesn\u0092t do much.\n\nInterestingly, you can only memory map about 700 megs of virtual address space, which is a bit surprising for a 32 bit OS. I expected at least twice that, if not close to 3 gigs. We sometimes have a decent fraction of this mapped.\n\nA page fault to a memory mapped file takes between 1.8 ms on an iPhone 4 and 2.2 ms on an iPod 2, and brings in 32k of data. There appears to be an optimization where if you fault at the very beginning of a file, it brings in 128k instead of 32k, which has implications for file headers.\n\nI am pleased to report that fcntl( fd, F_NOCACHE ) works exactly as desired on iOS \u0096 I always worry about behavior of historic unix flags on Apple OSs. Using this and page aligned target memory will bypass the file cache and give very repeatable performance ranging from the page fault bandwidth with 32k reads up to 30 mb/s for one meg reads (22 mb/s for the old iPod). This is fractionally faster than straight reads due to the zero copy, but the important point is that it won\u0092t evict any other buffer data that may have better temporal locality. All the world megatexture data is managed with uncached reads, since I know what I need well ahead of time, and there is a clear case for eviction. When you are past a given area, those unique textures won\u0092t be needed again, unlike, say monster animations and audio, which are likely to reappear later.\n\nI pre-touch the relevant world geometry in the uncached read thread after a texture read has completed, but in hindsight I should have bundled the world geometry directly with the textures and also gotten that with uncached reads.\n\nOpenAL appears to have a limit of 1024 sound buffers, which we bumped into. We could dynamically create and destroy the static buffer mappings without too much trouble, but that is a reasonable number for us to stay under.\n\nAnother behavior of OpenAL that surprised me was finding (by looking at the disassembly) that it touches every 4k of the buffer on a Play() command. This makes some sense, forcing it to page the entire thing into ram so you don\u0092t get broken sound mixing, but it does unpredictably stall the thread issuing the call. I had sort of hoped that they were just eating the page faults in the mixing thread with a decent sized mix ahead buffer, but I presume that they found pathological cases of a dozen sound buffers faulting while the GPU is sucking up all the bus bandwidth or some such. I may yet queue all OpenAL commands to a separate thread, so if it has to page stuff in, the audio will just be slightly delayed instead of hitching the framerate.\n\nI wish I could prioritize the queuing of flash reads \u0096 game thread CPU faults highest, sound samples medium, and textures lowest. I did find that breaking the big texture reads up into chunks helped with the worst case CPU stalls.\n\nThere are two project technical decisions that I fretted over a lot:\n\nBecause I knew that the basic rendering technology could be expressed with fixed function rendering, the game is written to OpenGL ES 1.1, and can run on the older MBX GPU platforms. While it is nice to support older platforms, all evidence is that they are a negligible part of the market, and I did give up some optimization and feature opportunities for the decision.\n\nIt was sort of fun to dust off the old fixed function puzzle skills. For instance, getting monochrome dynamic lighting on top of the DOT3 normal mapping in a single pass involved sticking the lighting factor in the alpha channel of the texture environment color so it feeds through to the blender, where a GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ZERO blend mode effects the modulation on the opaque characters. This sort of fixed function trickery still makes me smile a bit, but it isn\u0092t a relevant skill in the modern world of fragment shaders.\n\nThe other big one is the codebase lineage.\n\nMy personally written set of iPhone code includes the renderer for Wolfenstein RPG, all the iPhone specific code in Wolfenstein Classic and Doom Classic, and a few one-off test applications. At this point, I feel that I have a pretty good idea of what The Right Thing To Do on the platform is, but I don\u0092t have a mature expression of that in a full game. There is some decent code in Doom Classic, but it is all C, and I would prefer to do new game development in (restrained) C++.\n\nWhat we did have was Doom Resurrection, which was developed for us by Escalation Studios, with only a few pointers here and there from me. The play style was a pretty close match (there is much more freedom to look around in RAGE), so it seemed like a sensible thing. This fits with the school of thought that says \u0093never throw away the code\u0094 (http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html ). I take issue with various parts of that, and much of my success over the years has involved wadding things up and throwing it all away, but there is still some wisdom there.\n\nI have a good idea what the codebase would look like if I wrote it from scratch. It would have under 100k of mutable CPU data, there wouldn\u0092t be a resource related character string in sight, and it would run at 60 fps on new platforms / 30 fps on old ones. I\u0092m sure I could do it in four months or so (but I am probably wrong). Unfortunately, I can\u0092t put four months into an iPhone project. I\u0092m pushing it with two months \u0096  I have the final big RAGE crunch and forward looking R&D to get back to.\n\nSo we built on the Resurrection codebase, which traded expediency for various compromise in code efficiency. It was an interesting experience for me, since almost all the code that I normally deal with has my \u0093coding DNA\u0094 on it, because the id Software coding standards were basically \u0093program the way John does.\u0094  The Escalation programmers come from a completely different background, and the codebase is all STL this, boost that, fill-up-the-property list, dispatch the event, and delegate that.\n\nI had been harboring some suspicions that our big codebases might benefit from the application of some more of the various \u0093modern\u0094 C++ design patterns, despite seeing other large game codebases suffer under them. I have since recanted that suspicion.\n\nI whine a lot about it (occasionally on twitter), and I sometimes point out various object lessons to the other mobile programmers, but in the end, it works, and it was probably the right decision."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-05-31", "contents": "* based load plaque removal on framecount instead of updates\n* fixed crash bug with zerod notify lines\n* load / save game menus converted to slots instead of file names\n* end1 / end2 shareware / registered end screens\n* triggered monsters no longer awake on invisible or notarget players\n* broke out default.cfg from quake.rc\n* fixed five way counter trigger message\n* fixed push triggers to be frame rate independent\n* translated spaces to _ in savegame comment to make stdio happy\n* escape in keygrab now justs turns it off\n* protected against recursive loop when Con_Printf inside\nSCR_UpdateScreen\n\nis model name caching being done correctly for the flushed world model\nname?\ncenterprint message delay times\nfade screen behind menus\ngib big monsters\ncl itemgettimes aren't saved.  do they need to be?\nweapon nudges on different view sizes\nslime ambient sounds\ncenter everything in higher res modes\ngot stuck by explosion near zombies\nreturn to jrstart stuff\namtest98 needs new teleport textures\nreset defaults option\nreset to defaults option\ntrack down load failed comments\nwhy do menu sounds ometimes not work?\ncombo look/strafe\nfix lightning\npush trigger directionality wierdness"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-05-25", "contents": "* fixed savegame / phantom box bug\n* fixed underwater\n* allow monsters to sight other just-damaged monsters as clients\n* fixed lookspring\n\n+ secrets and kills are backwards\n\ntighten dlight radius/attenuation\ncopy center prints to console\nthe portal bug\ncue music on completion"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-05-18", "contents": "* make func_wall toggle frame on use\n* QuakeEd: remove bsp->leaktest\n* QuakeEd: filter world\n* QuakeEd: remove clicked on regioned brush message\n* QuakeEd: don't allow retexture in wireframe mode\n* QuakeEd: new brush heights are now snapped to grid\n* default .bsp extension to bspinfo\n\n+ enforcer bolts\n+ sound for all monsters hitting ground\n+ 64 bit clean qcc\n+ parms for all + commands to identify source\n+ body que isn't working\n\nteleport effect\nglobal sfx volume option\nfrag bar highlight\npermanently shifted view angle on restart\ngoddamn dos \\r text shit in output from NT tools messes up NeXT tools\ncheck for small area polygons and portals"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-05-24", "contents": "* added lookspring back\n* fixed client PVS for checkclient to be from viewofs\n* fixed no sighting underwater\n* no tarbaby damage to each other\n* blob explosion core\n* cleared prog stack on prog error, so recursion pverflow doesn't give\nerror\n* fixed shalrath pain frame bug\n* settriggermodel() now does angle, movetype, and solid init\n* reduced client to server packet size\n* trigger_changelevel fires targets\n* end of level stuff\n\nwrite a multi-platfirn C shell script for makefiles\n360 jump trigger\nshootable triggers?\ntake away all screen effects at completion\nintermission code\nmore monster awareness to nearby carnage\nreduce monster accuracy with invisibility\nhigh res centerings\nremove counters if cheating\nrename cheat codes\ngeneralize button0 button1 to button 0 -

We will fix them. The later releases will be better.\n\nEven if we had the windows distribution ready to go right now, I would still seriously consider releasing one of the mac or linux versions first because it will make our tracking a lot easier.\n\nThe holdup on the windows side are the issues with updated driver distribution. The game itself doesn't have any holdups.\n\nWe could do a windows release for just, say, voodoo2 owners and get some of the benefit of a controlled release, but it wouldn't really work out, because everyone would figure out that it can be made to (almost) work on lots of other cards by tweaking some values. That type of feedback would not be useful, because we KNOW that there are problems with most of the current drivers.

This is just the beginning of the testing and release process.\n\n One conspiracy theory suggests that Apple is somehow getting us to do this.\n\nWhat we have \"gotten\" from Apple is a few development machines. No cash payoff. No bundling deal. No marketing contract.\n\nI am looking at this long term. I want to see OS X become a top notch platform for graphics development. I think highly of the NEXTSTEP heritage and I might move my development from NT if it turns out well. There is a lot of groundwork that needs to be laid with apple for this to happen, and my working on the mac right now is part of that. Plus a lot of complaining to various apple engineers and executives. :-)\n\nTo be clear:\n\nAt this time, there is no mac that is as fast for gaming (or just about anything, actually) as a pentium III with a top of the line 3D card. Period. I have been misquoted by some mac evangelists as saying otherwise.\n\nThe new (blue and white) G3 systems are very good systems in many ways, and make a perfectly good gaming platform. However, a high end wintel machine just has more horsepower on both the CPU and the 3D card.\n\nA 400 mhz G3 performs about the same as a 400 mhz PII if they aren't fill rate limited, where the faster cards on the PC will give about a 25% advantage. A 500 mhz PIII with an appropriate card in 30% faster than the best mac you can buy.\n\nThe multi colored iMacs, old G3 desktops, and powerbooks can play Quake3, but the RagePro 3D acceleration defines the absolute bottom end of our supported platforms. A serious gamer will not be satisfied with it.\n\nVoodoo cards are not currently supported by the OpenGL driver, which is very unfortunate because many serious mac gamers own voodoo cards. I hope Apple and 3dfx will be able to correct this soon, but I certainly understand Apple's prioritization -- obviously, good support for the OEM video options is of primary importance.\n\nThe voodoo performance will still lag the windows platform by some amount, but some strides have been made in that area recently, so I expect good performance,\n\nGaming is not a reason to buy a mac, but Apple is taking steps so that it may not be a reason to avoid a mac if you have other reasons for wanting one.\n\nMacOS still sucks."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-04-30", "contents": "I put together a document on optimizing OpenGL drivers for Q3 that should be helpfull to the various linux 3D teams.\n\nhttp://www.quake3arena.com/news/glopt.html\n\n\n-------\n* vmtest framework, q3asm work\n* converted scene building to procedural style. allows better error checking, better performance characteristics when interpreted, and is a setup stage for SMP optimizations in the renderer if I get around to it\n* protected some potential div by 0 areas in cgame"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1998-07-16", "contents": "I have spent the last two days working with Apple's Rhapsody DR2, and I like it a lot.\n\nI was dissapointed with the original DR1 release.

General speed is up, memory consumption is down, and the UI feels consistant and productive.\n\nIts still not as fast as windows, and probably never will be, but I think the tradeoffs are valid.\n\nThere are so many things that are just fundamentally better in the rhapsody design than in windows: frameworks, the yellow box apis, fat binaries, buffered windows, strong multi user support, strong system / local seperation, netinfo, etc.\n\nRight now, I think WindowsNT is the best place to do graphics development work, but if the 3D acceleration issue was properly addressed on rhapsody, I think that I could be happy using it as my primary development platform.\n\nI ported the current Quake codebase to rhapsody to test out conix's beta OpenGL. The game isn't really playable with the software emulated OpenGL, but it functions properly, and it makes a fine dedicated server.\n\nWe are going to try to stay on top of the portability a little better for QA. Quake 2 slid a bit because we did the development on NT instead of NEXTSTEP, and that made the irix port a lot more of a hassle than the original glquake port.\n\nI plan on using the rhapsody system as a dedicated server during development, and Brian will be using an Alpha-NT system for a lot of testing, which should give us pretty good coverage of the portability issues.\n\nI'm supposed to go out and have a bunch of meetings at apple next month to cover games, graphics, and hardware. Various parts of apple have scheduled meetings with me on three seperate occasions over the past couple years, but they have always been canceled for one reason or another (they laid off the people I was going to meet with once..).\n\nI have said some negative things about MacOs before, but my knowledge of the mac is five years old.

With a five person team, we had six months to bring it all together on a new platform. I wrote the code for the hardware accelerated 3D renderer and for the remainder of the project, I was technical advisor.\n\nThe basic compute power of a 32 bit, 66 mhz arm processor and four megs of ram is a pleasant size to work with, basically about what we had on the PC back when the original Doom was written. You are intrinsically limited to a design that is compact enough that you can wrap your head around every aspect of it at once, but you don't wind up mired in crazy size decisions like trading a couple functions of code for an extra graphical icon.\n\nGoing back to fixed point math is always a chore, and while the DS has hardware acceleration for fixed point math, it doesn't automatically integrate with C/C++ code. The compiler / linker / debugger tool chain worked just fine, and I never felt that I was fighting the development environment like it used to be with the really early consoles. The DS SDK takes my preferred approach of both documenting the hardware fully and providing a helper library with full source code that you can pull apart as necessary.\n\nThe baseline spec we started with was a 16 meg cart for the game. I was sure we could get all the features we were discussing to fit in there, but in hindsight, we really should have pushed for a 32 meg cart, because it would have allowed us to add a lot more high quality 2D art to the game, and include some pre-rendered cinematics to help set the mood and tell the story. Anna had pushed for this from the beginning, but I was worried that we wouldn't have enough time to create the additional media, and I didn't want to eat the extra manufacturing costs on a speculative game release of an unknown IP.\n\nAt first glance, a 16 meg cart is over eight times as large as our high end cell phone distribution, but that turns out to be misleading. Everything is highly compressed on the mobile versions, but because of the need to directly DMA many assets in a usable form on the DS, and sometimes due to the tighter ram limits, a lot of the media takes up more space on the DS. The game is still a lot bigger, but not 8x.\n\nInterfacing with the DS 3D graphics processor was my major contribution to the project. The DS is an unusual graphics machine, with no direct analog before it, but the individual pieces were close enough to things I had experience with that I was able to be effective pretty quickly. While there are a few things I wish would have been done differently, I still found it a lot of fun to work with.\n\n\nThe geometry engine is nice and clean, implementing a good subset of the basic OpenGL pipe in fixed point. It is also quite fast relative to the rest of the system. I had originally laid out the code to double buffer all the command traffic so that the geometry engine could completely overlap with the CPU, but it turned out that we would run into the polygon limits on the rasterizer before the geometry engine worked up much of a sweat, so I just saved memory and let the geometry engine run with a single command buffer. The game logic tended to take more time to process than the geometry engine, so it was almost never a gating factor. A title that heavily used vertex lighting and matrix stack operations might be able to load up the geometry pipeline a bit, but with just texture and color at the verts, it has margin.\n\nUnlike classic OpenGL, you can change the matrix in the middle of specifying a primitive, allowing single bone skinned model rendering to be performed with a conventional vertex pipeline. This was a novel approach that I hadn't seen anywhere else. It was a little odd to see an explicitly separate model and projection matrix in hardware, since they are usually pre-multiplied into a single MVP matrix, but it allows the slow main cpu to avoid having to do some matrix math.\n\nThe question of 3D models versus sprites was one of the most significant decisions for Orcs&Elves. There are several situations in the game where you may be facing six or eight monsters, and I was concerned about how low poly the enemies would have to be to avoid problems with the rasterizer, especially when you consider that monsters can chase you into scenes that may tax the rasterizer all by themselves. Coupled with the fact that developing a new skeletal animation system, building all new models, and animating them would almost certainly have busted our development timeline, in the given circumstances, we decided sprites would do a better job.\n\nThe rasterization side of things on the DS is... quirky. Almost all 3D rendering systems today use a frame buffer and a depth buffer that is stored in dedicated graphics memory and incrementally updated by the graphics processor. The DS essentially renders as it is being displayed, with only a small set of lines acting as a buffer. This saves memory, and can give speed and power savings, but it has some significant tradeoffs.\n\nFailure modes are bad -- If you overload the polygon list, the remaining polygons just don't show up. This can be mediated by drawing the nearby and important things first, so if anything disappears it is hopefully in the distance where it isn't very noticeable. If you overload the fill rate, horizontal bars appear across the screen. In a perspective view, the greatest complexity and density tend to be in the middle of the screen, so if your scene gets too bad, a jittering color bar tends to appear in the center.\n\nIn a conventional rendering engine, overloading complexity just tends to make the game go slower. On the DS, overloading looks broken. This means that you need to leave yourself a lot more margin, and therefore use the hardware less aggressively. The plus side is that since the hardware is re-drawing the screen at 60hz no matter what you do, you are strongly encouraged to make sure the rest of your game also stays at 60hz.\n\n\nThe lack of texture filtering on the DS is the most obvious difference with other current platforms, and it does strongly encourages a cartoony art style for games. The art style for O&E isn't really ideal, and perhaps we should have stylized things a bit more.\n\nYou don't have a lot of texture memory available on the DS, less even than an original Playstation. In O&E, the environment graphics (walls and floors) are allocated statically at map load time, and must be balanced by the level artist. The character sprites are dynamically managed, with high resolution artwork for the monster directly in front of the player being swapped in every frame. The field of view and sprite positioning are carefully managed, along with a \"pushback factor\", to ensure that the sprites are at 1:1 scale when they are one tile away, and 2:1 scale when they are right in front of the player. Without bilinear filtering on the texturing, non-integral scales wind up looking very ugly. This is one of the advantages of the tile based play -- if it was completely free form, the monsters would look a lot uglier. There isn't any intermediate step to be taken to improve the monster rendering without using a full 4x the memory to render an adjacent monster at a 1:1 scale. Even if we had more memory, I probably would have spent it on more animations instead of higher resolution.\n\nThe most disappointing mistake in the DS hardware is the lack of even the basic original blending modes from OpenGL. This was a mistake that was common in the very first generation of PC 3D accelerators, where so many companies just assumed that \"blending\" meant \"alpha blending\", and they didn't include support for add, modulate, and the other standard blending modes. No relevant company had made that mistake in a decade, and Nintendo's consoles have always done it right since the U64, so it was a surprise to see it in the DS. Additive blending in particular is crucial to most \"3D flash\" sorts of rendering, and various non-additive modulation modes are used for light mapping and other core rendering features.\n\nI only got to spend four days actually writing all the 3D code for Orcs&Elves, so there are lots of potential directions that I am interested in exploring in the future. We plan to have two more DS projects in development next year, which I hope will let me try out a skeletal animation system, experiment with the networking hardware, and implement a more flexible high level culling algorithm than what I used in O&E.\n\nJohn Carmack"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-06-06", "contents": "* carry serverflags from level to level\n* items fire targets when picked up\n* different spikes for super, knight, and wiz\n* removed requirement that triggers have a target\n* removed all references to update_type\n* lightning gun underwater explosion removes currentammo\n* fixed bug in fat pvs that caused entire world to show on some frames\n*.5 trigger only teleporters\n* delete key bindings and prohibit tripple bindings\n* blured savegame line\n* don't allow cmd buffer sizebuf overflow\n* behind menu fade\n* seperate cursors for console and menu\n* changed entity spawning to spawn-as-loaded\n* move light entity hack to pogs\n* draw sigils on status bar\n\n+ remove self.running?\n+ portal creation bug\n+ make lightning gun more damaging again\n+ sigil things on status bar\n+ signon1 when at 1\n+ weapon nudges\n+ player faces\n+ put talk.wav back in\n+ wait before allowing intermission exit\n+ teleport ambient sound?\n\nquad damage liughtning explosion\nmenu4.wav for slider\nmake a generic signon stream and subdivide svs.signon more\nvelocity through levels?\nall projectiles need a t ent\nfinish axe up\npickup weapons while firing bug\ntick sound when pressing an unbound key?\nescape back through menus\nloadgame removes enemy state?\ndeathmatch intermission\ntexture animation speeds variable\nuse different exiting water sound"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-07-25", "contents": "Id Software went to the drag strip today.\n\nThe 100 degree heat was pretty opressive, and my NOS regulator wasn't working, but a good time was had by all.\n\nI made six runs in the 126 to 133 mph range and didn't even burn a spark plug, which is a nice change from a couple road track events I have been to.\n\nBest times for everyone:\n\n[code]\nBob Norwood's PCA race car: 10.9 / 133 mph (slicks)\nMy turbo testarossa         12.1 / 132\nAdrian's viper              13.5 / 105\nTodd's 'vette               13.9 / 101\nTim's porsche               14.3 / 96\nBear's supra:               14.4 / 96\nCash's M3                   15.2 / 94\n[/code]\n\nMy TR is never going to be a good drag car (>4000 lbs!), but when we go back on a cool day this fall and I get my NOS running, it should be good for over 140 in the quarter. 50 mph to 200 mph is it's real sweet spot.\n\nI think Bear is heading for the chip dealer so he can get ahead of Tim :)"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-09-08", "contents": "* fixed time clamping issue\n* removed win32isms from snd_mix.c and snd_dma.c\n* optimized dsound locks\n\n+ scale texture stats by texture size\n+ not autodetecting PII for mono lightmaps?\n+ put swaps from ref into qshared?\n+ walk backwards when looking straight up?\n\nseperate #define for asm code?\nswim up with jump key\nwindow close box\nreload textures only on context recreation\ndo a stereo gl implementation on intergraph?\nitem using..."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-06-12", "contents": "* limit sound buffers to 4k, add extra mix points and mix full buffer\n* fixed only registered trigger messages\n* boss shouldn't spawn in deathmatch\n* cleared move commands across level transitions\n* 8 bit sound output volume scaling\n* key configuration didn't work for changeweapon \"impulse 10\"\n* options menu now resets string values of cvars\n* talk drawing properly updates with sized down screen\n* clear net connection ques on new connection\n* f5 cheat or's in items\n* removed error for unconnected buttons\n* power up status bar faces\n* armor number\n* increased surface cache size\n* end of game text\n* menu up/down wrapping\n* Sandy's menu suggestions\n* jrstart alternate start point if returning\n* play track 3 on intermission\n* drop backpacks in coop\n* got deathmatch invisibility working\n\nclip into sky problem\ndemon smashed a player stuck into a sloping wall\nno cheat in coop\nautomatic listen 2\ntalk message printing code\ndoor sounds\ncheck fly/float move code\ncheck weapon changing while firing\ncheck messagemode bound keys\n\"restart\" on a client of a net game crashes\nserverflag only trigger\ngib head positioning\nability to specify cd track on demo recording\ncoop use solo scoreboard\ntwo presses to exit intermission\ndeathmatch intermission screen\nharder nightmare\nname and color should be saved as cvars\nundead players?

After Doom Resurrection had its time in the sun, I was prepared to put the rest of the work into Doom Classic, but we ran into another schedule conflict.  As I related in my Wolf Classic notes http://www.idsoftware.com/wolfenstein-3d-classic-platinum/wolfdevelopment.htm , Wolfenstein RPG for the iPhone was actually done before Wolfenstein Classic, but EA had decided to sit on it until the release of the big PC / console Wolfenstein game in August.\n\nI really thought I was going to go back and finish things up in September, but I got crushingly busy on other fronts.  In an odd little bit of serendipity, after re-immersing myself in the original Doom for the iPhone, I am now working downstairs at Id with the Doom 4 team.  I'm calling my time a 50/50 split between Rage and Doom 4, but the stress doesn't divide.  September was also the month that Armadillo Aerospace flew the level 2 Lunar Lander Challenge:\n\nhttp://www.armadilloaerospace.com/n.x/Armadillo/Home/News?news_id=368\n\nFinally, in October I SWORE I would finish it, and we aimed for a Halloween release.  We got it submitted in plenty of time, but we ran into a couple approval hiccups that caused it to run to the very last minute.  The first was someone incorrectly thinking that the \"Demos\" button that played back recorded demos from the game, was somehow providing demo content for other commercial products, which is prohibited.  The second issue was the use of an iPhone image in the multiplayer button, which we had to make a last minute patch for.\n\n@Release notes@\n\nOk, the game is finally out (the GPL source code is being packaged up for release today).  Based on some review comments, there are a couple clarifications to be made:\n\nMultiplayer requires a WiFi connection that doesn't have UDP port 14666 blocked.  I'm quite happy with the simple and fast multiplayer setup, but it seems like many access points just dump the packets in the trash.  If the multiplayer button on the main menu doesn't start pulsing for additional players after the first player has hit it, you won't be able to connect.  I have also seen a network where the button would pulse, but the player would never get added to the player list, which meant that somehow the DNS packets were getting through, but the app packets weren't.  It works fine on a normal AirPort install...  More on networking below.\n\nI took out tilt-to-turn just to free up some interface screen space, because I didn't know anyone that liked that mode, and my query thread on Touch Arcade didn't turn up people that would miss it a lot. \n\nEvidently there are a few people that do care a lot, so we will cram that back in on the next update.  The functionality is still there without a user interface, so you can enable it by four-finger-tapping to bring up the keyboard and typing \"tiltturn 4000\" or some number like that, and it will stay set.  Make sure you have tiltmove pulled down to 0.  I never got around to putting in a real console, but you can change a few parameters like that, as well as enter all the original doom cheat codes like IDDQD, IDKFA, etc.\n\nI think that the auto-centering control sticks in Doom Classic are a better control scheme than the fixed sticks from Wolf Classic.  The advice for wolf was to adjust the stick positions so that your thumbs naturally fell in the center point, so I just made that automatic for Doom.  Effective control always involved sliding your thumbs on the screen, rather than discretely tapping it, and this mode forces you to do that from the beginning. Still, even if the new mode is some fraction \"better\", there are a lot of people who have logged a lot of hours in Wolfenstein Classic, and any change at all will be a negative initially.  In the options->settings menu screen, there is a button labeled \"Center sticks: ON\" that can be toggled off to keep the sticks fixed in place like in Wolf.\n\nA subtle difference is that the turning sensitivity is now graded so that a given small movement will result in a specific percentage increase in speed, no matter where in the movement range it is.  With linear sensitivity, if you are 10 pixels off from the center and you move your thumb 10 pixels farther, then the speed exactly doubles.  If you are 50 pixels off from the center, the same 10 pixel move only increases your turning rate by 20%.  With ramped sensitivity, you would get a 20% (depending on the sensitivity scale) increase in speed in both cases, which tends to be better for most people.  You can disable this by toggling the \"Ramp turn: ON\" option off.\n\nIn hindsight, I should have had a nice obvious button on the main options screen that said \"Wolfenstein Style\" and had the same options, but I have always had difficult motivating myself to do good backwards compatibility engineering.  Even then, the movement speeds are different between the games, so it wouldn't have felt exactly the same.\n\nIt was a lot of fun to do this project, working on it essentially alone, as a contrast to the big teams on the major internal projects.  I was still quite pleased with how the look and feel of the game holds up after so long, especially the \"base style\" levels.  The \"hell levels\" show their age a lot more, where the designers were really reaching beyond what the technology could effectively provide.\n\n@Future iPhone work@\n\nWe do read all the reviews in the App store, and we do plan on supporting Doom Classic with updates.  Everything is still an experiment for us on the iPhone, and we are learning lessons with each product.  At this point, we do not plan on making free lite versions of future products, since we didn't notice anything worth the effort with Wolfenstein, and other developers have reported similar findings.\n\nWe have two people at Id that are going to be dedicated to iPhone work.  I doubt I will be able to personally open Xcode again for a few months, but I do plan on trying to work out a good touch interface for Quake Classic and the later 6DOF games.  I also very much want to make at least a tech demo that can run media created with a version of our idTech 5 megatexture content creation pipeline.  I'm not sure exactly what game I would like to do with it, so it might be a 500 mb free gee-whiz app...\n\nWolfenstein Classic Platinum was a break-in opportunity for the new internal iPhone developers.  We were originally planning on making the Spear of Destiny levels available as in-app purchased content.  Then we decided to make it a separate \"Platinum Edition\" application at a reasonable price.  Finally, we decided that we would just make it a free update, but something has gone wrong during this process -- people who buy the app for the first time get everything working properly, but many people who upgrade the App from a previous purchase are seeing lots of things horribly broken.  We are working with Apple to try to debug and fix this, but the workaround is to uninstall the app completely, then reload it.  The exciting thing about Wolf Platinum is the support for downloadable levels, which is the beta test for future game capabilities.  Using a URL to specify downloadable content for apps is a very clean way to interface to the game through a web page or email message.\n\nThe idMobile team is finishing up the last of the BREW versions of Doom 2 RPG, and work has started on an iPhone specific version, similar to the Wolfenstein RPG release.  The real-time FPS games are never going to be enjoyable for a lot of people, and the turn based RPG games are pretty neat in many regards.  If they are well received, we will probably bring over the Orcs&Elves games as well.\n\nI want to work on a Rage themed game to coincide with Rage's release, but we don't have a firm direction or team chosen for it.  I was very excited about doing a really-designed-for-the-iPhone first person shooter, but at this point I am positive that I don't have the time available for it.\n\n@Networking techie stuff@\n\nI doubt one customer in ten will actually play a network game of Doom Classic, but it was interesting working on it.\n\nWay back in March when I was first starting the work, I didn't want the game to require 3.0 to run, and I generally try to work with the lowest level interfaces possible for performance critical systems, so I wasn't looking at GameKit for multiplayer.  I was hoping that it was possible to use BSD sockets to allow both WiFi networking on 2.0 devices and WiFi or ad-hoc bluetooth on 3.0 devices.  It turns out that it is possible, but it wasn't documented as such anywhere I could find.\n\nI very much approve of Apple's strategy of layering Obj-C frameworks on top of Unix style C interfaces.  Bonjour is a layer over DNS, and GameKit uses sockets internally.  The only bit of obscure magic that goes on is that the bluetooth IP interface only comes into existence after you have asked DNS to resolve a service that was reported for it.  Given this, there is no getting around using DNS for initial setup. \n\nWith WiFi, you could still use your own broadcast packets to do player finding and stay completely within the base sockets interfaces, and this might even make some sense, considering that there appear to be some WiFi access points that will report a DNS service's existence that your app can't actually talk to.\n\nFor every platform I have done networking on previously, you could pretty much just assume that you had the loopback interface and an Ethernet interface, and you could just use INADDR_ANY for pretty much everything.  Multiple interfaces used to just be an issue for big servers, but the iPhone can have a lot of active interfaces -- loopback, WiFi Ethernet, Bluetooth Ethernet, and several point to point interfaces for the cellular data networks.\n\nAt first, I was excited about the possibility of multiplayer over 3G.  I had been told by someone at Intel that they were seeing ping times of 180 ms on 3G devices, which could certainly be made to work for gaming. \n\nUnfortunately, my tests, here in Dallas at least, show about twice that, which isn't worth fighting.  I'm a bit curious whether they were mistaking one-way times, or if the infrastructure in California is really that much better.  In any case, that made my implementation choice clear -- local link networking only.\n\nA historical curiosity: the very first release of the original Doom game on the PC used broadcast IPX packets for LAN networking.  This seemed logical, because broadcast packets for a network game of N players has a packet count of just N packets on the network each tic, since everyone hears each packet.  The night after we released the game, I was woken up by a call from a college sysadmin yelling at me for crippling their entire network.  I didn't have an unlisted number at the time.  When I had decided to implement network gaming, I bought and read a few books, but I didn't have any practical experience, so I had thought that large networks were done like the books explained, with routers connecting independent segments.  I had no idea that there were many networks with thousands of nodes connected solely by bridges that forwarded all broadcast packets over lower bit rate links.  I quickly changed the networking to have each peer send addressed packets to the other peers.  More traffic on the local segment, but no chance of doing horrible things to bridged networks.\n\nWiFi is different from wired Ethernet in a few ways.  WiFi clients don't actually talk directly to each other, they talk to the access point, which rebroadcasts the packet to the destination, so every packet sent between two WiFi devices is actually at least two packets over the air. \n\nAn ad-hoc WiFi network would have twice the available peer to peer bandwidth and half the packet drop rate that an access point based one does.  Another point is that unlike wired Ethernet, the WiFi link level actually does packet retransmits if the destination doesn't acknowledge receipt.  They won't be retransmitted forever, and the buffer spaces are limited, so it can't be relied upon the way you do TCP, but packet drops are more rare than you would expect.  This also means that there are lots of tiny little ACK packets flying around, which contributes to reduced throughput.  Broadcast packets are in-between -- the broadcast packet is sent from the source to the access point with acknowledgment and retransmits, but since the access point can't know who it is going to, it just fires it out blind a single time.\n\nI experimentally brought the iPhone networking up initially using UDP broadcast packets, but the delivery was incredibly poor.  Very few packets were dropped, but hundreds of milliseconds could sometimes go by with no deliveries, then a huge batch would be delivered all at once.  I thought it might be a policy decision on our congested office access point, but it behaved the same way at my house on a quiet LAN, so I suspect there is an iPhone system software issue.  If I had a bit more time, I would have done comparisons with a WiFi laptop.  I had pretty much planned to use addressed packets anyway, but the broadcast behavior was interesting.\n\nDoom PC was truly peer to peer, and each client transmitted to every other client, for N * (N-1) packets every tic.  It also stalled until valid data had arrived from every other player, so adding more players hurts in two different ways -- more packets = more congestion = more likely to drop each individual packet.  The plus side of an arrangement like this is that it is truly fair, no client has any advantage over any other, even if one or more players are connected by a lower quality link.  Everyone gets the worst common denominator behavior.\n\nI settled on a packet server approach for the iPhone, since someone had to be designated a \"server\" anyway for DNS discovery, and it has the minimum non-broadcast packet count of 2N packets every tic.  Each client sends a command packet to the server each tic, the server combines all of them, then sends an addressed packet back to each client.  The remaining question was what the server should do when it hasn't received an updated command from a client.  When the server refused to send out a packet until it had received data from all clients, there was a lot more variability in the arrival rate.  It could be masked by intentionally adding some latency on each client side, but I found that it plays better to just have the server repeat the last valid command when it hasn't gotten an update.  This does mean that there is a slight performance advantage to being the server, because you will never drop an internal packet.\n\nThe client always stalls until it receives a server packet, there was no way I had the time to develop any latency reducing / drop mitigating prediction mechanisms.  There are a couple full client / server, internet capable versions of Doom available on the PC, but I wanted to work from a more traditional codebase for this project.\n\nSo, I had the game playing well over WiFi, but communication over the Bluetooth interface was significantly worse.  There was an entire frame of additional latency versus WiFi, and the user mode Bluetooth daemon was also sucking up 10% of the CPU.  That would have been livable, but there were regular surges in the packet delivery rate that made it basically unplayable.\n\nSurging implies a buffer somewhere backing up and then draining, and I had seen something similar but less damaging occasionally on WiFi as well, so I wondered if there might be some iPhone system communication going on.  I spent a little while with WireShark trying to see if the occasional latency pileup was due to actual congestion, and what was in the packets, but I couldn't get my Macbook into promiscuous WiFi mode, and I didn't have the time to configure a completely new system.\n\nIn the end, I decided to just cut out the Bluetooth networking and leave it with WiFi.  There was a geek-neatness to having a net game with one client on WiFi and another on Bluetooth, but I wasn't going to have time to wring it all out.\n"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-10-01", "contents": "* EF_ANIM\n* got rid of precache_\n* got rid of SV_Error\n* !!! config strings !!!\n\n+ are lightstyle strings being dynamically freed properly?\n+ pause\n+ remove SV_Error?\n\n!!!move timedemo to server\nshould setmodel take an index?\nsmart precache of weapons?\nlong crawls are annoying\nskin reference counting\ndoes leak test work?\nbad surface extents levels\nmake sound and image names include extensions?\n!!! how to download implicit images ??? !!!\n!!! demo recording with deltas needs to wait for full update !!!\nmake timeout at least a minute?\nmulticast_all_r for configstring should go to connected as well as active\nclients\nstring encode SKY_AXIS and SKY_ROTATE in SKY?\nit will be possible to get an index for an item not yet known\nbecause of reliable / unreliable issues\nblock_until_reliable option?\nsupress flag on HUDs to allow cheap blinking?\nrename \"map\" to \"start\"?\nextra packet dumps still happening on map start\nremove CL_MapEntity\nmove baselines into a parallel array?\ndon't expose svc_tent / muzzle flash numbers to game?\ndropcommand cvar to restart crashed servers?\nbetter box top walk jumping\nfull death cycle for player\ninventory is persistant, per-client state.\nno high step jump out\npain and death animations should be based on impact direction and\ntotal damage in that frame\ncheck on virtual alloc / commit issues\nweird bmodel edge stream problem\nincrease numstacksurfs / numstackedges\nclear sound buffer on loading plaque"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-11-23", "contents": "QuakeWorld: there is one physics problem that is preventing me from releasing: you get stuck sometimes in moving plats.

IBM was talking about getting us a power-PC machine, but I haven't heard back from them in a while. If one shows up, we will compile for that as well.\n\nGLQuake: 3DFX is writing a mini-gl driver that will run glquake. We exepect very high performance. 3Dlabs is also working with me on improving some aspects of their open-GL performance. DynamicPictures sent me an Oxygen board, but glquake did a horrible crash and burn with their beta drivers. They are looking into it. DEC is sending me a powerstorm to work with, which should perform in the same ballpark as the intergraph realizm I did the development work on.\n\nI do expect the 3dfx version to outperform the $5k+ professional gl cards, due to its higher fill rate and the fact that they can tune directly for quake. There are certainly valid reasons to buy $5k cards (24+ bit z buffers, 24 bit color, 1280 res, etc), but don't cry when a $300 card eats their lunch :-).\n\nBecause of the very fill-rate intensive nature of the way I implemented this version of glquake (using a blend pass to do the light maps), performance is not likely to be very good on any current generation consumer level board except 3dfx. The next generation of most vendors cards should have sufficient fill rate, if claims are to be believed. I may do a surface cached version just for the experience, in any case.\n\nOne little public rant: if you are a 3d chip designer, don't even THINK about not supporting true alpha blending. Screen door transparency is not a valid replacement. (this means YOU, matrox!)\n\nIRIX-GLQuake: In two weeks, Ed Hutchins from SGI is coming down and we are going to port glQuake to irix. This will only run (reasonably) on systems with hardware texture mapping: O2, impact, RE2, and IR. No indys, extremes, etc. You could probably use them as dedicated servers, though.\n\nD3DQuake: I started bringing up glquake on direct-3d a couple days ago. We are going to have a very nice, apples-to-apples api comparison here. It takes four times as much code to do anything in D3D as it does in OpenGL, but I will tune both to the best of my abilities and we shall see if there is any performance advantage to either API. We should be able to do comparisons on both 3DFX and 3DLabs hardware with both apis.\n\nQuake utilities: I have split qbsp into two programs: qcsg and qbsp2. The processing is more robust, faster, and more memory frugal, but it currently generates rathar unoptimized maps. I will be writing a seperate map optimizer program soon to get the counts and size back to what they should be. I will probably do a new tool release after we get some more testing time on them. All of the utilities except qbsp now automatically use as many processors as you have if you are running on NT.\n\nNew stuff: The outline of the next generation game engine is beginning to take a bit of shape... I'm applying the lessons learned from quake and I have a long list of new things to try. I want to polish off all the outstanding quake stuff, then just go into hermit mode and work on the future while the other guys do Quake 2."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-09-02", "contents": "I have been getting a lot of requests for commentary on two subjects lately:\n\nNvidia's new geometry accelerated card with the funny name.\n\nIt is fast. Very, very fast. It has the highest fill rate of any card we have ever tested, has improved image quality over TNT2, and it gives timedemo scores 40% faster than the next closest score with extremely raw beta drivers.\n\nThe throughput will definately improve even more as their drivers mature.\n\nFor max framerates in OpenGL games, this card is going to be very hard to beat.\n\nQ3's target of about 10,000 triangles a frame doesn't stress this card at all. If you want more polygons out of Q3, you can do:\n\nr_lodBias -2 // don't use lower detail models \nr_subdivisions 1 // lots more triangles in curves \nr_lodCurveError 10000 // don't drop curve rows for a long time\n\nI haven't looked at the stencil shadow stuff in a long time, but it gives the largest increase in triangle use (and a lot of fill rate as well):\n\ncg_shadows 2 // turn on stencil shadows (if you have a stencil buffer)\n\n\n\nApple's new G4 systems.\n\nThe initial systems are just G4 processors in basically the same systems as the current G3. There will be some speedup in the normal C code from the faster floating point unit, and the Apple OpenGL has AltiVec optimizations, so framerates will improve somewhat. The limiting factor is going to be the fill rate on the rage128 and the bandwidth of the 66mhz pci bus and processor to main memory writes.\n\nThe later G4 systems with the new memory controller and AGP will have better performance, but probably still limited by the new 3D card.\n\nAfter Apple gets all their driver tuning done, it will be interesting to try running timedemos at low resolution to factor the fill rate out. Apple has a shot at having the best non-geometry accelerated throughput, but it will still be tough to overcome a K7 with an extra hundred or so mhz.\n\nOn a purely technical note, AltiVec is more flexible for computation than intel or AMD's extensions (trinary ops), but intel style write combining is better for filling command buffers than the G4's memory streaming operations."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1998-01-11", "contents": "I AM GOING OUT OF TOWN NEXT WEEK, DON'T SEND ME ANY MAIL!\n\nOdds are that I will get back and just flush the 500 messages in my mailbox.\n\nNo, I'm not taking a vacation. Quite the opposite, in fact.\n\nI'm getting a hotel room in a state where I don't know anyone, so I can do a bunch of research with no distractions.\n\nI bought a new computer specifically for this purpose - A Dolch portable pentium-II system. The significant thing is that it has full length PCI slots, so I was able to put an Evans & Sutherland OpenGL accelerator in it (not enough room for an intergraph Realizm, though), and still drive the internal LCD screen. It works out pretty well, but I'm sure there will be conventional laptops with good 3D acceleration available later this year.\n\nThis will be an interesting experiment for me. I have always wondered how much of my time that isn't at peak productivity is a necessary rest break, and how much of it is just wasted.\n\n---\n\nThe client's IP address is now added to the userinfo before calling ClientConnect(), so any IP filtering / banning rules can now be implemented in the game dll. This will also give some of you crazy types the ability to sync up with multiple programs on the client computers outside of Q2 itself.\n\nA new API entry point has been added to the game dll that gets called whenever an \"sv\" command is issued on the server console. This is to allow you to create commands for the server operator to type, as opposed to commands that a client would type (which are defined in g_cmds.c).\n\n---\n\nWe did a bunch of profiling today, and finaly got the information I wanted. We weren't doing anything brain dead stupid in the server, and all of the time was pretty much where I expected it to be.\n\nI did found two things we can pursue for optimization.\n\nA moderately expensive catagorization function is called at both the beginning and end of client movement simulation. With some care, we should be able to avoid the first one most of the time. That alone should be good for a >10% server speedup.\n\nThe other major thing is that the client movement simulation accounted for 60% of the total execution time, and because it was already compartmentalized for client side prediction, it would not be much work to make it thread safe. Unfortunately, it would require MAJOR rework of the server code (and some of the game dll) to allow multiple client commands to run in parallel.\n\nThe potential is there to double the peak load that a server can carry if you have multiple processors. Note that you will definately get more players / system by just running multiple independent servers, rather than trying to get them all into a single large server.\n\nWe are not going to pursue either of these optimizations right now, but they will both be looked at again later.\n\nAll this optimizing of the single server is pushing the tail end of a paradigm. I expect trinity to be able to seamlessly hand off between clustered servers without the client even knowing it happened."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-08-02", "contents": "Here is The New Plan:\n\nI copied off the quake codebase and set about doing some major improvements. The old v1.01 codebase will still be updated to fix bugs with the current version, but I didn't want to hold back from fixing things properly even if it involves some major changes.\n\nI am focusing on the internet play aspect of the game. While I can lay out a grand clean-sheet-of-paper design, I have chosen to pursue something of a limited enough scope that I can expect to start testing it around the end of the month (august). I still have my grand plans for the future, but I want to get some stuff going NOW.\n\nQuakeWorld.\n\nThe code I am developing right now is EXCLUSIVELY for internet play. It will be rolled back into the single player game sometime along the road to Quake 2 (or whatever it turns out to be called), but the experimental QuakeWorld release will consist of seperate programs for the client and the server. They will use the same data as the current registered quake, so the only thing that will be distributed is new executables (they will peacefully coexist with current quake).\n\nThere will be a single master server running here at id. Whenever anyone starts up a server, it will register itself with the master server, and whenever a client wants to start a game, it will inquire with the master to find out which servers are available.\n\nUsers will have a persistant account, and all frags on the entire internet will be logged. I want us to be able to give a global ranking order of everyone playing the game. You should be able to say, \"I am one of the ten best QuakeWorld players in existance\", and have the record to back it up. There are all sorts of other cool stats that we could mine out of the data: greatest frags/minute, longest uninterrupted quake game, cruelest to newbies, etc, etc.\n\nFor the time being, this is just my pet research project. The new exes will only work with registered Quake, so I can justify it as a registration incentive (don't pirate!).\n\nIf it looks feasable, I would like to see internet focused gaming become a justifiable biz direction for us. Its definately cool, but it is uncertain if people can actually make money at it. My halfway thought out proposal for a biz plan is that we let anyone play the game as an anonymous newbie to see if they like it, but to get their name registered and get on the ranking list, they need to pay $10 or so. Newbies would be automatically kicked from servers if a paying customer wants to get on. Sound reasonable?\n\nTechnical improvements.\n\nThe game physics is being reworked to make it faster and more uniform. Currently, a p90 dedicated server is about 50% loaded with eight players. The new network code causes a higher cpu load, so I am trying to at least overbalance that, and maybe make a little headway. A single p6-200 system should be able to run around ten simultanious eight player servers. Multiple servers running on a single machine will work a lot better with the master server automatically dealing with different port adresses behind the client's back.\n\nA couple subtle features are actually going away. The automatic view tilting on slopes and stairs is buggy in v1.01, and over a couple hundred millisecond latancy connection, it doesn't usually start tilting until you are allready on a different surface, so I just ripped it out entirely. A few other non-crucial game behaviors are also being cut in the interest of making the physics easier to match on the client side.\n\nI'm going to do a good chat mode.\n\nServers will have good access control lists. If somebody manages to piss off the entire community, we could even ban them at the master server.\n\nThe big difference is in the net code. While I can remember and justify all of my decisions about networking from DOOM through Quake, the bottom line is that I was working with the wrong basic assumptions for doing a good internet game. My original design was targeted at <200ms connection latencies. People that have a digital connection to the internet through a good provider get a pretty good game experience. Unfortunately, 99% of the world gets on with a slip or ppp connection over a modem, often through a crappy overcrowded ISP. This gives 300+ ms latencies, minimum. Client. User's modem. ISP's modem. Server. ISP's modem. User's modem. Client. God, that sucks.\n\nOk, I made a bad call. I have a T1 to my house, so I just wasn't familliar with PPP life. I'm adressing it now.\n\nThe first move was to scrap the current net code. It was based on a reliable stream as its original primitive (way back in qtest), then was retrofited to have an unreliable sideband to make internet play feasable. It was a big mess, so I took it out and shot it. The new code has the unreliable packet as its basic primitive, and all the complexities that entails is now visible to the main code instead of hidden under the net api. This is A Good Thing. Goodbye phantom unconnected players, messages not getting through, etc.\n\nThe next move was a straightforward attack on latency. The communications channel is not the only thing that contributes to a latent response, and there was some good ground to improve on.\n\nIn a perfect environment, the instant you provided any input (pressed a key, moved a mouse, etc) you would have feedback on the screen (or speaker) from the action.\n\nIn the real world, even single player games have latency.\n\nA typical game loop goes something like: Read user input. Simulate the world. Render a new graphics scene. Repeat.\n\nIf the game is running 15 frames a second, that is 66 ms each frame. The user input will arive at a random point in the frame, so it will be an average of 33 ms before the input is even looked at. The input is then read, and 66 more ms pass before the result is actually displayed to the user, for a total of nearly 100 ms of latency, right on your desktop. (you can even count another 8 ms or so for raster refresh if you want to get picky).\n\nThe best way to adress that latency is to just make the game run faster if possible. If the screen was sized down so that the game ran 25 fps, the latency would be down to 60ms. There are a few other things that can be done to shave a bit more off, like short circuiting some late braeking information (like view angles) directly into the refresh stage, bypassing the simulation stage.\n\nThe bearing that this all has on net play, aside from setting an upper limit on performance, is that the current Quake servers have a similar frame cycle. They had to, to provide -listen server support. Even when you run a dedicated server, the model is still: fetch all input, process the world, send updates out to all clients. The default server framerate is 20 fps (50 ms). You can change this by adjusting the sys_ticrate cvar, but there are problems either way. If you ask for more fps from the server, you may get less latency, but you would almost certainly overcommit the bandwidth of a dialup link, resulting in all sorts of unwanted buffering in the routers and huge multi thousand ms latency times as things unclog (if they ever do).\n\nThe proper way to address this is by changing the server model from a game style loop to a fileserver/database style loop.\n\nInstead of expecting everyone's messages to be dealt with at once, I now deal with each packet as it comes in. That player alone is moved forward in time, and a custom response is sent out in very short order. The rest of the objects in the world are spread out between the incoming packets. There are a lot of issues that that brings up. Time is no longer advancing uniformly for all objects in the world, which can cause a lot of problems.\n\nIt works, though! The average time from a packet ariving at the system to the time a response is sent back is down to under 4ms, as opposed to over 50 with the old dedicated servers.\n\nAnother side benefit is that the server never blindly sends packets out into the void, they must be specifically asked for (note that this is NOT a strict request/reply, because the client is streaming request without waiting for the replies).\n\nI am going to be adding bandwidth estimation to help out modem links. If quake knows that a link is clogged up, it can choose not to send anything else, which is far, far better than letting the network buffer everything up or randomly drop packets. A dialup line can just say \"never send more than 2000 bytes a second in datagrams\", and while the update rate may drop in an overcommited situation, the latency will never pile up like it can with the current version of quake.\n\nThe biggest difference is the addition of client side movement simulation.\n\nI am now allowing the client to guess at the results of the users movement until the authoritative response from the server comes through. This is a biiiig architectural change. The client now needs to know about solidity of objects, friction, gravity, etc. I am sad to see the elegent client-as-terminal setup go away, but I am practical above idealistic.\n\nThe server is still the final word, so the client is allways repredicting it's movement based off of the last known good message from the server.\n\nThere are still a lot of things I need to work out, but the basic results are as hoped for: even playing over a 200+ ms latency link, the player movement feels exactly like you are playing a single player game (under the right circumstances -- you can also get it to act rather weird at the moment).\n\nThe latency isn't gone, though. The client doesn't simulate other objects in the world, so you apear to run a lot closer to doors before they open, and most noticably, projectiles from your weapons seem to come out from where you were, instead of where you are, if you are strafing sideways while you shoot.\n\nAn interesting issue to watch when this gets out is that you won't be able to tell how long the latency to the server is based on your movement, but you will need to lead your opponents differently when shooting at them.\n\nIn a clean sheet of paper redesign, I would try to correct more of the discrepencies, but I think I am going to have a big enough improvement coming out of my current work to make a lot of people very happy."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-09-21", "contents": "* areaportals!!!\n* model contents for moving water\n\n+ use different decompression buffers for pvs and phs?\n+ fix headnode issues\n\nget rid of fat pvs completely?"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-06-13", "contents": "* slider sounds in menu\n* trigger counter's don't require targets now\n* fixed blaster mismatch warning message\n* net start menu\n* enter on full key config clears\n* ogre gib\n* quad damage face\n* quad damage powerup cheat\n* all gib heads\n* removed K_ from key names\n* bind   with no parms reports the current value\n\ncan't give\ntry partical effect for teleporters\nremove forward to server commands, use impulse for all?\nold rule deathmatch option in menu\nhead in wall again\nno cheat in coop\nconnect from demo\nchecksum pak directory for shareware version\nshambler, wizard, ogre, voor heads\nallow arrow key repeats?\nitem respawn on bmodel bug\npitch jerk at startup sometimes.\nstuck heads bug\n\"no messages\" option\naxe weaponframe switch problem\nmake \"dropped datagram\" a developer only printf\nplayer thump for ogre falling?\ncenterprint entering message\nvariable ceterprint wait time\ndouble nightmare attacks\ndisallow new game during multiplayer?\nno player crush to point\nsinking into plats\ncoop through episode end\nallow typing in savegame comment\nfix talk message display code\nkeep commands in doubly linked MRU list to avoid linear scan?\nmultiplayer end of episodes hang?\ncenterview doesn't work in water\nmake sure all menu vars are in default.cfg"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-09-09", "contents": "* freed textures on gl shutdown\n* fixed pitch bounds check merge bug\n* cleanup sound code\n* cut default maxclients\n* cut update_backup\n\n+ soft fullscreen failure on ingr\n+ error not closing window\n+ cds window set on top of taskbar\n+ fullscreen in mode 0, set mode 1 = crash\n+ alt stuck down after alt-tab\n\nfix vis expansion problem\ntrinity: shimmering heat atmospheric effects\nneed a remove command builtin for game logic\nget all texture extension numbers into gl_image\nvis decompression overrun\nwindow doesn't offset in non-fullscreen modes"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-06-07", "contents": "* three levels of gib velocity\n* accumulate damage to allow gibbing with shotguns when powered up\n* radius damage opens secrets\n* get Michael's bmodel lighting code\n* moved notarget check into progs code\n* removed self.running from progs\n* fixed weapon fov nudges, moved super shotgun\n* status bar faces\n* fixed single player loading plaques\n* auto center if on bmodels\n* sound and cd audio have big banners if not configured\n* grunt muzzle flash sync with attack\n* darkened blood\n* dog head\n* moved sound and cd init into non dedicated startup\n* moved message printing to SUB_UseTargets (buttons get messages)\n* moved delay to SUB_UseTargets so all activations can delay\n* trigger_relay entity\n* clear notify and center print when in menu\n* added svs.changelevel_issued to prevent possible double changelevel\n* changed NaN velocity / origin checks to warnings with clear to 0\n\n+ take away stuff in jrstart\n+ player head gib now has wrong view ofs\n+ the tim5 bug\n+ exactly position enforcer bolt launch\n+ status bar faces\n+ save game with powerups\n+ monster target finding with prespawning is messed up\n\nmake activator a parm to use functions instead of a global\nwrite a tool to search all maps for boolean queries on key/value pairs\nreformat console with vid changes\nstart past skill select when returning to jrstart\nconnect to bad map, then to a good map gives no free clients\nlava damage for monsters\nshambler hand lightning\nfade to intermission?\nmeat spray from axe attack\ngamma prob at intermissions\nmake a model fullbright flag for torches\nAdd -safe for nosound, vidmode 0, exec default -nocdaudio, -nonet\nkill zombies with axe\nteamplay totals\ndoesn't auto center if head out of water\neasier jump out of water\ncan't record net demos any more\nsolo status bar in dark font\nkey config names in dark font\nprint savegame comment line on save screen\nare you sure?

Can you explain what some of the\n>major things that should be rendered using a display list are? I see\n>the importance of using them for characters (animation) and objects, but\n>what about using them for the rest of the world, particles, and other\n>things that are nifty.\n\nThis is not yet a big issue, although even pure software OpenGL's could perform some optimizations with display lists that aren't possible with vertex arrays. With hardware geometry acceleration, it can be an honest 4x improvement in throughput.\n\nThe important point is that once geometry acceleration becomes a primary target, practically everything will have to be rendered with display lists, or you will run into a nasty case of Amdahl's law.\n\nIn a busy Q3 battle, the triangle count may be split roughly evenly between character models and world geometry. Going from an empty scene to a pitched battle can result in a 50% performance drop if you are triangle limited. Not great, but livable.\n\nIf we kept the same ratios and designed for geometry acceleration with all the static world geometry in display lists, then the empty scene could have 4x the geometry and still be running the same speed. However, current OpenGL display lists can't really accelerate high quality skinned characters, so when an equal number of character polygons was in scene and passed through normal direct rendering, the performance would drop to 20% of the original. Unacceptable.\n\nSo, either you would have to use significantly different polygon counts in characters and the world, or some new API features would need to be defined. Nvidia has a skinning extension that gives some benefit, but still requires a character to be broken up into one static list per bone pair, instead of a single list for the entire character.\n\nRendering a few thousand particles or other procedurally generated triangles directly isn't going to be a big issue, but the bulk of the work is going to move towards static vertex data.\n\nMy advice for display lists is to use them for just raw vertex/color/texcoord data, and keep your state changes done with direct commands. This allows you to still sort display lists to minimze state changes, and prevents drivers from ever having to check state internally. Some hardware architectures can nicely encapsulate all state changes in a single dma buffer, but register sharing among different fields sometimes requires the driver to do manual masks, negating much of the async display list benefits. Texture swapping also complicates state changes inside display lists.\n\nYou want to make the display lists as big as practical, but there is a tradeoff betwen culling tightness and display list size."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-09-01", "contents": "I have been working on our memory footprint for the past couple days. There are two types of paging that occur:\n\nOne time only paging that eventually settles down after you have run around the entire level a few times. This can be a result of having lots of data around that isn't actively used during the game, or was only used at startup.\n\nTrue capacity misses, where the game is actually touching more memory during play than you have available. This is usually due to there just being too many textures and models.\n\nLoading a large map with full resolution, 32 bit textures and mipmaps consumes almost 40 megs of texture space. The default of picmip 1 and 16 bit textures reduces that to six or seven (not all images observe picmip) in theory, but some OpenGL implementations keep a 32 bit version of the texture around even if the card only uses 16 bit (I consider this inapropriate), so it may still be twelve or more megs just for the images.\n\nI have been able to save a couple megs off of the true capacity requirements by not rolling through some larger buffers when not needed (not smp and not dedicated server), and several megs more of one-time data mostly by moving a lot of static tables to dynamic allocation.\n\nI can probably save another meg of true capacity and I think three or four megs of initialization data. The big thing that I might be forced to do is go to a skeletal animation system. I would hate to do that at this late a point in the project, but it would save about two megs per player model in the game.\n\nIn the process of chasing down the static memory hogs, I finally got around to starting something I have needed to do for years: learn perl.\n\nI was scanning through a linker map file looking for large gaps in addresses, thinking to myself \"this is one of those things you can probably do in three lines of perl code\". I have many and varied excuses for why I have never gotten around to it before, mostly involving the fact that I have C parsing code that lets me get what I need done with only minimal headache when I do force myself to do some text file grovelling.\n\nI decided my excuses weren't good anymore, and went out to the bookstore and grabbed the llama book.

With Quake 2's binary server dll's not all ports could necessarily run a server, but they could all play.\n\nWith significant chunks of code now running on the client side, if we stuck with binary dll's then the less popular systems would find that they could not connect to new servers because the mod code hadn't been ported. I considered having things set up in such a way that client game dll's could be sort of forwards-compatable, where they could always connect and play, but new commands and entity types just might now show up. We could also GPL the game code to force mod authors to release source with the binaries, but that would still be inconvenient to deal with all the porting.\n\nRelated both issues is client side cheating. Certain cheats are easy to do if you can hack the code, so the server will need to verify which code the client is running. With multiple ported versions, it wouldn't be possible to do any binary verification.\n\nIf we were willing to wed ourselves completely to the windows platform, we might have pushed ahead with some attempt at binary verification of dlls, but I ruled that option out. I want QuakeArena running on every platform that has hardware accelerated OpenGL and an internet connection.\n\nThe only real solution to these problems is to use an interpreted language like Quake 1 did. I have reached the conclusion that the benefits of a standard language outweigh the benefits of a custom language for our purposes. I would not go back and extend QC, because that stretches the effort from simply system and interpreter design to include language design, and there is already plenty to do.\n\nI had been working under the assumption that Java was the right way to go, but recently I reached a better conclusion.\n\nThe programming language for QuakeArena mods is interpreted ANSI C. (well, I am dropping the double data type, but otherwise it should be pretty conformant)\n\nThe game will have an interpreter for a virtual RISC-like CPU. This should have a minor speed benefit over a byte-coded, stack based java interpreter. Loads and stores are confined to a preset block of memory, and access to all external system facilities is done with system traps to the main game code, so it is completely secure.\n\nThe tools necessary for building mods will all be freely available: a modified version of LCC and a new program called q3asm. LCC is a wonderful project - a cross platform, cross compiling ANSI C compiler done in under 20K lines of code. Anyone interested in compilers should pick up a copy of \"A retargetable C compiler: design and implementation\" by Fraser and Hanson.\n\nYou can't link against any libraries, so every function must be resolved. Things like strcmp, memcpy, rand, etc. must all be implemented directly. I have code for all the ones I use, but some people may have to modify their coding styles or provide implementations for other functions.\n\nIt is a fair amount of work to restructure all the interfaces to not share pointers between the system and the games, but it is a whole lot easier than porting everything to a new language. The client game code is about 10k lines, and the server game code is about 20k lines.\n\nThe drawback is performance. It will probably perform somewhat like QC. Most of the heavy lifting is still done in the builtin functions for path tracing and world sampling, but you could still hurt yourself by looping over tons of objects every frame. Yes, this does mean more load on servers, but I am making some improvements in other parts that I hope will balance things to about the way Q2 was on previous generation hardware.\n\nThere is also the amusing avenue of writing hand tuned virtual assembly assembly language for critical functions..\n\nI think this is The Right Thing."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-04-29", "contents": "* fixed light sample determination for all rotations and scales\n* pulled wizard shot starts inside bounding box\n* fixed demon jump damage\n* objects never clip against their owner, and vice versa\n* ogre pain frames\n* fix pathcorner bug\n* don't let monsters see into water\n* don't allow dead monsters to be used by triggers\n* reset player's gib head to proper bounding box\n* gib dogs\n* killed avelocity when bounce objects stop\n* toss objects drop with plats now\n* remove progrestart\n* wizard spikes don't fire if dead\n* make wizard drop altitude\n* better stereo seperation\n\n+ check message triggers\n\nalpha qlumpy still has wrong type numbers\nhelp screen?\nauto reload savegame\nadd pak building to qcc\nlet doors target other items\nguys gibbed by boxes go to no such frame?\nis axe view skipping frames?\ndo player pain frames cause weapon frame skipping?\nhighlight current weapon in status bar\ndynamically light bmodels\nswimming motion\nexplosions need to reveal secrets"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-03-20", "contents": "* deathmatch onyl spawn doesn't work\n* drowning damage\n* changed QuakeEd to get progs from id1_\n* added colors to QuakeEd entities\n* got rid of /lquake, moved QuakeEd caches to /qcache\n\n+ don't take datagrams until acked second message\n+ not-dm is intangible\n+ sally torches not spawning\n+ client called twice?\n+ combine damage messages from super shotguns\n+ gib zombies lying down?\n+ more water friction\n+ swimming bubble noise\n+ light the weapons differently in bright areas\n+ keyboard freelook\n+ move QuakeEd start position to playerstart\n\nstop wall climbing\nsleeping pause\nraise rocket launcher with 0 ammo"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-03-08", "contents": "* dropping ammo\n* zombie gib non-solid\n* all zombie attacks\n* scrolling notify text\n* shooters that fire superspikes\n* keys\n* increased monster sight distance\n* fixed noclip in water\n\n+ fix sound code\n+ item only in dm flags\n+ shoot through complex bmodels\n+ NaN stuff\n+ change impulse over to impule # instead of impulse1\n+ dog frames\n+ demos!\n\nfix noclip underwater\nall zombie pain issues\nduplicate impulse events\nstatus bar art needs work\njrbase3 teleporter can be hit behind dmonly\ndo pain well on all monsters\ndon't blit the entire screen when sized down!\nclean up headers"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-04-01", "contents": "* added $flags to models for client side stuff (rotations, trails)\n* allowed coop play\n* started using Host_Error for client errors\n* lint\n\n+ animating textures\n+ NULL connect\n+ connect while in a game crashes\n\ndifferent sfx cache size for client only?\nframe chnaging while paused?\nitem targets\nrespawn in coop"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-04-15", "contents": "* lowered slime cshift\n* wizard slide move\n* dog frames\n* fixed auto aiming when dead on\n* soldier less hp + tuning\n* various gibs\n* dynamically allocated scores structure\n* trigger_counter\n* door TOGGLE\n* fixed forking bug that trashed pointfiles\n* fixed sky fuckup\n\n+ fix demon pop jump\n+ zombie get up inside other\n+ zombie gib throwing\n+ lose onfloor when pushed\n+ animating textures\n+ schurch weirdness\n\nmake light styles global prog vars\nbase4 entrance door sucks\nback attack damage\nfix dynamic light values of players\naim up at nearby monsters\nload pcxs in lbmlib\ntext triggers\nswim slow straight up?\ntemp entities\nclient sound calls\nzombie heads bouncing\nbouncing monsters out of the world\ngib bodies between pushers"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-05-22", "contents": "Bad news.\n\nIt looks like this is when \"unsupported\" really becomes unsupported\n\nGlquake and QuakeWorld were fun to do, but keeping the datasets compatable with quake 1 really has held me back a lot.

Because of the way quake mods work, It has always been possible to have server side cheats along the lines of \"if name == mine, scale damage by 75%\". You have to trust the server operator.\n\nSo, the problem then becomes a matter of making sure the clients are all playing with an acceptable version before allowing them to connect to the server. You obviously can't just ask the client, because if it is hacked it can just tell you what you want to hear. Because of the nature of the GPL, you can't just have a hidden part of the code to do verification.\n\nWhat needs to be done is to create two closed source programs that act as executable loaders / verifiers and communication proxies for the client and server. These would need to be produced for each platform the game runs on. Some modifications will need to be done to the open source code to allow it to (optionally) communicate with these proxies.\n\nThese programs would perform a robust binary digest of the programs they are loading and communicate with their peer in a complex encrypted protocol before allowing the game connection to start. It may be possible to bypass the proxy for normal packets to avoid adding any scheduling or latency issues, but it will need to be involved to some degree to prevent a cheater from hijacking the connection once it is created.\n\nThe server operator would determine which versions of the game are to be allowed to connect to their server if they wish to enforce proxy protection. The part of the community that wants to be competetive will have to agree to some reasonable schedule of adoption of new versions.\n\nNothing in online games is cheat-proof (there is allways the device driver level of things to hack on), but that would actually be more secure than the game as it originally shipped, because hex edited patches wouldn't work any more. Someone could still in theory hack the closed source programs, but that is the same situation everyone was in with the original game.\n\nPeople can start working on this immediately.

I haven't taken the top off the F50 yet, though (its supposed to be a 40 minute job..).\n\nAdjustable front suspension. Press a button and it raises two inches, which means you can actually drive it up into strip malls. The F40 had to be driven into my garage at an angle to keep the front from rubbing. This makes the car actually fairly practical for daily driving.\n\nDrastically better off idle torque. You have to rev the F40 a fair amount to even get it moving, and if you are moving at 2000 rpm in first gear, a honda can pull away from you until it starts making boost at 3500 rpm. The f50 has enough torque that you don't even need to rev to get moving, and it goes quite well by just flooring it after you are moving. No need to wreck a clutch by slipping it out from 4000 rpm.\n\nMuch nicer clutch. The F40 clutch was a very low-tech single disk clutch that required more effort than on my crazy TR with over twice the torque.\n\nBetter rearward visibility. The F40's lexan fastback made everything to your rear a blur.\n\nBetter shifting. A much smoother six speed than the F40's five speed.\n\nBetter suspension. Some bumps that would upset the F40 badly are handled without any problems.\n\nBetter aerodynamics. A flat underbody with tunnels is a good thing if you are going to be moving at very high speeds.\n\nI beleive the F50 could probably lap a road coarse faster than the F40, but in a straight line, the F40 is faster. The F50 felt a fair amount slower, but I was chalking that up to the lack of non-linear turbo rush. Today I drove it down to the dyno and we got real numbers.\n\nIt only made 385 hp at the rear wheels, which is maybe 450 at the crank if you are being generous. The F40 made 415, but that was with the boost cranked up a bit over stock.\n\nWe're going to have to do something about that.\n\nI'm thinking that a mild twin-turbo job will do the trick. Six pounds of boost should get it up to a health 500 hp at the rear wheels, which will keep me happy. I don't want to turn it into a science project like my TR, I just want to make sure it is well out of the range of any normal cars.\n\nI may put that in line after my GTO gets finished."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1999-05-11", "contents": "I am offering a bounty for server crashing bugs.

Towards the end of Quake 1's development I was thinking that we might have been better off splitting quake on those categories, but in reverse order. Doing client/server, the better modification framework, and qc, coupled with a spiced up DOOM engine (Duke style) for one game, then doing the full 3D renderer for the following game.\n\nWe have no reason to believe that the next generation development would somehow go faster than the previous, so there is a real chance that doing all of the Trinity technology at once might push game development time to a full two years for us, which might be a bit more than the pressure-cooker work atmosphere here could handle.\n\nSo, we are going to try an experiment.\n\nThe non-graphics things that I was planning for Trinity will be held off until the following project - much java integration with client downloadable code being one of the more significant aspects. I hope to get to some next generation sound work, but the graphics engine is the only thing I am committing to.\n\nThe graphics engine is going to be hardware accelerated ONLY. NO SOFTWARE RENDERER, and it won't work very well on a lot of current hardware. We understand fully that this is going to significantly cut into our potential customer base, but everyone was tired of working under the constraints of the software renderer. There are still going to be plenty of good quake derived games to play from other developers for people without appropriate hardware.\n\nThere are some specific things that the graphics technology is leveraging that may influence your choice of a 3D accelerator.\n\nAll source artwork is being created and delivered in 24 bit color. An accelerator that can perform all 3D work in 24 bit color will look substantially better than a 16 bit card. You will pay a speed cost for it, though.\n\nMost of the textures are going to be higher resolution. Larger amounts of texture memory will make a bigger difference than it does on Quake 2.\n\nSome key rendering effects require blending modes that some cards don't support.\n\nThe fill rate requirements will be about 50% more than Quake 2, on average. Cards that are fill rate limited will slow down unless you go to a lower resolution.\n\nThe triangle rate requirements will be at least double Quake 2, and scalable to much higher levels of detail on appropriate hardware.\n\nHere are my current GUESSES about how existing cards will perform.\n\nVoodoo 1 Performance will be a little slow, but it should look good and run acceptably. You will have to use somewhat condensed textures to avoid texture thrashing.\n\nVoodoo 2 Should run great. Getting the 12 mb board is probably a good idea if you want to use the high resolution textures. The main rendering mode won't be able to take advantage of the dual TMU the same way quake 2 does, so the extra TMU will be used for slightly higher quality rendering modes instead of greater speed: trilinear / detail texturing, or some full color effects where others get a mono channel.\n\nPermedia 2 Will be completely fill rate bound, so it will basically run 2/3 the speed that quake 2 does. Not very fast. It also doesn't have one of the needed blending modes, so it won't look very good, either. P2 does support 24 bit rendering, but it won't be fast enough to use it.\n\nATI Rage Pro It looks like the rage pro has all the required blending modes, but the jury is still out on the performance.\n\nIntel I740 Should run good with all features, and because all of the textures come out of AGP memory, there will be no texture thrashing at all, even with the full resolution textures.\n\nRendition 2100/2200 The 2100 should run about the speed of a voodoo 1, and the 2200 should be faster. They support all the necessary features, and an 8 mb 2200 should be able to use the high res textures without a problem. The renditions are the only current boards that can do 24 bit rendering with all the features. It will be a bit slow in 24 bit mode, but it will look the best.\n\nPVR PCX2 Probably won't run Quake 3. They don't have ANY of the necessary blending modes, so it can't look correct. Video Logic might decide to rev their minidriver to try to support it, but it is probably futile.\n\nRIVA 128 Riva puts us in a bad position. They are very fast, but they don't support an important feature. We can crutch it up by performing some extra drawing passes, but there is a bit of a quality loss, and it will impact their speed. They will probably be a bit faster than voodoo 1, but not to the degree that they are in Quake 2.\n\nNaturally, the best cards are yet to come (I won't comment on unreleased cards). The graphics engine is being designed to be scalable over the next few YEARS, so it might look like we are shooting a bit high for the first release, but by the time it actually ships, there will be a lot of people with brand new accelerators that won't be properly exploited by any other game."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-12-02", "contents": "A couple things I forgot to mention:\n\nDOOM source. Still planned to be released Real Soon Now, but there is some work that needs to be done on it first to remove the sound engine, which was written by someone else.\n\nOur Quake editor. It will be released with the tools, but it really isn't going to be all that usefull to many people. Most people will be better off with one of the actively supported editors designed for normal machines.\n\nThere is no documentation (Steve Tietze at Rogue has talked about writing something, though). It is designed to run at 1280*1024 resolution on a fast, fully-compliant OpenGL driver. It was designed for high-end boards like intergraph realizm, 3DPro, and Glint boards, but it also runs ok on 8 mb consumer boards like the permedia II and rendition V2200. It will NOT work with voodoo or powerVR. It is unlikely to work with voodoo rush, because of framebuffer size limits, but it might work at a low screen resolution. It might be workable on RIVA cards if they do some fancy work disposing buffers between window renderings (they are a 4mb card, but the textures can stay in AGP memory, so it will almost be enough). I'll work with them if they want to give it a try.\n\nRight now, only 3Dlabs has a full opengl driver on win-95 (and it is a little flaky). All the other cards would require you to run NT. Over the next several months, most of the major vendors should be releasing full OpenGL drivers that work in '95, but there are no firm release dates.\n\nA comment to the people complaining about the release not having Their-Favorite-Feature:\n\nA software project is never, ever completely finished. If you wait until EVERYTHING is done, you won't ship at all.\n\nWould it have been the right thing to delay releasing Quake 1 until I had written the glquake code and the QuakeWorld code? Or we had gotten Paul to build us all new models? Or we had made all new maps that hang together thematically?\n\nIf we had, we would be releasing Quake right about now. It would be a much better game (it would be Quake 2), but all of the enjoyment that everyone has gotten from Quake would have been lost. It would have been the wrong decision.\n\nQuake 2 is great, and it will get better yet after its release.\n\nA reminder about \"John Carmacks\":\n\nAnyone claiming to be me on IRC is lying. I have never been on IRC, and if I ever choose to, I will mention it here first.\n\nIf you get an unsolicited email from \"John Carmack\", the odds are high that it was spoofed.

I tried to set up a \"poster child\" case that would stress the memory subsystem above and beyond any driver or triangle level inefficiencies, but I was unable to get it to ever approach the performance of a GF4.\n\nThe basic hardware support is good, with fragment flexibility better than GF4 (but not as good as ATI 8500), but it just doesn't keep up in raw performance.

During a network game (or internet phone or videoconference), all the packets are just between two addresses, but tons of bandwidth (and corresponding latency) is eaten by sending full headers. Has anyone developed UDP header compression extensions, and if so, how common are they?\n\nOn a lower hardware level, have any modem manufacturers considered optimizing interfaces or protocols for lower packet latency? Once again, if I understand correctly, modem transmission involves a level of packetizing for modulation/protocol/compression work that is underneath the serial interface seen by a computer. Do partially filled buffers sit idle for a time if there isn't a continuous stream of data, or do they immediately flush when a byte failes to clock in? It would be nice to be able to explicitly syncronize with UDP packets, because a realtime game running within bandwidth limits is going to send and receive discrete packets interspersed with idle time, which is not really what modems are optimized for now. I know that modem data compression is generally a bad thing for low latency connections right now, but if the modem could be signaled to flush at UDP boundaries, it would probably become a positive thing. I'm sure there are also things that could be done at the modulation/protocol layer to improve latency at some cost in bandwidth or error rate, but I have no idea if it could be done compatably.\n\nIt would be an interesting point of differentiation for ISP's or modem manufacturers if an \"optimize for games\" checkbox was available somewhere. Even at the os level, a \"max packets buffered\" option would be valuable to keep packets from piling up when bandwidth is overcommited.\n\nComments?"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-03-30", "contents": "+ dynamic lights....\n+ grenade activation size\n+ entnum optimization\n+ make progs use pointers for edicts?\n+ sideways spikes\n\nesc = floating menus, with console option\nremove avelocity?\ntrack down the _SCR_UpdateScreen <cycle 2> [23] from profile\nclean up search path syntax\nfix style lighting on alias models\nmore #ifdef PARANOID"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-03-18", "contents": "* fuxed button triggered delays\n* added classname to light error message\n* demon more damage\n* sounder objects\n* light_switchable\n\n+ grenade proximity explosions\n+ fix jumping off edges\n+ wizard fast shots\n+ target lights for controling them\n+ plat hit on head bug\n+ ambient light\n\nspiral the view when gibbed\nlevel based gravity"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-04-11", "contents": "* fixed damage through walls\n* fixed gibbing downed zombies\n\n+ KEY_SEMICOLON\n\npointing?\nten second max looping sound?\nintegral sound stepping?\nthe damage byte stream is what is causing packet overflows\ndebounce jump\nis there a mouse call to find the number of buttons?\nfix palette after vid change...\ntoo many vid_palette calls\nDON'T FLUSH THE ENTIRE DAMN SCREEN!\nfix snd_next to be snd_none\nchange sys_loadfile to com_loadfile\n\"system is little endien\" message as optional verbose debug\nsometimes shotgun sound doesn't play\ndouble doors independantly closing\nserver speed went back up\nfix auto aiming\nno gun aiming\nno change to grenade launcher\nogre grenades\nzombie gibs\nr_ambient\nfixed angle for grenades when stopped\nclient side shambler lightning\ngravity on corpses pushed into blocking positions\nslime darkness value\nsky time problem\nintegrate dirpack with qcc\ncheck precedence of test directories and pak files\nrocket auto aiming is not working right\namtele2 teleport problem\nno save when dead\nmemory fail to console, not dos\nstill overrun nails"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-04-05", "contents": "+ sound loop points\n\nmulti life / level demos\nprecache_sound return string value\nmake jump buffered edge triggered\nclipping hull lips\nhang after sitting overnight on dos"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-06-14", "contents": "* removed all use of ai_dead in progs\n* fixed nailgun fire order\n* fixed double press to exit intermission\n* fixed sliding dead player bug\n* fix bonus item respawn on dropping plat\n* zombies don't go down again if already on the way down\n* fixed ambient sound looping problem\n* show looping sounds lin soundlist\n* combined rocket impact and explositon damage for reliable gibs\n* fixed stuttering on dropped packets\n* set teleport death size properly\n\neasier gib from rockets for players\ncheck telefrag for multi players stuck\nis sound buffer not being properly cleared?\nmenu sounds\ndissallow some server forward messages\ninternet reliable messages getting backed up?\ncheck for hard packet overflows\nflash items on status bar\nstop using gfx.wad?\npickup rules\nteleport into monsters bug\nchange away from axe bug"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1998-01-02", "contents": "Wired magazine does something that almost no other print magazine we have dealt with does.\n\nThey check the statements they are going to print.\n\nI just got a \"fact check\" questionaire email from wired about an upcoming article, and I recall that they did this last time the did an article about us.\n\nMost of the time when we talk with the press, we try to get them to send us a proof of the article for fact checking.

This will not be a general  release, but only to properly licensed third parties.  That will still  allow me to collect my 100% coverage data, and it will prevent a  single network/computer/software failure from preventing all QuakeWorld play.\n\nQuakeWorld technical addendum:\n\nI am reining in the client side prediction to a fairly minimal amount. It has too many negative effects in different circumstances.  The problem of running away from or in front of your missiles was so bad that I  considered simulating the missiles on the client side, but that is the  second step on a slippery slope.  If just the missiles were simulated,  then a missile would fire through an enemy until the server informed  you it exploded on them.  Then you consider simulating interactions,  but then you have to guess at other player inputs (which is hopeless)...\n\nLesson learned: Simulating 300 ms on the client side in a Quake style  game is just out of the question.  It probably works fine for flight sim  or driving sims, but not in out twitch reaction games.\n\nI am currently using client side simulation to smooth out the beat  frequency interactions between server packet arrival and client frame  times.  In the shipping version of Quake, some latency was introduced  on purpose to keep the displayed frame simulation time between the last  two packets from the server so that the variability in arrival time  could be smoothed out.  In QuakeWorld, I am always starting with the  most current packet, and using simulation to smooth out the variability. This <100ms of client side motion seems to be very manageable, and cuts  out some real latency as well as doing the gueswork.\n\nIt looks like I am going to split the QuakeWorld client into multiple  threads to reduce the avg 1/2 frame latency between input and packet  sending.  This is also a step towards building a multi-threaded Quake  renderer, which will let multi-cpu NT machines render twice as fast. Lets hope the windows thread scheduler is decent...\n\nI have been cutting down the message sizes a bit here and there as  well.  On a modem link, every couple bytes I save translates into a  millisecond of latency saved.

Those don't count.\n\nCrashtest #3 from [iBO]QWhAX0R was a combination of two problems:\n\nThe symptom was disconnecting all clients with an illegible server message. This turned out to be caused by the fact that I was parsing strings out of my net buffers with a MSG_ReadChar() function, and I was checking for EOF as a negative one return value. I had to change this to a MSG_ReadByte() call, because -1 was showing up in the messages, which then caused a parse error because it wasn't really the end of the message.\n\nThe actual root of that issue was code like this:\n[code]\n{\n\tchar buffer[MAX_STRING_CHARS];\n\t...\n\tstrncpy( buffer, input, sizeof(buffer) - 1 );\n\t...\n}\n[/code]\n\nNo buffer overruns are possible, but buffer is not forced to be zero terminated if on the stack. I'm pretty sure this was a result of copy-and-paste code where buffer used to be a static with a guaranteed zero, but it made me find several other places where similar things were happening.\n\nI had started using a Q_strncpyz() function a while ago that guarantees a trailing zero and doesn't require the -1, but it turned out that between code I had written a long time ago, and code that either Cash or Brian had added, there were still a lot of normal strncpy calls around.

We intend to fix any bugs that turn up, improve the speed somewhat, and optimize for internet play in various ways. We will also be making several deathmatch only maps.\n\nDeathmatch in Q2 has gotten a lot of lan testing (Thresh, Redwood, and Vik Long helped quite a bit the last week with tuning), but not much internet testing. There are probably gaping holes in it, but we will address them soon.\n\nThe deathmatch code in the shipping Q2 is also not designed to hold up against malicious users - there is no protection against clients being obnoxious and constantly changing skins, chat flooding, client-side cheating, or whatever.\n\nQ2 does checksum maps on the client side right now, so cheater maps won't work like they do in Q1, but cheater models and skins are still possible. I have some plans to combat that in the point release, but there are a lot of forms of cheating that can be implemented in proxies that are fundamentally not detectable. I can make it very painfully difficult for people to implement such things, but a very clever person with a dissasembler just can't be stopped completely.\n\nThe server code and network protocol should be able to support ultra-large player counts, but I know I need to do some low-level work to get around operating system buffer limits before it will actually work. We will test at least a hundred players in a giant map for the point release, but we won't actually address the issues of making a rational game at that level (chat hierarchies, team spawning, etc). I am very much looking forward to seeing what the user community creates on that foundation.\n\nIt is likely that the point release may have incompatable network protocols and savegames. Fair warning.\n\nQ2 Demo.\n\nAfter the point release, we will be making a new demo release. If you experienced compatability problems with q2test, or were unsatisfied with the quality in some way, you should look at the demo. The final product is much improved.\n\nQ2 Ports.\n\nWe are commited to Win32 Alpha, Linux, irix, and rhapsody in that order. It is likely that a bunch of other ports will come later, but no promises. The presence of hardware-accelerated OpenGL on a platform will improve it's odds a lot. Zoid will probably prioritize Q2 CTF over other ports, so hold off on bugging him about ports for a while.\n\nDevelopment tool release.\n\nI will basically be making publicly available a subset of the directory tree that we will deliver to our licensees. All the utility source code, the game dll source code, and probably some example source media - .map files, artwork, model source, etc.\n\nQ2 mission pack.\n\nMost of the company will be working on a mission pack while Brian and I write tools and technology for trinity.\n\nTrinity.\n\nI am going to rapidly wean myself off of working with quake so I can concentrate fully on new directions.

I am moving back on to Rage for a while, but I expect to be able to finish it up for submission to the App Store next month.\n\nWolfenstein 3D Classic was a quickie project to satisfy my curiosity and test the iPhone waters, but Doom is a more serious effort. In addition to the millions of people with fond memories of the game, there is still an active gaming / development community surrounding the original Doom, and I don't want to disappoint any of them.\n\nOne of the things I love about open sourcing the old games is that Doom has been ported to practically everything with a 32 bit processor, from toasters to supercomputers. We hear from a lot of companies that have moved the old games onto various set top boxes and PDAs, and want licenses to sell them. We generally come to some terms in the five figure range for obscure platforms, but it is always with a bit of a sigh. The game runs, and the demo playbacks look good, but there is a distinct lack of actually caring about the game play itself. Making Doom run on a new platform is only a couple days of work. Making it a really good game on a platform that doesn't have a keyboard and mouse or an excess of processing power is an honest development effort.\n\nTo my surprise, Christian was able to dig up the original high quality source material for the Doom sounds, so we have 22khz 16 bit sound effects instead of the 11khz 8 bit ones from the original game. It turns out that I can barely tell the difference, which is a sign that we made good choices way back then about catering the sounds to the output device. If we were on the fence for any resource limits, I would have considered sticking with the originals, but the current OpenAL mixer code has errors with 8 bit source buffers, so I would have had to convert to 16 bit at load time anyway, and just referencing the high quality source media actually speeds up the load times.\n\nThe music is all stored as mp3, performed on a high quality synthesizer. For Wolf, we used ogg, because that's what was in the Redux codebase that I started with, but I don't have all that CPU performance margin anymore, so it was necessary to use the iPhone's audio decompression hardware through the AudioQueue services. The music is the largest part of the application, but everything else is still well over the 10 meg cellular app transfer limit, so I'm not tempted to try and squeeze it under like we did with Wolfenstein. Maybe being able to get an app over 3G really isn't very important to its success. The fact that people are downloading Myst on the iPhone is heartening -- I have ideas for leveraging our high end idTech-5 content creation pipeline for a future iPhone game, if people will go for a few hundred meg download.\n\nThe toughest question was the artwork. Since Wolf was selling well, I had planned on paying contractors to upscale all the Doom graphics to twice the original resolution. When I pulled all the graphics out and tallied it all up, it looked a lot more marginal than I had expected. There were over two thousand individual pieces of art, and it was over ten megatexels in exactly bounded area, let alone atlas fit or power of two inset. The PVRTC compressed formats would work great for the floors and ceilings, which are all nice 64x64 blocks, but it has issues for both the walls and floors.\n\nPVRTC textures must be power of two and, notably, square. If you want a 256 x 512 texture that needs to repeat in both axis, you need to resample it to 512 x 512 to use PVRTC, which means you lose half your compression benefit and get distorted filter kernels and mip level selections. Even worse, Doom had the concept of composited walls, where a surface was generated by adding, say, a switch texture on top of a wall texture. You can't do that sort of operation with PVRTC images. The clean sheet of paper solution to both problems is to design around textures that the hardware likes and use more geometry where you need to tile or combine them, but Doom wasn't well suited to that approach.\n\nCharacter sprites don't get repeated, so a lot of them can be packed into a nice square 1024 x 1024 texture to minimize waste, but the PVRTC texture formats aren't well suited to sprite graphics. The DXT1 compression format has an exact bit mask for the alpha channel, which is what you want for an application like this. PVRTC treats alpha like any other color channel, so you get coupling between the alpha and color channels that results in partially transparent pixels ringing outside the desired character boundary. It works fine for things like clouds or fireballs, but not so good for character sprites. It looks like it should be possible to get an exact binary mask with the 2 bit PVRTC mode, which could be combined with a 4 bit PVRTC color texture to get a 6 bpp perfectly outlined sprite, but the multitexture performance on the iPhone, even with PVRTC textures, is not fast enough to prevent missing 30 fps when you have a hoard of monsters in front of you.\n\nWe started to do some internal samples of up-scaled artwork to use as reference for getting the contractor quotes, and it just wasn't looking all that spectacular. Doubling the art and smoothing out the edges wasn't buying much. There was certainly a lot of room for improvement, since Doom was designed around a 256 color palette with a limited selection of intensity ramps for lighting, but moving there from the starting point would be tricky. If I went to one of our artists today and asked them to draw a bad-ass Baron of Hell throwing a fireball in a 256 x 256 x 16 bit block, I would get something a LOT better than the original art, but it would look different, not just better.\n\nI was also a little taken aback by some of the backlash against the updated graphics that I put in for Wolf 1.1. I took the walls, guns, and decorative sprites from the Mac version of Wolfenstein, and had Eric use that as source to recreate some similar graphics that weren't present in the Mac version. After release, there were a number of reviews that complained, saying that it \"ruined the classic feel\". I have a couple thoughts abut this: Changing the look on a point release is going to cause some level of complaint, so it is probably a good idea to make any changes from \" classic\" you think you might want in version 1.0. I also believe most of the complaints were due to the view weapons. The original gun artwork wasn't great, but the double-res ones weren't very good either, and they were a bit different looking. I debated with myself a bit about using them at all, and it looks like I probably shouldn't have. I can't see any drawback whatsoever to the double res walls and sprites, since they are in the same style, just better looking when you jam your face up against them.\n\nIn the end, I decided not to do anything with the DOOM source art. With the GPU accelerated filtering and 24 bit lighting it looks a lot better than it ever did, and with floors, ceilings, and lighting you don't seem to notice the low resolution as much as with Wolf.\n\nWith the speed (a solid 30 fps, even in the more aggressive later levels), the audio, the resolution, and the rendering quality, it is Doom as you remember it, which is quite a bit better than it actually was. If you go back and play the original game on a 386 with a sound blaster, you will be surprised at the 15 fps, FM-synth music, \"bathroom tile sized\" 320 x 200 pixels, external network game setup utility, and external keyboard configuration. A lot of people remember it as \"The best game EVER!\", but \"ever\" has sure moved a lot in the last decade!\n\nBefore I actually started coding on the project, I had visions of adding a lot of modern tuned effects to the core gameplay experience. It would certainly stay a sprite-and-sector based game, but there are many things that would be done differently with the benefit of a GPU and the wisdom of hindsight. Once I began actually working on it, it started to look like a bad idea for a number of reasons. I am trying to not be very disruptive in the main codebase, because I want it to stay a part of http://prboom.sourceforge.net/ instead of being another codebase fork. While I can certainly add a bunch of new features fairly quickly, iterating through a lot of user testing and checking for problems across the >100 commercial Doom levels would take a lot longer. There really is value in \" classic\" in this case, and there would be some degree of negative backlash to almost any \"improvements\" I made. There will still be a couple tiny tweaks, but nothing radical is changing in the basic play. It would be fun to take a small team, permanently fork it, and make a \"Doom++\" just for the iPhone, but that wouldn't be the best first move. Maybe later.\n\nThe iPhone interface around the game is all done nicely. Wolf Classic got dinged a bit for the blocky look of the buttons and interface components. I didn't actually see any complaints about the crappy monospace font, but it deserved some. Everything looks good now.\n\nThe initial release will be for OS 2.x, and support multiplayer over WiFi. A later release will be for 3.x only, and support bluetooth multiplayer. I looked into the possibility of 3G multiplayer, but the latencies just aren't good enough -- I see 380 or so pings from my phone to local servers. This was interesting, because I have talked to other hardware vendors that claim 3G latencies of half that. I'm not sure if there are issues with the iPhone, issues with AT&T's network in Dallas, or if the vendor was just mistaken about what they were getting. One anecdotal report is that iPhones work better in Japan than here, so it may be infrastructure.\n\nI will probably have another update later with more technical details about the logic behind the new rendering architecture (rewritten for > 2x the speed of the original prBoom GL renderer), touch control issues, and so on.\n"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-03-27", "contents": "* fixed soundlist\n* explosion through walls doesn't damage\n* monsters don't melee through walls\n* fixed memory trash from restarts\n* changed signon messages to more client requests, removed buffers\n* invisible clip solids\n\n+ wake up monsters through walls\n+ is vid palette setting fixed?\n+ remove up/down movement from non-noclip \n+ entity bsp clipping for shots and monster moves\n+ make QuakeEd center on start position\n+ climb out of water\n+ light switches?\n\nbsp sticking point\nno aim key\ndon't include trigger and clip mip textures in files?"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1996-04-06", "contents": "use PVS to speed line of sight checks?

I will have to wait for some stuff to come out of NDA to provide a more detailed technical analysis.\n\nArchitectural cleverness is all well and good, but if AMD can't keep the clock speed up with intel, they will still fall behind.

I foudn out a few interesting things:\n\nMouse sampling on win95 only happens every 25ms. It doesn't matter if you check the cursor or use DirectInput, the values will only change 40 times a second.\n\nThis means that with normal checking, the mouse control will feel slightly stuttery whenever the framerate is over 20 fps, because on some frames you will be getting one input sample, and on other frames you will be getting two. The difference between two samples and three isn't very noticable, so it isn't much of an issue below 20 fps. Above 40 fps it is a HUGE issue, because the frames will be bobbing between one sample and zero samples.\n\nI knew there were some sampling quantization issues early on, so I added the \"m_filter 1\" variable, but it really wasn't an optimal solution. It averaged together the samples collected at the last two frames, which worked out ok if the framerate stayed consistantly high and you were only averaging together one to three samples, but when the framerate dropped to 10 fps or so, you wound up averaging together a dozen more samples than were really needed, giving the \"rubber stick\" feel to the mouse control.\n\nI now have three modes of mouse control:\n\nin_mouse 1: Mouse control with standard win-32 cursor calls, just like Quake 2.\n\nin_mouse 2: Mouse control using DirectInput to sample the mouse relative counters each frame. This behaves like winquake with -dinput. There isn't a lot of difference between this and 1, but you get a little more precision, and you never run into window clamping issues. If at some point in the future microsoft changes the implementation of DirectInput so that it processes all pending mouse events exactly when the getState call happens, this will be the ideal input mode.\n\nin_mouse 3: Processes DirectInput mouse movement events, and filters the amount of movement over the next 25 milliseconds. This effectively adds about 12 ms of latency to the mouse control, but the movement is smooth and consistant at any variable frame rate. This will be the default for Quake 3, but some people may want the 12ms faster (but rougher) response time of mode 2.\n\nIt takes a pretty intense player to even notice the difference in most cases, but if you have a setup that can run a very consistant 30 fps you will probably apreciate the smoothness. At 60 fps, anyone can tell the difference, but rendering speeds will tend to cause a fair amount of jitter at those rates no matter what the mouse is doing.\n\nDirectInput on WindowsNT does not log mouse events as they happen, but seems to just do a poll when called, so they can't be filtered properly.\n\nKeyboard sampling appears to be millisecond precise on both OS, though.\n\nIn doing this testing, it has become a little bit more tempting to try to put in more leveling optimizations to allow 60 hz framerates on the highest end hardware, but I have always shied away from targeting very high framerates as a goal, because when you miss by a tiny little bit, the drop from 60 to 30 ( 1 to 2 vertical retraces ) fps is extremely noticable.\n\n-\n\nI have also concluded that the networking architecture for Quake 2 was just not the right thing. The interpolating 10 hz server made a lot of animation easier, which fit with the single player focus, but it just wasn't a good thing for internet play.\n\nQuake 3 will have an all new entity communication mechanism that should be solidly better than any previous system. I have some new ideas that go well beyond the previous work that I did on QuakeWorld.\n\nIts tempting to try to roll the new changes back into Quake 2, but a lot of them are pretty fundamental, and I'm sure we would bust a lot of important single player stuff while gutting the network code.\n\n(Yes, we made some direction changes in Quake 3 since the original announcement when it was to be based on the Quake 2 game and networking with just a new graphics engine)"}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1998-01-01", "contents": "Some of the things I have changed recently:\n\n* fixed the cinematics\n* don't clear config after dedicated server\n* don't reallocate sockets unless needed\n* don't process channel packets while connecting\n* rate variable for modem bandwidth choking\n* delta compress client usercmds\n* fixed sound quality changing after intermissions\n* fixed PVS problem when head was directly under solid in GL\n* added r_drawflat and cl_testlights to cheats\n\nThere are a few problems that I am still trying to track down:\n\nWSAEADDRNOTAVAIL errors\nMap versions differ error\nSometimes connecting and seeing messages but not getting in\nDecompression read overrun.\n\nOf course, we don't actually get any of those errors on any of our systems here, so I am having to work remotely with other users to try and fix them, which is a bit tougher.\n\nMy new years resolution is to improve my coding style by bracing all single line statements and consistantly using following caps on multi word variable names.\n\nActually, I am currently trying on the full sun coding style, but I'm not so sure about some of the comment conventions: don't use multiple lines of // comments, and don't use rows of seperating characters in comments.

Each vertex just has an arbitrary weighted list of the bones that influence it. Bones are just 4x3 matricies of floats.\n\nA hierarchial skeleton has some advantages (angles instead of matricies, ability to do IK, etc), but this is a direct and simple replacement for our existing infrastructure that doesn't require any cached state per model instance.\n\nA single .md4 file holds multiple level of detail surface sets, which all share the same bone frames.\n\nIn use, it is exactly like the existing models (interpolate between two frame numbers), it just saves a huge amount of space.\n\nI used perl to generate my test data, and it was definately faster than having a separate msdev open and doing it in C.\n\nI am trying to use parenthesis on all perl functions, but when I type \"print\", my fingers seem to have a flashback to applesoft basic fifteen years ago, and I wind up with bare quotes on prints and parens on everything else...\n\nDoes anyone know if there is an existing msdev syntax coloring file for perl?

"johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-09-24", "contents": "A significant new feature for map development sneaked into Quake 2 this week.\n\nIt has always been a problem with Quake that putting a door in front of a complex area didn't make the scene run any faster, unlike DOOM. In glquake, it actually made it significantly slower as you aproached the door, due to overdraw.\n\nThere was also the related problem that monsters heard sounds through doors even if they were closed.\n\nThis was because the primary culling mechanism used by Quake is the PVS - the Potentially Visible Set. It only knew about anything that you could POTENTIALLY see from your current (rough) position. If a door might open, the PVS would allways contain everything that you could see even if the door was currently closed.\n\nQuake 2 now has a way to allow you to lop off large amounts of the map irrespective of the PVS.\n\nA map is now divided into \"areas\" by \"areaportal\" entities, usually in door frames.\n\nIf the area behind a door is not reachable by any open areaportals, then nothing from that area will be visible or hearable. This helps both rendering speed and network bandwidth. It also give the level designer an easy \"band-aid\" when they have designed an area that is too slow.\n\nNote that the area-reachable test is strictly a topological flood fill, so if there is ANY route to the other side of a door open, you will still be processing the area behind the door, even if there is no real way you could see through the available route.\n\nIf your level has a reasonable number of doors, it will often run at a fair speed without any PVS information at all.\n\nTo use this feature, you create a thin \"func_areaportal\" entity that hides completely inside the door, then target the door at it. Qbsp3 does a bunch of work behind your back that you really don't want to know about. Doors have special logic in the game to open or close the areaportal at the apropriate time.\n\nI chose not to make it an automatic feature of doors for a few reasons:\n\n1) Teamed double or quad doors would not create a single portal across the entire doorway.\n\n2) The areaportal entity can also be used for things like exploding walls. You can even put one just around a corner and trigger it with a field, but it is usually better to just let the PVS take care of corner bends.\n\n3) Complex doors would have created complex (but invisible) area portal brushes, which would have messed up the bsp a bit.\n\nI think this was the very last data file change for quake II, so here is the current external files header for the curious: (4 character tabs)\n\n[code]\n//\n// qfiles.h: quake file formats\n// This file must be identical in the quake and utils directories\n//\n\n/*\n========================================================================\n\n.MD2 triangle model file format\n\n========================================================================\n*/\n\n#define IDALIASHEADER   (('2'<<24)+('P'<<16)+('D'<<8)+'I')\n#define ALIAS_VERSION   8\n\n#define MAX_TRIANGLES   4096\n#define MAX_VERTS       2048\n#define MAX_FRAMES      512\n#define MAX_MD2SKINS    32\n#define MAX_SKINNAME    64\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n    short   s;\n    short   t;\n} dstvert_t;\n\ntypedef struct \n{\n    short   index_xyz[3];\n    short   index_st[3];\n} dtriangle_t;\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n    byte    v[3];

All servers should upgrade to 3.08, but if you gravved the 3.07 earlier today and only play as a client and don't need timedemo, you don't nned to upgrade.\n\n\n** Dec 28, 5:00 PM CST **\n\nNo crashes on any of the servers!\n\nA few comments on some reported problems:\n\nYou have to press the \"attack\" button to respawn in deathmatch now. This allows you to chat and go into the menu. I have got several mails from people that are typing \"kill\" or reconnecting to servers after they die...\n\nOld savegames will NOT work with the patch. Just cheat yourself to aproximately the same place you were before. The game included config files for starting off at each unit. You can exec one of those to get you close, then do \"give\" commands if you want to be more precise. (bigguun.cfg, boss.cfg city.cfg, command.cfg, factory.cfg, hangar.cfg, jail.cfg, mine.cfg, power.cfg, space.cfg, warehouse.cfg).\n\nI think several people are failing to get the gamex86.dll into the baseq2 directory. if \"fov 120\" doesn't change your field of view, the server doesn't have the right gamex86.dll.\n\n\n** Dec 28, 9:30 PM CST **\n\nIf Quake2 is crashing on you after upgrading, it is probably because you still have the gamex86.dll from q2test in your quake2 directory. The latest quake2.exe just started looking in the exe directory as well as the game directory to make debugging easier, and it brought out this problem. You should only have gamex86.dll in baseq2 unless you are doing specific development.\n\nI had a version check in there, but I never bumped the game api version, so it was ineffective.\n\nWe are going to release yet another new version tonight.\n\nThe big news is that the modem connection and level changing problems are fixed.

BFG gibbing crouching people would cause it.\n\nThere are several other fixes in the menu and renderers as well, so everyone should upgrade.\n\nWe are testing with 3.09 on our servers now, but I want to make an incompatable change before releasing:\n\nRight now, any client can send a \"connect\" message to the server and grab a client slot. If they are the wrong version, they will tie that slot up until they time out ot abort the connection process.\n\nI am going to force clients to send their version number with the connection request, so that bad clients will never take up slots.\n\nThat will require everyone to upgrade to 3.09 to play.\n\nI apologize for the flurry of versions, but this was a forced set of releases due to the server attacks, and lots of people are on vacation here. It certainly could have been tested better, but I thought it better to try and get something out ASAP.\n\nCheck back in the morning for a new version...\n\nBTW, we will release the new gamex86 source code after we are convinced that we aren't going to be making another patch for a couple weeks."}, {"by": "johnc@idsoftware.com", "time": "2002-06-27", "contents": "More graphics card notes:\n\nI need to apologize to Matrox - their implementation of hardware displacement mapping is NOT quad based. I was thinking about a certain other companies proposed approach. Matrox's implementation actually looks quite good, so even if we don't use it because of the geometry amplification issues, I think it will serve the noble purpose of killing dead any proposal to implement a quad based solution.\n\nI got a 3Dlabs P10 card in last week, and yesterday I put it through its paces. Because my time is fairly over committed, first impressions often determine how much work I devote to a given card. I didn't speak to ATI for months after they gave me a beta 8500 board last year with drivers that rendered the console incorrectly. :)\n\nI was duly impressed when the P10 just popped right up with full functional support for both the fallback ARB_ extension path (without specular highlights), and the NV10 NVidia register combiners path. I only saw two issues that were at all incorrect in any of our data, and one of them is debatable. They don't support NV_vertex_program_1_1, which I use for the NV20 path, and when I hacked my programs back to 1.0 support for testing, an issue did show up, but still, this is the best showing from a new board from any company other than Nvidia.\n\nIt is too early to tell what the performance is going to be like, because they don't yet support a vertex object extension, so the CPU is hand feeding all the vertex data to the card at the moment. It was faster than I expected for those circumstances.\n\nGiven the good first impression, I was willing to go ahead and write a new back end that would let the card do the entire Doom interaction rendering in a single pass. The most expedient sounding option was to just use the Nvidia extensions that they implement, NV_vertex_program and NV_register_combiners, with seven texture units instead of the four available on GF3/GF4. Instead, I decided to try using the prototype OpenGL 2.0 extensions they provide.\n\nThe implementation went very smoothly, but I did run into the limits of their current prototype compiler before the full feature set could be implemented. I like it a lot. I am really looking forward to doing research work with this programming model after the compiler matures a bit. While the shading languages are the most critical aspects, and can be broken out as extensions to current OpenGL, there are a lot of other subtle-but-important things that are addressed in the full OpenGL 2.0 proposal.\n\nI am now committed to supporting an OpenGL 2.0 renderer for Doom through all the spec evolutions. If anything, I have been somewhat remiss in not pushing the issues as hard as I could with all the vendors. Now really is the critical time to start nailing things down, and the decisions may stay with us for ten years.\n\nA GL2 driver won't give any theoretical advantage over the current back ends optimized for cards with 7+ texture capability, but future research work will almost certainly be moving away from the lower level coding practices, and if some new vendor pops up (say, Rendition back from the dead) with a next-gen card, I would strongly urge them to implement GL2 instead of proprietary extensions.\n\nI have not done a detailed comparison with Cg. There are a half dozen C-like graphics languages floating around, and honestly, I don't think there is a hell of a lot of usability difference between them at the syntax level. They are all a whole lot better than the current interfaces we are using, so I hope syntax quibbles don't get too religious. It won't be too long before all real work is done in one of these, and developers that stick with the lower level interfaces will be regarded like people that write all-assembly PC applications today. (I get some amusement from the all-assembly crowd, and it can be impressive, but it is certainly not effective)\n\nI do need to get up on a soapbox for a long discourse about why the upcoming high level languages MUST NOT have fixed, queried resource limits if they are going to reach their full potential. I will go into a lot of detail when I get a chance, but drivers must have the right and responsibility to multipass arbitrarily complex inputs to hardware with smaller limits.

It's\npretty obvious from their numbers that the Rendition is pretty much fill\nlimited whereas the NVidia is host-limited.  This is good news for NVidia since\nthis means that tweaking their drivers will hopefully increase their numbers\nacross the board.\n\nJust for grins I ran the Rendition V2200 at 1024x768....I'm impressed that it\nworks at all, but I don't think people are going to be playing at that\nresolution with that performance anytime soon.\n\nAnd for those of you that are curious, the ATI Rage Pro 8MB MCD got 10.8 fps\nat 640x480 using their MCD on the Pentium II/200.  I'd have a hard time\nrecommending the ATI Rage Pro for Quake2 to anyone, unless you're going to be\nrunning in software.  I suppose it would be adequate if you had one already,\nwere running NT 4.0, and were willing to run at a low resolution.  I'm not\nsure what kind of performance gains they could realize with an ICD, but\noverall, I'd have to recommend just about any of the other boards we've\ntested over the Rage Pro.  HOWEVER, the Rage Pro does seem to have reasonable\nfeatures, so performance seems to be their primary killer more than anything\nelse.\n\nI'd also like to take the time to thank the hardware vendors that have been\nvery helpful by providing frequent driver updates, supporting OpenGL\npublically, and by providing as many loaner boards as possible.  These\ncompanies include 3Dfx, NVidia, STB (specifically Chris Cox, who constantly\nprovides us with tons of testing boards -- dude, you're the Man!), Texas\nInstruments (they provide us most of our Permedia2 boards), Rendition, and\nNEC/PowerVR.\n\nDecember 14, 1997\n------------------\n\nOkay, the questions have already started rolling in.  Some more data and\ncommentary for you:\n\n- \"SLI\" means \"scan-line interleaved\", i.e. two Voodoo (or Voodoo2) chipsets\nrunning in parallel, each of which is processing every other scan line.  You\ncan do this in a single board configuration (such as the Obsidian 100-4440)\nor you can do this with two boards connected by some ribbon cable.  Currently\nno consumer Voodoo boards support SLI out of the box, but supposedly Voodoo2\nboards WILL support SLI out of the box.\n\n- currently there is a throughput problem with the Voodoo2.  Well, it's not\nreally a \"problem\", it's more like a bottleneck at around 67fps, which is very\nhard to classify as a \"problem\".  This means that having a Voodoo2 in an SLI\nconfiguration doesn't make much sense unless you want to run fast high\nresolution modes like 800x600.  Currently there is no significant difference\nin performance between an SLI and non-SLI Voodoo2 configuration when runnning\nat 640x480 or lower.  HOWEVER, if it turns out that they're artificially\nlimited in throughput (poor drivers, early silicon, low-speed parts, whatever)\nthen there is a chance that the SLI will make a difference -- although I have\nno idea why you'd need to run > 60fps.\n\nOne possible explanation for the throughput problems is that Glide 2.x does not\nsupport strips and fans, and we rely on those heavily.  If Glide 3.x supports\nstrips and fans (and their OpenGL supports this) then throughput could nearly\ndouble since it will utilize the Voodoo2's on-board triangle setup engine very\neffectively.\n\n- the 2D card used with the PCX2 was an NVidia RIVA128 PCI.\n\n- I have no idea what the pricing is going to be for Voodoo2, other than it is\ntargeted at consumers, meaning that it probably won't cost thousands of\ndollars.\n\n- I have no idea when Voodoo2 will ship, so this may all be moot if they can't\nthis thing out the door on time.\n\n- the RIVA128 still has lots of room for improvement, and I'm sure that with\nappropriate driver optimizations that they are going to get quite a bit\nfaster.\n\nDecember 13, 1997 (part 2)\n------------------\n\nEvery now and then a beast walks the landscape and devours all within its path,\nknowing no natural enemy.  These are the things of legend: Michael Jordan,\nWalter Payton, the great white shark, early Mike Tyson, and...\n\n3DFX, ca. 1997\n\nI've said this before and I'll say it again -- I left 3Dfx for a reason, and\nit didn't have anything to do with wanting to branch out and expand my\nhorizons.  It had to do with the fact that I thought 3Dfx was confused and had\na severe lack of management and direction.  So when I say good things about\n3Dfx, it's not because I love that company or anything -- sure, I have some\nstock in 3Dfx, but the amount I have is a pittance (I negotiated poorly for\nstock, and I left after only 1/4 of it vested), so I don't have a financial\nreason to like 3Dfx.\n\nIf I say good things about 3Dfx, it's because their hardware rocks like no\nother hardware company can dream of.  I empathize with their situation --\nthey make what is  arguably the single most important piece of consumer PC\nhardware since the SoundBlaster, and all we keep hearing about are all the\n\"Voodoo Killers\" that are gonna show up \"any day now\".  I cannot stress to\nthe world what kind of an amazing achievement the Voodoo was/is -- it easily\nspanked it's nearest competitor by a factor of three, which is practically\nunheard of.  Typically when looking at performance claims between hardware\nit's impressive to see someone listed as \"25% faster\".  But THREE HUNDRED\nPERCENT?!\n\nThat, my friends, is amazing.  And yet at times I STILL think people are\nconstantly looking at the horizon wondering what's going to be the \"Voodoo\nKilla\", instead of appreciating the magnitude of what Scott Sellers, Gary\nTarolli, and Jim Margeson accomplished.\n\nid had to hear the same noise after Quake when all the \"Quake killers\" were\ngonna show up and even the landscape....sure, there were pretty screenshots\nand big performance claims and projected release dates, but when it came down\nto it, the first Quake killer to ship was...Quake 2.\n\nIt must be nice being a competitor of 3Dfx, since it's easy to aim for that\nplume of dust they're leaving in their trail.\n\n\"So, what's the big deal?\" you may ask.  Why the big 3Dfx Cheerleading all of\na sudden?\n\nTo answer that, let's just say \"I ran the numbers\".  But first, let us\nestablish some things:\n\n1.  The test system, as I mentioned the other day, is a pretty big, macked\nout, p1mped up system from hell.  It's an HP Pavilion 8190 Pentium 2/300 with\nAGP, 6GB HDD, some kind of soundcard (disabled for testing), etc. etc.  A\npretty nice system.  Oh, and 96MB of RAM.\n\n2.  Now, please do NOT send me mail whining that this system is not indicative\nof what everyone has.  I KNOW this already.  But if I test on a Pentium/200MMX,\npeople are gonna complain that they don't know what kind of p1mped out new\nsystem to get, or they'll complain that my test system should match our\nminimum requirements.  If I test on a P5/133, people are gonna complain, once\nagain, that they don't know what kind of NEW system to get, or they'll complain\nthat I'm testing CPU performance, not hardware performance.\n\n3.  Yes, certain accelerators are very dependent on CPU performance.  If I had\na P5/133, I would NOT get a PowerVR or a RIVA128 -- these two chipsets are\nreal dependent on CPU performance, more so than their competitors.\n\n4.  A Pentium 2 was pretty much needed because I wanted to test AGP parts along\nwith PCI parts.  Also, some chips like the RIVA128 are going out standard on a\nlot of Pentium 2 machines, so NVidia will have a (valid) argument that if I\ntest a RIVA on a P90 that this is NOT typical of a RIVA in the field.\n\nSo, I know I can't make everyone else happy, but I CAN make myself happy.  I'm\nsure other people will run the benchmarks on lower end systems and print their\nresults, so all is not lost.\n\n5.  These numbers, and chipset opinions, are GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE\nOF GLQUAKE.  This may seem like common sense, but I KNOW some people are going\nto whine that the numbers are lower than GLQUAKE's, so please...don't.  Also,\nthe performance dependencies of Quake2 are significantly different than that of\nGLQuake -- we have lots more triangles going on, and I believe a lot more\ntextures.  This means that boards that work great with GLQuake (e.g. PowerVR\nPCX2) aren't so hot with Quake2, and vice versa (Permedia2 is arguably a better\nboard for Quake2 than Quake because its triangle setup performance makes up for\nits poor fill-rate).\n\nTests were run 640x480 and 512x384, fullscreen, at 16bpp resolution, with\nsound disabled, using \"sync to retrace\" disabled if at all possible.  Tests\nwere run twice, and the best of the two scores was recorded.  I did not get\na chance to test the ATI Rage Pro because I don't have NT installed -- all\nthe more reason to see these guys support an ICD -- and I did not get a\nchance to test the Rendition V2100 boards since they don't seem to work with\nthe V2200 software Rendition provided.  I used DEMOMAP DEMO1.DM2 to run\nthe test.  I also did not exec ANY configs, since this can throw off figures\nif you inadvertently set \"hand 2\" or something.  All tests were performed\nunder Win95 OSR 2.1 with no other applications running.  Occasionally I would\nrun a test at higher resolution \"just because\".\n\nAs a \"control\" number I ran the test in software, fullscreen, using DirectDraw\non the Permedia2.\n\nNo overclocking of any type was done, and I did not run any \"tweaks\".  I'm\ntrying to represent the type of performance Joe User would get if he bought his\nsystem at CompUSA, grabbed some add-in board (if necessary), then went home\nand played.\n\n****************************************************\n* sorted alphabetically

town, the current one just\ngot a lot meaner.  Sure, the Voodoo2 4/4/4 SLI board isn't going to be that\ncommon -- but if you can afford one, you'll have performance at 1024x768 at\nalmost DOUBLE the nearest 3Dfx competitor's performance at 512x384.\n\nHow ya like them apples?\n\nAlright now, this is how this is gonna work.  First, all the news pages are\ngoing to post links, and eventually this plan file will be forwarded to all\nthe appropriate people at all the various hardware companies.  All the people\nthat are going to end up looking bad are going to bitch at me because of\nunfair comparisons, I didn't run on a slower machine, etc.  All the people\nthat are looking good are going to end up bitching at me because I didn't\nmake them look better.  Everyone is going to have nit picky gripes about\nmiscellaneous crap, including, I'm sure:\n\n\"we run faster in a window\"\n\"we run faster fullscreen\"\n\"we're scalable\" (i.e. we need a faster CPU)\n\"they're CPU dependent\" (i.e. they suck on slower CPUs)\n\"we support 24-bit\"\n\"they don't support 24-bit\"\n\"we have [insert feature here]\"\n\"we have better image quality\"\n\"you're using their beta drivers\"\n\"you're not using our beta drivers\"\n\n---------------------------------\n3Dfx Voodoo\n---------------------------------\nimage quality:\t\t\tgood (identical to Voodoo)\nperformance:\t\t\tvery good\nprice/performance:\t\tgood\nWinNT support:\t\t\tyes\nfull OpenGL ICD:\t\tno\n\nnotes:\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again -- look at the scores, and realize\njust how long ago this chipset shipped.  I'm still in awe.\n\nI didn't have a 4/2/2 so that I could run at 800x600.  When I get that I will\ntoss it into the mix.\n\nThe Canopus didn't show any significant performance increase, but this is\nbecause I'm measuring OVERALL performance, and I'm NOT measuring transient\nspikes in performance (i.e. stuttering).  We're looking into ways of measuring\nframerate consistency in addition to measuring average framerate.  The Canopus\nis still definitely a better board than the Monster3D -- that extra 2MB will\ngo a long way towards smoothing framerate, unfortunately that's simply not\ngoing to be quantified up very well under a TIMEDEMO benchmark.\n\nThat Quantum3D had decent performance, but definitely not enough to justify\nthe price.

Notice\nthat going to SLI doesn't really buy you that much except higher resolutions --\nthey have so much fill rate that they are limited by throughput almost\ncompletely across the board.  On a the uber-Voodoo2 (4/4/4 SLI) there pretty\nmuch isn't a difference in performance when running from 512x385 to 1024x768.\n\n---------------------------------\n3Dfx Voodoo Rush\n---------------------------------\nimage quality:\t\t\tgood (identical to Voodoo)\nperformance:\t\t\tokay\nprice/performance:\t\tpoor\nWinNT support:\t\t\tno\nfull OpenGL ICD:\t\tno\n\nnotes:\n\nSetting gl_swapinterval did not result in any visible tearing, so either it is\nbeing ignored or they are triple buffering automatically (which would be cool).\n\n---------------------------------\n3DLabs Permedia2\n---------------------------------\nimage quality:\t\t\tpoor (no MIP-mapping, no colored lighting)\nperformance:\t\t\tokay\nprice/performance:\t\taverage\nWinNT support:\t\t\tyes\nfull OpenGL ICD:\t\tyes\n\nnotes:\n\nThis board is perfectly adequate for games and level editing, although it\nwon't excel at either.

I couldn't get 800x600 to work, but\nwhen I do I will put that number in -- I'll probably run a lot of these\ntests at 800x600 just to be complete.\n\n---------------------------------\nRendition V2200\n---------------------------------\nimage quality:\t\t\tgood (no per-pixel MIP mapping)\nperformance:\t\t\tgood\nprice/performance:\t\tgood\nWinNT support:\t\t\tyes\nfull OpenGL ICD:\t\tyes\n\nDammit, Rendition, when are you gonna ship this puppy?!  I am emphatically\nenthusiastic about this chipset, it's got great performance, and it's a fully\nintegrated part that does 3D-in-a-window really well.  It looks great, has\nawesome image quality, a full feature set (except for per-pixel MIP mapping),\nand in general just rocks.\n\nThese numbers are probably a little lower than they should be, since it looked\nlike syncing to vertical retrace was enabled and I don't know how to disable\nsync on the V2200.\n\nBut it ain't shipped yet. *sigh*\n\nDecember 13, 1997\n------------------\n\nDamn! Found a crappy bug with our GL_EXT_SWAPINTERVAL handling.  I have a chunk\nof code that basically does this:\n\nif ( gl_swapinterval->modified )\n{\n   UpdateSwapIntervalInTheDriver();\n   gl_swapinterval->modified = false;\n}\n\nThis works fine, until someone changes the video mode -- this causes the entire\nOpenGL DLL to be unloaded, and when it's reloaded the swapinterval isn't set\nappropriately, so if I ever did this:\n\n]gl_swapinterval 0\n]gl_mode 2\n\nThe value of \"gl_swapinterval\" would not be set after the mode switch.  Irk.\n\nI'm extremely glad I found this bug though, otherwise all my numbers on 3Dfx\nwould have been suspect.  Whew.\n\nAny IHVs that have NOT implemented the swapinterval extension -- I'm BEGGING\nyou to!  Please, it REALLY makes benchmarking a lot easier.\n\nDecember 12, 1997 (part 2)\n------------------\n\nDidn't get much done today, spent most of today messing around with a brand\nnew HP Pavilion 8190 system.  Man, a few years ago computers like this simply\ndidn't exist -- fast, well built, well designed, easy to setup, and cheap.  It\ncomes with a big fat color poster showing how to put it together, and it has\nEVERYTHING included -- Pentium II 300MHz, 32MB RAM, fax/modem, ATI Rage Pro w/\n4MB of RAM (AGP), 6GB IDE HDD, the works.  And it cost $2700 w/o monitor.  Oh,\nit also has a DVD-ROM 2x driver, and it includes a nice set of Polk Audio\nspeakers with a subwoofer.  Dig this -- the keyboard has CD-player controls\non it, and you can hook up the modem so that your computer does voice mail and\nacts as a speakerphone.  Wow.\n\nThe only thing missing was a network card, which was easily rectified by\nslapping an Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 PCI in there.  It took me over an\nhour to figure out that it was the \"B\" model, not the \"A\" or \"C\" model, and\nafter that it was on the network.  The system only has Win95 OSR 2.1 installed,\nand I'm not going to risk angering the Gods of Computer Moodiness by installing\nWindows NT on it -- so no MCD scores (the only losses here will be Intel i740\nscores -- which we're not allowed to print anyway, and ATI Rage Pro MCD scores)\nbut this isn't that big a deal, since MCD is officially dead-ola.\n\nSo I stick in the Rendition V2200, and it finally came up and worked like a\ncharm, and damn does it look GOOD.  Fast, good quality output, no glitches,\nno problems.  People are gonna dig it.  The PCX2, unfortunately, installed\nokay, but PVRGL.DLL wasn't loading. *sigh*\n\nTests are going to be 640x480x16bpp, fullscreen only.  Benchmarking takes up\nWAY too much time, and as much as I'd like to get scores for P5/133, P5/200MMX,\nPPro/200, and P2/300, I only have time to do one system, and that's gonna\nbe the high end.\n\nHere's the justification: I realize that the vast majority of users out there\nhave lower end systems, but right now I'm trying to figure out which GRAPHICS\nACCELERATOR is the best, not which SYSTEM is the best.  We all know that some\naccelerators are simply going to fall apart on low end systems -- the RIVA128\nand PCX2 both come to mind, since they are both heavily CPU limited.  But the\nfact is I want to determine what is the BEST Quake2 accelerator out there, and\nthat means removing the CPU as a measuring parameter.\n\nSo tomorrow I'm going to try and finish out all the scores and write something\nup.  Tonight I got V2200 and RIVA128 numbers, tomorrow I hope to do...well,\neverything else.\n\nDecember 12, 1997\n------------------\n\nCyrix sent word to us that we were apparently NOT keeping the system in\n24-bit precision all the time (they also pointed out a bug where I was\nsetting the FP control word to 807f instead of 087f...whoops).  So anyway\nI investigate this somewhat, and find that for some reason every time we\ncall LoadLibrary that the FP control word gets reset to 027f!  What's up\nwith that?  I'm not ruling out a bug on my end, but there's nothing\nobviously screwed up on our end, so maybe this is some known behaviour of\nLoadLibrary?\n\nWill investigate more.\n\nDecember 11, 1997 (part 3)\n------------------\n\nI will probably write up my lecture at UF and post it, so if you live in\nBurkina Faso (or Alabama, same thing :-) ) you don't have to drive all\nthe way to see what mindless crap I ended up sputtering.\n\nA reminder: it will likely NOT be a technical discussion, it's going to\ncover mostly stuff about having a career in the computer industry.  At\nthe end there will be a QA session where we can talk tech if you want, but\nthe actual \"Brian Standing In Front of a Crowd and Rambling\" portion is NOT\ngoing to discuss coding, optimization, graphics, or anything like that (other\nthan the parts that pertain to being successful).\n\nThink of it as a Tony Robbin's speech given by some half-Asian dude who works\nat id software.\n\nToday's Soundgarden lyrics:\n\n\"Down in the hole,\n Jesus tries to crack a smile,\n beneath another shovel load\"\n\nAnecdotal Rambling: The VAX\n\nLet me tell you about a pseudo-online subculture that existed before the\nWeb was invented.  It was called \"The VAX\", and it resided in CSE 211 at the\nUniversity of Florida.  It was a big ol' mainframe running DEC's multi-user\noperating system, VMS (5.4 if I recall), and you logged into it through one\nof a bunch of VT-220 terminals sitting in a HUGE computer room.  This was\nback when computers were networked using ArcNet, and the other half of the\nlab consisted of IBM PC XT machines with dual 5.25\" floppy drives.\n\nThere was actually more than one VAX -- there were MAPLE, PINE, ELM, and\nCEDAR.  But you only logged onto anything but MAPLE in the direst of\nemergencies since the other systems were so damn slow.  Any student with\na valid ID could get a user account and 300 blocks of disk space (I think\na block was 512 bytes, but I don't remember now).\n\nI messed around with the VAX quite a bit, learning some C programming, and\nI also learned a bit of DCL, a REXX-like scripting language.  But the\ninteresting thing about the VAX was that it had a complete subculture of\npeople with nicknames, process names, message boards, and utilities like\nICQ (\"send\") and IRC (\"phone\").  These people were, invariably, freaks, and\nI was one of them.  The people that inhabited this system included SORROW,\nLIONESS, WINTERMUTE, SCRIB, CENOBITE, TIPMO, ENTERPRISE, JIAN, PETRA, RABBIT,\nINFINITY, TRUFFLE, and a host of others.  You could log in and run a command\nto see who was logged in and on what terminal (\"J-11\" would be someone on the\n11th terminal on Row J) and, if you were hard up, you could see if that person\nwas a chick and if they were hot, and if so, you could start anonymously\nsending them messages to get to know them.  You could set your self into\n\"nobroadcast\" mode, meaning that people would not be able to send you a\nmessage, and you could also set your process name to some message that\nestablished how cool and deep you were.\n\nPathetic, I know, but that's computer culture for you.\n\nUnfortunately, there just wasn't a whole lot to do on the VAX.  You could talk\nwith others, but most of the time these were people that were sitting two rows\naway from you, so what was the point?  I used the VAX to learn programming and\nalso because it was located centrally to all the classes that I was busy\nnot attending. :-) It was also nice to send e-mail from the VAX -- this was\nback in 1990 when e-mail hadn't really become the ubiquitous thing it is today,\nso most of the time you ended up sending e-mail to people two seats away, but\nhey, it was pretty cool anyway.\n\nIt was from a VAX account that I sent my very first e-mail to Michael Abrash\nas an id groupie.  Heh heh.\n\nOther VAXers would use it for its telnet capabilities to get into MUDs and\nMOOs; some would use it to telnet to the big IBM mainframe (NERDC) on campus\nor to the Unix workstations upstairs; yet others used it for FTP and GOPHER.\n\nThe other interesting thing is that most of the VAXers were NOT hardcore\ncomputer freaks -- they were mostly people using it for social reasons, not\nbecause they were programmers.  The REAL hackers were hanging out on the third\nfloor using Sun 3/60 and Sun 3/80 machines and, if you were REAL cool, a\nSun SparcStation (\"lightning\" was the first one UF received, if I remember\ncorrectly).  See, REAL computer users used SunOS (and thought Solaris was the\nspawn of Satan).  The VAX was for rejects that didn't have the clout to get\na Unix account...heh.\n\nI'll tell you, I really miss the good old days, back in college when you had\nfew responsibilities but to pass the occasional class and mostly hang out\nwith friends.  I used to hang out with my friends Oz and Taco until 6AM\nwatching movies we'd seen a million times before.  We'd drink, party, talk\nabout each other behind each other's backs, fall in love with each other's\ngirlfriends, do stupid shit like that, and That Was Cool, because it was\na part of growing up.  When your only responsibility was to survive until the\nnext day and, hopefully, not get thrown out of school.  This was the brackish\ntime between being a kid and being an adult -- being old enough to really\nreally screw up, but young enough to recover.  Old enough to live away from\nthe parents, but young enough that you didn't have big car payments or\nmortgage payments and it was really a trauma if your folks didn't pay for\nyour car insurance.  Back when you were trying to create your own identity,\nbut had the safety of your bedroom back \"home\" in case you created something\nthat sucked.  Back when you were busy proving to each other that you really\nwere independent, not just living away from home.\n\nThen one day you grow up, and \"home\" ISN'T where your parents are, and your\nold bedroom is now your Mom's den that has their new computer.  You find\nout that you have mortgage and car payments, and you actually make Big Life\nDecisions without even thinking about asking your parents approval.  You move\nacross the continent without telling anyone or asking permission, and you\nsuddenly have responsibilities.  You now have a job where if you screw up\nand don't finish your work you actually GET IN TROUBLE, as opposed to just\nfailing and signing up for a new one by filling out the appropriate bubble\nsheet.\n\nThen one day it's no longer a big deal when you can buy booze, because everyone\ncan tell you're over 21, then the next day you realize you're closer to 30 than\nyou are to 20, and that punks in the mall don't even see you because you're\nAn Adult now instead of One of Them.  People call you sir, and when you're smart\nand successful it's expected instead of \"Oh wow, you are gonna go far someday\",\nbecause you're now old enough where if you haven't made it, you may never make\nit.  You soon reach the point where you're no longer full of potential --\nyou're either a loser or you're not.\n\nGrowing up sounds fun when you're younger, but I'd give it all up to be back\nin school, broke and not giving a shit, staring at the universe around me in\namazement and awe.\n\nChrist, alright, didn't mean to get all morose there....\n\n"}, {"by": "strife@rogue-ent.com", "time": "1996-03-06", "contents": "[rogue-ent.com]\nLogin name: strife    \t\t\tIn real life: Strife by Rogue Entertainment\nDirectory: /Users/strife            \tShell: /bin/csh\nNever logged in.\nProject: http://doomgate.cs.buffalo.edu/games/strife\nPlan:\n6 MAR 96\n---------\nTech Notes for those who've asked:\n\tStrife will run under the same operating systems as Doom2.\n\tRuns just fine under Windows 95!  no tweaking needed!\n\n\tBut we don't recommend you try to Deathmatch under Windows!\n\nSTRIFE is a role-playing oriented action game by Rogue Entertainment Inc.\nIt uses an improved version of Doom's excellent engine to bring\nyou an RPG style world.  the levels are seamlessly integrated to\nrepresent a single world of connected maps. you can go back to the town\nagain and again to buy more ammo from the merchant.  or whatever.\n\nStrife-  An action / R.P.G. where medieval and high technologies combine to\nform a world where warfare and oppression are a way of life.

We've\nrecieved a early box copy and it looks good.\n\nThere is an updater for a few items that didn't make it into the first\nCD printing, check the Velocity and Rogue web sites for it. It's\navailable right now, and updates Strife to version 1.2.\n\nWe've revised the system requirements a little, which may or may not be\nup to date on the various web sites. The current minimum is a 486DX2/66,\nwith 8MB of free memory. The full install on your hard drive is\nabout 60-70 MB. You can run a smaller install, if you're still in the\nstone age (like some of us), that only takes up about 35MB.\n\nStrife runs fine under Windows 95, but you had better have at least a\n16MB machine. Strife really wants about 7-8MB of FREE memory that it\ncan use. You can physically run it on an 8MB machine under windows,\nbut it will page like a monster, and will run like garbage.\n\nWe are currently evaluating developing ports of Strife to other platforms.\n\n---------\n\nThe Strife Demo is available on the internet at ftp.cdrom.com in\nthe /pub/idgames/misc directory.\n\nVisit the Strife/Rogue Web pages at:\nhttp://www.velocitygames.com/\n\nVisit Rogue's Web page at:\nhttp://www.gamers.org/~rogue/\n"}, {"by": "bear@idsoftware.com", "time": "1997-03-24", "contents": "[idsoftware.com]\nLogin name: bear                        In real life: Barrett Alexander\nDirectory: /raid/nardo/bear             Shell: /bin/csh\nLast login Mon Mar 24 19:15 on ttyp5 from inthewoods\nPlan:\n\nA fingering we will go!\n\nYou've fingered Barrett Alexander at id Software, Inc.\n\n===============================================================================\nMarch 22, 1997\n\nGarland Police really suck, you'd think they'd have crimes to prevent or some-\nthing.  In my opinion, of course.\n\n===============================================================================\nMarch 21, 1997\n\nOne thing i need to clear up, Christian is currently employed by his father's\ncompany, Compuroute Computer Services, Inc., and is not a direct employee of\nid Software.  We hire his company, and thus he ends up working under contract\nfor us.  Just thought i'd let everyone know.\n\nI was just sitting in my office, minding my own business, when something\nsuddenly struck me, and i though i'd share that with you also.  It's my humble\nopion that some of the current immagration laws are really backwards and\nscrewed up.\n\n===============================================================================\nMarch 20, 1997\n\nWell, i got many requests for the legal notices i mentioned tuesday.  So, if\nyou wish to do this, we'd appreciate it:\n\n\"QUAKE(r) is a registered trademark of Id Software, Inc.  QUAKE(r), the\nstylized reproduction of the QUAKE(r) trademark, including, without limitation,\nthe Q in QUAKE(r),  and the images depicted in QUAKE(r) are the copyrighted\nproperty of Id Software, Inc.\"\n\nAlso, i was reading what i wrote last night, and noticed that my explaination\nwasn't really as good as it could be.  In a nutshell, the law would not protect\nus if we do not actively attempt to make sure people have permission to use our\ntrademarked/copyrighted materials.  A lawyer can simply say \"see here your\nhonor, they knew people where not giving them legal credit, yet they did noth-\ning\".  By doing that we would be showing a history of 'waiving our rights' to\nour logos and other property, and thus we would loose the battle.\n\nThanks to everyone who wrote and said 'hey, i want to put the legals up'!\n\n===============================================================================\nMarch 18, 1997\n\nWell, as i mentioned previously it's been forever since i updated my .plan.\nJust wanted to take a bit of time to comment on a couple of things:\n\n1.  I received several e-mails and phone calls from reporters regarding all\nthe different changes (primarily personnel leaving), and what effect this has\nhad on id.  Well, frankly, in today's society, people don't stay at one place\nas long as they used to.  Thems is the facts.  So, when people leave, you\njust have to find new ones, and hope that they work.  We have an amazing set of\ntalanted people here at id, and we truly feel that because of this, the next\ngame we release will be our best to date.  Essentially, what i'm trying to say\nis, the team here is as strong as ever, and the atmosphere here is tremendous.\n\n2.  I would like to clarify something about a message that Todd (our CEO) was\nsending to the people in charge of all of the Quake/id related Web Sites.\nEssentially, we are attempting to get everyone who uses our trademarked/copy-\nrighted materials, to put a simple legal notice that states that our assets\nare the property of id, and that they are used under our permission.  Well,\nmy PR firm calls me a few weeks ago and says that word is out that id is\n'bashing' the web people for using our stuff.  This is simply horseshit.  We\nMUST protect our assets and we were just asking nicely if the web masters\nwould put a small legal notice up, that's all, not extorting money from them\nor telling them we were going to sue them or anything like that.  Anyway,\nif we don't actively take a position of concern about our things, then when\nsome company comes along, and truly does outright exploit our stuff (that's a\nnice way of saying steal or attempt to screw us ;), then we don't have a legal\nleg to stand on.  This is the case because the legal system looks at it as if\nwe just stood by while letting everyone use our stuff, not doing anything.\nThe court doesn't particularly care whether it's someone using your property\nfor goodi or not, only that the owner didn't make an effort to protect it.\n\nSo, that's the deal with the legal notice thing, it's just to protect us from\nbeing hosed in the future, not to get shitty with the web sites, we _totally_\napprectiate the attention that so many people give our products.\n\n3.  Christian, Xian, Disruptor, damn glad he's here.  I was at the brink of\ndrowning, and we are psyched to have him on board, he is a great asset, very\ntalented.  Also should mention that we have a new level designer named Paul\nJaquays (pronounced Paul, oh shit, that's the easy name, pronounced\n'jake-ways').  He's another 'older fella', at 40 (i think he said he was 40).\nAnyway, i guess that just means more seasoned gamers on the team, and he's\nbeen around the gaming industry for many years.  We're glad to get both of\nthem!\n\n\n===============================================================================\nFeb 18, 1997\n\n. . . Ok, ok, so i got side tracked.

Personally, i believe that the\nperson with the most amount of time spent in a map deserves credit.\n\nAnd about the latest Daikatana ads in the magazines: sorry if i offended\nyour tender sensibilities by telling you i'm gonna make you my bitch. :)\n\n\nDecember 11, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nI want to update on 2 important topics that just\nhappened to coincide within days of each other.\n\n-----------------\nTopic #1: Quake 2\n\nBefore i say anything, you simply MUST go out and\nbuy yourself a copy of Quake 2, a Monster 3D\nvideo card and a P200 (just in case you have a\nslower system :)\n\nI was pretty skeptical of the Q2Demo that was\nreleased last month, mostly because of the 10hz\ninput problem and the fact that the sound fx\nwere pretty bad.  Of course, i'm not going to\nupdate my .plan to tell everyone that i didn't\nlike the demo.  We're all pretty .plan political\nthese days. :)\n\nBut as soon as Quake 2 was released i ran out\nand bought some copies, put on the headphones,\nturned out the lights, set the GL mode and\nset forth on my long journey...\n\nOh my god.\n\nQuake 2 is the most impressive game i've ever\nplayed on a computer.\n\nMind you, i have a different viewpoint than\nanyone out there. Some people have argued this\npoint with me, saying that DOOM definitely had\na more profound impact than Quake 2.  I never\ngot to see DOOM spring forth from the nether\nregions of the internet, seemingly out of\nnowhere, like everyone else on the planet.\nTherefore, it couldn't have as profound an\neffect on me.\n\nQuake 2's graphics are simply amazing. The\ncolored lighting MAKES this game.  If you're\nplaying the game in software (non-GL), no WAY\nis Q2 going to blow you completely away.\n[I'm so excited to get Daikatana running under\nthe Q2 engine!  We have the source code right\nnow and preliminary tests look awesome!]\n\nI've heard some negative discussion on the Net\nregarding the CD music, but i TOTALLY LOVE IT!\nPlaying Q2 with the music really gets your\nadrenaline pumping!  I wish i knew the names\nof the songs, because my favorite song is\ntrack 6.  Wow.  I'm a guitar junkie, hardcore.\n\nI'm a map designer at heart and the levels in\nQuake 2 are the most beautifully architected\nalternate realities i've ever experienced.\nThey are so much better than Quake 1's maps\nthat i'm almost embarassed to see my earlier\nwork and say that it's still good. The\nmajority of the maps were created by Tim Willits,\nthe lead designer on the project.  Tim did\n22 of the maps and had a hand in the other\n17 maps that were created by American, Brandon,\nJaquays and Xian.  Awesome work, Tim!\n\nThe level textures, models and animations\ndone by Adrian, Kevin and Steed are just\namazing and really create a cohesive, dark\nmood throughout the entire game.  No other\ncompany has thus far matched id's trademark\ngrungy, dark, hardcore art style.\n\nQ2 deathmatch rules.  The weapon balance is\nso much better than Q1.  id definitely copied\nDOOM in this area (among other areas) and the\nresults are magnificent.  No more Q1 deathmatch\nfor me -- Q2 all the way, baby.  (Although\ni think the rocket launcher should have a\nlarger radius of damage and go a slight bit\nfaster.  And maybe a better sound effect.  Ok,\ni'm being nit-picky. :)\n\nI've already beaten the game and am going to\ndo it all over again this weekend.  This is\ndefinitely not something i do with every game,\nbut when you are profoundly affected by a\ngame like Quake 2, you want to experience it\nall over again.  Then maybe once more.\n\nAfter you play Quake 2, you need to ask yourself\nthis question, especially if you are a super-\ncritical 3D shooter nitpicker:\n\nWhat game have you played lately that was\nbetter than Quake 2?\n\nI predict the answer is none.\n\n------------\nSome of you out there may be interested in this\ninformation, so here's a list of the Quake 2 maps\nand who created them.

So much time\nspent inside that world, so much energy\nexpended on the creation of data for DOOM and\nthe destruction of opponents in deathmatch.\n\nEven this long after DOOM's release, there is\nan active community that continues to support\nthe game.  Daily news updates, new levels\nbeing created, new graphics, music and sprites\nare still being made to extend DOOM beyond\nanything we ever imagined.\n\nThere's a lot of interesting information on\nDOOM out there that a lot of you may have never\nseen, such as the very first screenshots of DOOM\nthat i ever released, the earliest pirated\nalphas of the game, the infamous leaked beta,\netc.  Lots of stuff has accumulated and now is\na good time to check it out.\n\nI've picked a few sites to represent them all\nbecause they seem to have the most interesting\ninformation out there on DOOM.\n\nFunctional Entropy:\nhttp://entropy.telefragged.com/index2.html\n(great site, even though they aren't excited\nabout any of Ion Storm's games...yet)\n\nArcane DOOM Stuff:\nhttp://www.trailerpark.com/tequila/killough/doom.html\n(Awesome historical information!)\n\nWith the imminent release of the DOOM source\ncode, a flurry of activity in the DOOM scene is\ntaking place.  After GLDOOM is completed, people\nwill once again inhabit the world of DOOM on\nthe latest 3D video hardware and perhaps inspire\nsome to relive the experience all over again...\n\nLong live DOOM!\n\n\nNovember 11, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nYep, got beat down last night by Joey in DOOM II.\nNaTaS was training him and he did a great job,\nbut tonight Joey is going to be facing his very\nworst fears up close and personal when we go at\nit again.\n\nJust got my Wild Arms soundtrack CD -- sounds\npretty awesome!\n\nCurrently reading Rendevous With Rama.\n\n\nNovember 10, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nYou know a movie is a big success when you have\nhalf your company breaking into discussion/arguing\ngroups for a few hours immediately after returning\nfrom the local Cinemark.\n\nMy opinion: Starship Troopers rocks the house down,\nhardcore!  Sure, the plot is a loaf and the acting\nis passable, but who cares?  Every movie that you\ngo to has decent acting and interesting plots. What\ndoes ST have that all other movies don't have?\n\nHardcore FX and hardcore action.  This movie is a\nperfect personification of DOOM -- it's the blunt,\nexplosive, manic experience of the movie that really\nblows you away.  Not some amazing plot or breakthrough\nacting by a newcomer vying for an Oscar.  It's a\nbone-breaking, badass action thrillfest.  When\nsomeone dies, the camera doesn't pan away at the\nlast minute -- it zeros in on the death and shows\nit in all its gory glory!  GIBFEST!\n\nJust the way I like it.  This entire movie is all\nabout the action and FX, nothing else.  And the FX\nare the best I've ever seen, period.\n\nThe movie that I'm waiting for that I expect to\nhave a lot of integrity in its plot, acting and FX\nis Alien Resurrection.  I expect Aliens+.  But\nwith Starship Troopers, I wasn't expecting much\nbut instead got blown away, hardcore.\n\n\nNovember 3, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nThe Frag was cool.  A bunch of guys took some time\nout and came over to Ion Storm to play some hardcore\nDOOM II deathmatch for a few hours (Blue, Joost,\nOneThumb, etc.)  Very fun.\n\nAbout the AoE review: since I'm not a \"realtime\nstrategy nut\", I guess you shouldn't take my advice\nunless you keep your head in first-person shooters.\nAt least that's what Steve Bauman at Strategy Plus\nthinks.  HE should know a good RTS, not me.\n\nBTW: I've never been paid to endorse anything.  My\nendorsements came from my believing that the product\nwas good.  I don't use a WingMan Warrior, but it's\na good thing for people who can't play simultaneously\nwith a keyboard and mouse.  I like AoE, not because\nI'm friends with Ensemble, but because Bruce Shelley\n(and to a lesser extent, Sandy Peterson) created a\nvery well-balanced Warcraft2/Civ-style RTS game.\n\nHad my \"description\" changed.  I didn't set it that\nway in the first place, MIS did.\n\n\nNovember 1, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nI'm sorry and embarassed about the .plan war that\nhappened yesterday.  We should never have responded\nto Paul's latest update and I offer my apologies\nto the great gaming community that had to sit and\nwatch their favorite game companies act like children.\n\nThis should not happen again.  I have the utmost\nrespect for John Carmack, Adrian Carmack, Kevin\nCloud and the other people who worked long and hard\non Quake 2.  I know that people's perception of\na company is partly based on the .plan file updates\nand I don't want anyone thinking that Ion Storm\nis of low quality based on low quality .plan info.\n\nI can't wait to play Quake 2.  Ship it!\n\n\nSeptember 23, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nI have never been a realtime strategy nut, I'm mostly\na first-person action hardcore gamer.  I played C&C\na little bit last year, but I wasn't really impressed\ntoo much with it and didn't really pursue checking\nout any other \"hot\" RTS titles.\n\nI just played the beta of Age of Empires and it is\na truly awesome game.  Sure, you start out picking\nberries, farming, chopping down trees, etc.  But when\nyou build your civilization up to the point where you\nenter a new age (Tool Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age), it's\nawesome how much more you can do.  This game does\ncivilization development and warfare (land & sea) very\nwell.  There are numerous multiplayer options and a\nscenario editor is included, written by our very own\nMickey Kawick.  The CD music is very cool as well.\nJust playing the title track makes me want to start\nup a new game and destroy someone's civilization!\nGo out and buy Age of Empires from Microsoft,\ndeveloped by our buds over at Ensemble Studios here\nin Dallas.\n\nCheck out this review:\nhttp://www.ogr.com/previews/age_of_empires.shtml\n\n!! Beware The Romero Factor !!\n\n\nMay 31, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nMan, i'm moving my .plan over to html pretty soon. :)\n\nDaikatana has the exact same type of randomized spawn\nspots that Q2 will have: find all spots where the least\namount of people are and pick a random one of those\nfound.  Note that picking up your backpack after you\nrespawn is only cool if your killer is nowhere near it,\nwhich is about 5% of the time.  Thus, uncool.\n\n\nMay 12, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nGot the Froginator animating and it looks really\nexcellent!  It's the first model that we have\nproperly animated in the game so far.\n\n\nMay 7, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nWhoa, long break away from updating the .plan!\n\nDaikatana is rocking along very well, the E3 demo\nis gonna be really cool.\n\nI'm a bit disappointed that Hexen 2 is being\nnamed just that.  I thought that Hecatomb would\nhave been a really great name and carried the\nnaming convention of the series to a logical end.\nDoesn't this sound great: Heretic, Hexen, Hecatomb?\nHeretic, Hexen, Hexen 2.  Whatever. :(\n\n\nApril 2, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nThat was a great April Fool's joke yesterday, eh?\nNo WAY is Onethumb working here! HA HA HA HA HA!\n\n\nApril 1, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nI've had a great idea for another game i'd like\nto develop and i've asked OneThumb, who is a\ngreat idea guy, to head up the project with me\nas Executive Producer.  It's in a different\ngenre than our other games and is going to rock!\n\n\nMarch 31, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nWent muddin' in my brand-new fly-yellow Hummer.\nScared some dudes on the Dallas Tollway, i think.\n\n\nMarch 28, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nWhoa.  I didn't feel *too* sorry for Carmack after\nhearing that his F40 got tapped by a truck since\nhe left a massively expensive Ferrari parked outside\nall day.  But after i found out the extent of the\ndamage and how much it will cost to fix, i now\nfeel pretty bad.  I would hate to have to pay for\nthat amount of random damage.  That does suck.\n\n\nMarch 25, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nThe F40 got hit. Carma.\n\n\nMarch 24, 1997\n------------------------------------------------\nThe only stuff left to create are all the\nartifacts.  The design doc should be done Friday.\n\nThe www-book Halcyon Days is finished.

It uses converted\nDOOM maps and runs them with flats for textures. It looks REALLY\ncool.\nOk, imagine this. You have a health thing and you don't need it.\nYou meet someone in the game who has a nice weapon but is really\nlow on health. You guys decide to exchange items. You don't really\ntrust this guy so you bring along a friend and tell him to hide out\nsomewhere with a bead on the other guy's head. You meet somewhere\nin the middle of a field and face off. You drop your health, he drops\nhis weapon and you both strafe over the object of your desire. You\nstart to back away (not turning your back on him) and suddenly decide\nyou're going to whack this guy before he gets a chance to use that\nhealth. You move towards him and draw back with your hammer. He notices\nthis and starts to duck, but it's too late. You smash him in the head\nand watch him fly down to the ground, landing on his side. You smash\nhis still body a few more times and cause him to explode! Now you and\nyour friend pick up all of the items your dead friend left on the\nground. As you are walking off you pick up his severed head and put\nit in a bag. That will come in useful later... when you need something\nto sacrifice to a demon.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ to help@idsoftware.com\n_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_\n\nWHAT IS iD?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

Set up a Quake server on\na DOS, NeXT, Linux, or SGI etc... box. Once the server is running you\nget on another machine (DOS, NeXT, Linux, SGI, etc) and log into the\nserver. A play window opens and you can see the other players, move\naround, quit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but\nthis will be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc,\nwill be added in later.\n\nBasic Engine:\nThis is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,\nbut this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single\nplayer.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the\nengine.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200\npolygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we\nwould need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail\nwe want. So far this is the only \"thing\" in the game. He does not\nanimate, but it is still cool to watch him be \"born\". At the moment\nhe is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.\n\nMap Editor:\nJohn also has a map editor in the works. At this point it looks\nsomewhat like 3D studio, with a camera view and a top down view\nof the thing you are working on. You can add and subtract blocks\nof \"material\" from the view. These are the building blocks of the\nworld... No, you will not be limited to blocks in the finished game.\n\n**We will not be adding anything new to this for a while.\nThere are MANY cool new things going into the game right now, but\nwe do not want to give it all away just yet. We have been creating\nsmall test levels for the past few weeks, and these are looking\nawesome. The general game idea has started to solidify, but please\ndo not write asking what it is.\nI will add some new stuff here when there is *alot* more to add.\n\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nWHAT IS id?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

It uses converted\nDOOM maps and runs them with flats for textures. It looks REALLY\ncool.\nOk, imagine this. You have a health thing and you don't need it.\nYou meet someone in the game who has a nice weapon but is really\nlow on health. You guys decide to exchange items. You don't really \ntrust this guy so you bring along a friend and tell him to hide out\nsomewhere with a bead on the other guy's head. You meet somewhere\nin the middle of a field and face off. You drop your health, he drops\nhis weapon and you both strafe over the object of your desire. You\nstart to back away (not turning your back on him) and suddenly decide\nyou're going to whack this guy before he gets a chance to use that\nhealth. You move towards him and draw back with your hammer. He notices\nthis and starts to duck, but it's too late. You smash him in the head\nand watch him fly down to the ground, landing on his side. You smash\nhis still body a few more times and cause him to explode! Now you and\nyour friend pick up all of the items your dead friend left on the\nground. As you are walking off you pick up his severed head and put\nit in a bag. That will come in useful later... when you need something\nto sacrifice to a demon.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ to help@idsoftware.com\n_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_\n\nWHAT IS iD?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

It just slows us down.\nThanks.\n\nWell, we just got sprite 'models' animating with frame changes and rotational\nchanges totally moved over to the client. The server is runnin' really well\nnow!  There's a really cool Pain Barrier (and Health Field) that just looks\ngreat with animating and rotating sprites. Um, and yes, there are sprites in\nthe game - for very good reason: there's not an amazing level of detail to\nbe had in a total polygon environment.  Sprites are faster to render and\nbesides, they make great torch holders!  They also look cool for magical\neffects!\n\nProgramming the entities in the game is one of the most amazing and\nrewarding parts of Quake development.  You program in Quake-C (.qc) and the\ninstant you save your file, you tell Quake to reload and compile it. It\ntakes about 1 second.  Then, you get to see your changes implemented right\nthen - and that's while you're programming in a C-like language! No compiler\nin the middle; instant execution.  Too cool for words.\n\nThere. I just wanted to add something new for QuakeTalk. :)\n\n****\nYou can find screenshots of some of our Quake stuff\non ftp.idsoftware.com in /idstuff/quake.

Set up a Quake server on\na DOS, NeXT, Linux, or SGI etc... box. Once the server is running you\nget on another machine (DOS, NeXT, Linux, SGI, etc) and log into the\nserver. A play window opens and you can see the other players, move\naround, quit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but\nthis will be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc,\nwill be added in later.\n\nBasic Engine:\nThis is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,\nbut this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single\nplayer.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the\nengine.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200\npolygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we\nwould need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail\nwe want. So far this is the only \"thing\" in the game. He does not\nanimate, but it is still cool to watch him be \"born\". At the moment\nhe is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.\n\nMap Editor:\nJohn also has a map editor in the works. At this point it looks\nsomewhat like 3D studio, with a camera view and a top down view\nof the thing you are working on. You can add and subtract blocks\nof \"material\" from the view. These are the building blocks of the\nworld... No, you will not be limited to blocks in the finished game.\n\n**We will not be adding anything new to this for a while.\nThere are MANY cool new things going into the game right now, but\nwe do not want to give it all away just yet. We have been creating\nsmall test levels for the past few weeks, and these are looking\nawesome. The general game idea has started to solidify, but please\ndo not write asking what it is.\nI will add some new stuff here when there is *alot* more to add.\n\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nWHAT IS id?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

It uses converted\nDOOM maps and runs them with flats for textures. It looks REALLY\ncool.\nOk, imagine this. You have a health thing and you don't need it.\nYou meet someone in the game who has a nice weapon but is really\nlow on health. You guys decide to exchange items. You don't really \ntrust this guy so you bring along a friend and tell him to hide out\nsomewhere with a bead on the other guy's head. You meet somewhere\nin the middle of a field and face off. You drop your health, he drops\nhis weapon and you both strafe over the object of your desire. You\nstart to back away (not turning your back on him) and suddenly decide\nyou're going to whack this guy before he gets a chance to use that\nhealth. You move towards him and draw back with your hammer. He notices\nthis and starts to duck, but it's too late. You smash him in the head\nand watch him fly down to the ground, landing on his side. You smash\nhis still body a few more times and cause him to explode! Now you and\nyour friend pick up all of the items your dead friend left on the\nground. As you are walking off you pick up his severed head and put\nit in a bag. That will come in useful later... when you need something\nto sacrifice to a demon.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ to help@idsoftware.com\n_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_\n\nWHAT IS iD?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

Deathmatch is working a little\nnow and we can run around and shoot each other with fireballs.\n\nEngine:\nThis is running very fast.

You run across the Morph Ovum and pick\nit up. You let your \"friend\" follow you a little longer and then you\nturn around and use the Morph on him... Four little \"eggs\" fly out\nand a few hit him. He squawks and hits the floor as a chicken.\nNow he has no weapon (except that wimpy beak) and all you have to do\nis catch him, pop him with your Dragon Claw a few times and watch\nthe feathers fly. You've never seen your friends so mad at being\nkilled by you until you turn them into a chicken and make them\ndie in a puff of feathers hehe... The game should be out in two weeks.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStatus of QUAKE---Updated: Fri, Dec 2nd 2:20pm\n\nThis will not be out until sometime next Winter.\nOk, ok... you guys wanted more.\nAs of today the following things are working/semi-working:\nNetwork play\nBasic Engine\nObject Modeling\nMap Editor\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nNetwork Play:\nServer/Client code is functioning great.

There is no DeathMatch yet, but this\nwill be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc, will\nbe added in later.\n\nBasic Engine:\nThis is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,\nbut this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single\nplayer.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the\nengine.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200\npolygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we\nwould need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail\nwe want. So far this is the only \"thing\" in the game. He does not\nanimate, but it is still cool to watch him be \"born\". At the moment\nhe is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.\n\nMap Editor:\nJohn also has a map editor in the works. At this point it looks\nsomewhat like 3D studio, with a camera view and a top down view\nof the thing you are working on. You can add and subtract blocks\nof \"material\" from the view. These are the building blocks of the\nworld... No, you will not be limited to blocks in the finished game.\n\nAll of this will come together very soon to create one of the most\nawesome network/3D games in the world... if not the most awesome\n(Ok, who are we kidding?

I'll admit at first I was not so impressed, the game\nlacked some of the finer details that make DOOM so fun, but now...\nsome have said it's better than, well... DOOM.

Here is some sort of cheesy, lame-ass attempt\nat an update. Hope you're happy. You just wasted time\nwe could have spent making Quake come out tomorrow. Now\nit will have to wait until Spring :)\n\nYou all want to know why Quake is not going to be out\nuntil Spring... well, here it is: We are making it better.\nThat is all there is to it. We refuse to release something\nthat we are not going to have fun playing, because that\nmeans that you probably won't have fun playing it. We\ntook a good look at where the game was going and decided\nto take it in some other direction. Yes, it will still be\neverything you ever wanted from the original Quake idea,\nminus some things we thought sucked, and plus some things\nthat we think were missing from the old design.\n\nThings that work:\nJust about everything.\n\nThings we are working on:\nSpeed, monsters, actual game play :), more\nweapons, figuring out some way to have all\nthe people who send us mail bugging us about\nQuake run over by a truck. Joystick code,\nitems, environmental hazards, etc...\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nNetwork Play:\nWe have DeathMatch! (This is really why we are delaying the\nrelease... we have been playing DM too much.)\nRight now we can start up a game with n players and\nrun around killing each other all day long. You\ncan leave the game, and then jump back in whenever\nyou like (as long as the server is still running.)\nDeathMatch right now is great, and it is going to\nget even better. We have found the replacement for\nDOOM DeathMatch... finally :)\n\nEngine:\nAll VESA resolutions are now in. Video hardware support\nis in and working for some cards now. This means that\nyou can run 640x480 at high frame rates. I mean *high*\ntoo. The engine is just about done. There is not much\nmissing from it now. Textures and modeling are rock solid.\nAt this point we are working on the game itself and the\nengine details... minor but important stuff.\n\nMap Editor:\nCarmack just rewrote the editor to allow us more\nflexibility while designing levels. This took some\ntime, but it was worth it. We are now able to\ndo things that were once impossible with the old\neditor.\n\nOk, there it is. Just to be nice I am going to\ngive everyone out there the chance to get some\nstuff added that you think might be missing.\nIf there is something important (*important*)\nmissing from the above text, you send me some\nmail and tell me. I probably will not reply unless\nyou ask something so dumb that I have to tell you\nhow dumb it was. I will take questions and try to\nanswer them here until the end of the week.\nThat's FRIDAY, Dec 8th. Then I am going to delete\nthis message and ignore all Quake related mail for\nquite some time.\n\nWe really don't want to piss you all off by ignoring your\nquestions while we are working on this game, but this is\na small company with limited resources to answer all of\nyour mail about Quake. You get one week and I will try to\nanswer all the questions I can. The ones I cannot\nanswer I will try to put in here so that you do not\nall waste your time trying to get the same non-answerable\n(that is a word :) question answered.\n\nSend your mail to american@idsoftware.com\n\nPlease, no novels about what you think Quake\nshould be, and try to ask questions that can\nbe answered in simple yes and no answers.\nCheck here every day to see if someone else\nhas already asked your question before mailing\nthem off to me. Thanks.\n\n1monSkey \\'men-ke!\\\n[prob. of LG origin; akin to Moneke, name of an ape, prob. of\nRomance origin; akin to OSp mona monkey] (ca. 1530)\n1: a primate mammal with the exception of man and usu. the\nlemurs and tarsiers; esp: any of the longer tailed primates\nlike Munchkin as contrasted with the apes, which Munchkin can\nonly go down on if he pays them.\n2a: a person resembling a monkey or Munchkin.\n3: Any semi-primate descended from Munchkin's mom.\n\n-----------Quake Questions Answered------------------\n: will Quake still be medieval as planned?\nYes. The architecture will remain the same,\nbut we are planning on some new stuff. Not saying\nwhat yet though.\n\n: Also, Romero mentioned looking up and down was a lot\n: easier in Quake than it was in Heretic.\nYes, it will be. There will be more automatic looking\nup and down which means that you will not have to worry\nabout doing it yourself. This will not interfere with\ngameplay though.\n\n: I just bought a 3 button logitech mouse with the assumption\n: that it'd be a bit easier to handle Quake with 3 buttons.\n: Is this in any way true?\nAs far as mice go, this will be the way to do it. There\nmay be other controllers out there more suited to Quake\nby the time it comes out though. Right now we are all\nusing Logitech three button mice.\n\n: Romero stated that id would be unable to use the name Quake\n: since some German company copywrote it first. Any word on\n: the new name (assumadly you'll copywrite it before releasing\n: it this time).\nWe have a new name, but like you said, we cannot release\nit until we have it copyrighted.\n\n: Any major differences between Quake and DOOM deathmatch, besides\n: free coming and going from games?\nWell, these things could change... but right now when you\nkill someone who is carrying rockets he might explode and\ntake you with him:) Also, when you kill someone they dump\nall the ammo they were carrying. There are more, but we\nare not going to get into it right now.\n\n: Do you guys expect to get a fluid\n: game with a bunch of 28800 ppp people\nYes.\n\n: Also, will there be more dmatch \"modes\", such as team games\n: like capture the flag or team wars?\nYes, and it will be very easy for the person running the\nserver to program these games in if he/she wants to.\n\n: Also, since Quake will supposedly offer the ability to play with\n: many many people on one map, how will individuals be differentiated?\nYou will be able to use different \"skins\" so that you\ncould have a huge dragon on the front of your guy etc...\n\n: Any word on how servers will function?\nNot going into this right now.\n\n: On a minor, technological note, any realtime shadows yet?\nNo, this will probably be in our next game though.\n\n: Movable walls in any way?\nAlready in there.\n\n: What about monster AI, will it be slimmed down to near-doom\n: levels to up speed in other areas?\nMonster AI will be much cooler than DOOM AI. Already is.\n\n: Will tcp/ip support be built in?\nAlready is.\n\n: I have read that it will be possible to actually edit maps\n: while \"live action\" is taking place.\nThis will not be possible.\n\n: Along those lines, will it (can it?) be possible to\n: allow a person to directly control a monster (non-player\n: character) in the same manner one controls his/her hero?\nThis could be possible, but we are not going to include the\ncode to allow you to do this. It would be something you\nwould have to add in yourself. It would not be hard to\nadd though.\n\n: i want to be prepared, so what are the h/w requirements\n: for the Quake server?\nWe are not releasing these specs yet. They will not be\ntoo hard to take though.\n\n: What about the Mac version of Quake? When will it come out\n: and what differences will there be?\nThis will eventually happen, and the difference will be that\nit is on the Mac.\n\n: Also, any chance in hell I will be able to run smoothly over\n: the net on my puny little 14.4?\nYour modem would not be the problem here, it would be the net...\nbut you might be able to find a server with a small amount of\nlag that would be playable.\n\n: You mentioned joystick code, is the joystick going to be a plausible\n: way to control your character in Quake (unlike doom) with (I'm assuming)\n: variable sensitivity and analog support?\nThe joystick code will be cool. Better than in DOOM, and should be\na cool way to control looking up and down (with a hatstick).\n\n: Is there anything planned regarding 3D rendering card support?\nAs said above, we have this working and it is cool.\n\n: Can walls be damaged or destroyed during combat?\nNo.\n\n: Does Quake incorporate traps and puzzles to allow\n: allow unarmed players to overcome armed apponents\n: by using their wits and stealth?\nNo, there is no violence in that now is there?\n\n: How will close combat weapons be handled?\nAs simply as possible. Push the key. No more than that.\n\n: How does the character's speed/control compare to DOOM?\n: Will we still be able to mouse-flick 180 degrees and\n: strafe-run etc?\nHell yes. Do you really think that we would let the keyboard\nlamers play the same game as those who know the *right* way\nto play?!\n\n: Which video cards will you be enabling hardware support for?\nWe are speaking of the hardware accelerator boards here. You\nwill be able to use any card that someone bothers to write a\ndriver for. We are making sure that it is possible to write\nexternal drivers for things like this.\n\n: Are we still going to be able to play peer-to-peer deathmatch games?\nYes, you would just run the server on one of the machines\nthat you are using... that machine would act as client to\nitself.\n\n: Will it be possible to setup a \"Quake\" server in conjunction with a\n: multi-line bbs (even if the players have to access it thru slip on the\n: network).\nYes.\n\n: Can we expect a demo/screen shots in the next month or two? Atleast a\n: freakin animation!?\nNo answer on this.\n\n: WHats the current weapon count? What will the final count be?\nThree right now. We are not sure of the final count.\n\n: Have any new monsters been completed?\nYes. I would like to describe some of them, but that is\ninfo that we cannot release right now.\n\n: Has Into the Shadows had and effect on the release date?\nNo.\n\n: Can players be on multiple levels in dmatch? Like You and I (yeah right)\n: in level 1, and Jromero in 2?\nIf the OS that you are running the server under is something\nreal like Linux you will be able to do this.\n\n: 1. Is Trent still doing the sounds, or is that being redone too?\nYes, Trent is still doing the sounds. And doing a great job too.\n\n: 2. You mentioned rockets -- in a medieval setting ?\nHmmm... things could change you know.\n\n: Is the target hardware still 486 dx/2 66 w/ 8mb and non 3d card?\n: If so, at what res will it be running?\nIt does run on this, but you have to size the screen down a\nlittle bit. We are still working on getting the speed up,\neven though it is running very fast right now anyway.\n\n: Any price yet?\nNope.\n\n: Is it easy to modify your character so that you will look\n: different than the others in a deathmatch?\nYou would just give yourself a new skin texture. Should not\nbe too hard to do.\n\n: So what comes after Quake? Spooge....\nWait and see.\n\n: How many levels will the shareware be?\nSame as DOOM.\n\n: Will weapons be multipurpose (like Dark forces; hit an\n: alternate key and throw the hammer instead)?\nThis is possible.\n\n: Story so far?\nHahaha!\n\n: Character Demo? Hehehhehehehe\nNot yet, but we will send something out soon.\n\n: ARE YOU KEEPING THAT STUPID HAMMER,and THERE WILL be multiple\n: weapons a yes,no and a yes,no Is all I need\nWe are not saying about this right now.\n\n: Do you plan on releasing the map\n: editor/graphic/sound editors you used for the game?\nYes, we will be doing this.\n\n: Trent's going to be doing the FX, correct? I've read interviews\n: with romero that've said there will be no music, and there will\n: be trent's music. What's going on? :)\nTrent is doing the SFX for sure and we are trying to\nfigure out if we are going to be able to include a seperate\nsound track with the game (done by Trent).\n\n: Is id still planning on doing a Sony PlayStation version...and will\n: you consider supporting dial-up with that version?\nWe would like to but we cannot make any promises this early.\n\n: If one were planning on running a server and/or doing a load of editing,\n: would you recomend submerging one-self's in NeXTSTEP or LINUX to prepare?\nWell, the only OS you would want to run a *real* server on would\nneed to be under some multitasking OS like Linux or Next, but you\ncan run simple (single level, multiplayer) servers on a DOS box.\nAs far as the editors go... we will probably release the Next and\na WIN95 version of QuakeEd.\n\n: Will it be possible to swim in Quake?\nYes.\n\n: Will a multi-player game be possible using a single computer\n: playing split-screen, instead of needing a network?\nNo.\n\n: You mentioned peer to peer will work by having one machine act as\n: server and client. Will this give any advantage to either machine in\n: terms of performance?\nThe machine acting as client and server will suffer some, but\nnot a lot.\n\n: Will there be flying in Quake? If so, will it be controlled like\n: Heretic/Hexen (fly up/down) or like descent (fly where you point)?\nThere will be a lot of tossing and involuntary leaving the ground:)\nBut there probably won't be any sustained flying.\n\n: Will quake support/use math co-pros.\nNo.\n\n: Is the software required to run a server included in the game?   Will it be\n: present in the shareware version in one form or another?\nYes. Yes.\n\n: How is Quake looking in comparison to DN3D?  Is Apogee making you sweat as\n: much now as they did releasing Blake Stone on the eve of Doom's release?\nHahahah.\n\n: Are any of Trent's sound FX going to revolve around the \"piggy\" theme that\n: is so prevalent in his music?\nSo far they have not, but we will have to wait and see. We have\nnot put any restraints on him... the sfxs are his deal.\n\n: Will there be fog in Quake?\nNot in Quake. Next game.\n\n: Also, will it be possible to QUICKLY kill people (one shot in the back,\n: point blank)?  Will there be body part-specific damage?\nYes and yes.\n\n: would quake client/server run under win95? i mean, using winsock32 and\n: win95 based calls.\nYes.\n\n: if i can have 2 machines networked locally, which one should be running\n: quake server?\nThe faster machine.\n\n: would i be able to run quake server in win95?\nYes.\n\n: Will \"Quake\" have any moving light sources?\nNo. The engine is not set up for things like this.\n\n: Will Quake have full support for the Logitech Cyberman?\nYes, we will include the \"hammer driver\" with Quake so that\nyou can smash the shit out of your CyberMan and by a real controller.\n\n: Will you be able to tell what weapons / armour / artifacts a guy\n: is carrying (before he gets a chance to use them)?\nYes.\n\n: 1st - Will there still be \"voice support\" through the network.  i.e.\n: speaking through a mic and the people \"closest\" to you can hear\n: you while the people furtherst away might faintly hear you or not\n: hear you at all.\nThis will be in there soon.\n\n: 2nd - How will the support be with the VFX1 virtual reality helmet?\nIt will be great. Don't worry.\n\n: 3rd - Can damage be inflicted to certain areas of the body  i.e. if I\n: hit someone in the left shoulder, will they be knocked back in that\n: area?  Will they bleed from that area?\nYes, they will show the damage in the area where you hit them.\n\n: 1.)  Will Quake support 16bit or 24bit color modes?\n16bit under DOS and you can get 24bit under other OSs.\n\n: 2.)  Will Quake be a native Win95 app?\nThere will be a version of this, yes.\n\n: What Operating System will Quake come out for first?\n: DOS? Win95?(Not that Win95 is an OS) Linux?\nDOS, Linux, WIN95, NeXT, IRIX, and maybe more.\n\n: What Operating System will the server Software run under?\n: Unix? Linux? Sun?\nAll of the above.\n\n: What special fees will be involved in running a Quake Server?\nWe have not decided on how this will work yet.\n\n: I read somewhere that all level editing/creating would be done\n: through text (indicating object, coordinates, texture, etc.) to\n: make it easier for people to create level editors. Is this true?\nLevel editing is done in a CAD-like program that we created,\ncalled QuakeEd. When creating objects in the world that you\ninteract with though, you program these in QuakeC.\n\n: Could you tell us a little bit more about how the\n: character animations are done?\nKevin Cloud created monsters/characters with Alias and\nthen animates them and generates frames. The frames are\nthen played back in the QuakeC code whenever the character\nattacks/moves etc...\n\n:  In \"quake\", will the water be maybe deeper, and to make it more\n: realistic, will walking/wading through water slow you down?\nYou will be able to go underwater in Quake.\n\n: Will ammunition be a light source (e.g. fire a rocket and it lights up\n: the corridor as it flies)?\nNo.\n\n: Will there be support for I-glasses and other *TRUE*\n: stereoscopic headsets?\nYes.\n\n: Just out of curiosity...Has id thought about setting up it's own quake\n: network (national, or, in any case, big and public)?\nWe are thinking about this.\n\n: How will the differentiating of other quake players in deathmatch\n: be incorporated? Will we have a charatcer editor for the DM?\nThey will be different colors, or they will have a new skin.\nYou can edit the skins with any paint program that will load\n.lbms.\n\n: 2) Will the DOS version run faster than the Linux version,\n: or vice versa?\nThey will be about the same.\n\n: I herd a rummor that Quake would be ported to Linux like\n: Doom was.  Is there any plans for this or possible plans?\nYes. We love Linux and there will be a Quake version for it.\nWe are hoping that people will realize that Linux is the\nway to go if they want to set up a proper Quake server\nmachine.\n\n: Question 1) Will it be possible to cause environmental damage, such as\n: taking out entire walls in a firefight?\nNo.\n\n: Question 2) Is it possible to dismember enemies?  ie, if I don't like\n: someone's head (or other portion of their physionomy) can I cut it off?\nYes.\n\n: Will \"quake\" be a doom-like slugfest or will you ( and them) be harder to\n: kill then just one blast?\nCome on. Do you want to *wait* to kill someone by pounding on\nthem with a stick for a while... or do you want to shove a\nshotgun under their chin and watch their brains hit the ceiling?!\nSlugfest.\n\n:    Will there be outdoor landscapes that are really spread out\n: like a huge grass area or forest or some kind of terrain, or is it mostly\n: within the castle sorta thing?\nMostly indoors.\n\n: ah yes, i almost forgot.. will quake use wads of some sort? or will\n: everything be in an external file?\nSounds and qc files will be external. Maps and textures will be in\nwads, although we are not calling them that now:)\n\n: Can you move, pile up, or stand on top of dead bodies? Heheheh\n: (alt.games.quake)\nYes, these things are already in there and quite funny.\n\n: How long do we have to wait for the editor to be released?\nUntil the game is released.\n\n: Can we leave markings on walls (bullet holes)?\nNo.\n\n: You keep mentioning \"next game\" for new features...does this\n: mean Quake II or a different series?\nThis means the next game engine after Quake.\n\n: On the experience part I just wanted to add that it would be nice to be\n: able to save a character and play with him throughout the gamer's\n: QUAKE experience.\nThis is something that we intend to have in there. It will\nbe very cool when playing with persistent servers.\n\n: 1)\tWill there be a shareware release? and when?\nYes. When it is finished.\n\n: 2)\tWhat actions can be performed? eg: Running, climbing, rolling,\n: crouching, jumping, leaning etc.\nRight now there is jumping and leaning... there will be\nclimbing (maybe).\n\n: 3)\tI know that heads can be cut off, what about arms, legs, torso's etc.\nDepends on the creature you are attacking. Basically you cannot\ndo this all the time to all creatures (too many frames) but\nwe are going to make sure you can do this sometimes.\n\n: 4)\tAre you guys still supporting the Verite Rendition card? What about\n: Lockheed & Martin's Cards.\nWe are supporting the Rendition card. All others cards will be\nable to be added later by others.\n\n: 5)\tWill there be Day and Night? Weather effects?\nProbably not... but we will see.\n\n: 6)\tStill able to sacrifice to the Daemons???\nOf course.\n\n: 7)\tHow much interaction with the environment will there be?? like moving\n: boxes, smashing things, leaving marks on the environment (burn marks from a\n: spell say for instance)\nWe are not sure yet... depends on how much we think it adds\nto the actual gameplay once it is in... these things sometimes\nlook cool the first time but then get to be old after a while.\n\n: 8)\tAre your 3D polygon character models as detailed as the models in\n: Triton's Into the Shadows? (The guys hair and tunic moves!! V-cool!)\nThey are pretty detailed. ITS and Quake are two totally different\ntypes of games though... it is not fair to either product to make\nthese comparisons.\n\n: 9)\tI know you've said there will be no shadows from the characters, but\n: come on, if Into the Shadows can manage Multiple shadows, Why not Quake???\n: What specifically is stopping you from implementing them. Without them the\n: characters dont look like they belong in the scene if ya know what I mean?!\nSee above.\n\n: this is prolly a stupid question, but will I be able to play quake\n: over a regular modem with a friend, without a server/client deal?\nI will do some explaining for those of you who do understand how\nthis is going to work. The client is the machine that you will\nbe playing the game on. It is the machine that all the graphics\nget drawn by, and all your input goes into. The server is the\nmachine that takes care of all the difficult computations\nneeded in order to create realistic environments like the ones\nin Quake. When running Quake on one PC you are actually running\nboth the client and the server on the same machine. There are\na few different combinations that Quake will allow when it comes\nto this though... you could 1) play single player with the client\non one machine and the server on another. 2) play multiplayer with\nthe clients on different machines all over the place and the server\non a separate machine or 3) play multiplayer with the server running\non one of the machines that is also being used as a client. In\neffect, one of the guys is going to use his machine as the server\nfor everyone else (including himself) and the client for himself.\nSo... in your situation you could do this two ways: 1) you could\nset up the server for the game and your client on your machine\nand have your friend call you or 2) you guys could set up a separate\nmachine with two modems in it and you both call it to play. (there\nare other combinations but I think you get the idea.) Whew... lot's\nof text and I bet that made no sense at all :)\n\n: 1.In previous DOOM DOOM2 etc. each computer had to have a copy of the\n: wad(pwad) file to play a homebrew level(s). Will it be possible in\n: Quake to Xfer levels between computers or at least from the server\n: to play a game? This would be a welcome feature for playing over the\n: net and also LANs.\nWe are working on a way to include all the sounds/gfx in the\nwad file so that each wad file contains it's own gfx palette\nand sounds... this way you have one file that contains everything\nand you could potentially transfer this file to a server. This code\nis not in there yet, and we may not put it in there ourselves,\nbut it would not be hard to add.\n\n: 2.Will their be some sort of a licence site (for a LAN) / package?\nThere will be, but we are not sure about how it is going to work\nyet.\n\n: Are you going to create a dynamic outdoor setting, too?\nThe game is better suited to cool indoor areas, but you could\ndo outside areas also. We are thinking in terms of levels\nthat everyone out there can play, and so we are trying to\nmake sure that the levels we create have a good balance\nof coolness/speed. There should be some nice outdoor areas\nin Quake.\n\n: Okay, you may not want to release direct info on the server hardware\n: requierements right now, but i am wondering how many users will a Server\n: running on a Pentium 120 (with enough mem) will be able to support? (A\n: rough number at least)\nWe honestly do not know yet. We have been running some servers\non a P90 and we have hooked in around 9 clients without any slow\ndown at all. The max number is not really known yet... but I think\nit will be pretty high.\n\n: Also, assuming people are playing on a server via 28.8K modems, how many\n: users can there be in the game before the game strts getting slugish?\nAgain, we do not know about this. Modem code is not finished\nyet and we have not set up a machine with a ton of modems in\nit yet to test this. It will be pretty high though.\n\n: First, I assume the Quake version for win95 will incorperate directdraw,\n: and all those neat goodies. Will it run faster on a win95 platform as\n: opposed to DOS or LINUX?\nIt will be about the same speed.\n\n: Will it be possible to kill enemies, gain experience for that, and thus\n: grow in power and hp's?\nThis is something that will be possible in DeathMatch, but we\nare not thinking about doing in the actual game. We will\nsee.\n\n: What controller would you recommend when this comes out?\nRight now we are all using Logitech three button mice, but\nsomething cooler might come along before we release.\n\n: How much longer after the DOS release will the Win95 release be?\nThey should come out about the same time. The DOS version we have\nnow will run fine under WIN95 though.\n\n: Will it be possible to hide in the shadows of a corner and thus jump\n: an enemy from behind and crush his skull in?\nYes.\n\n: Is this going to be a CD-ROM game, and if so what kind of speed would\n: you be looking at?\nNope. CD-ROM does not == action.\n\n: Will it be possible to record a game ie: doom lmp's?\nYes.\n\n: Will Quake support the Microsoft Sidewinder Pro, especially the swivel\n: feature?\nFor those of you asking if we are going to support x or y please\nunderstand something: We are writing Quake in such a way that\nwhen we release it the manufactures of these products will be\nable to quickly and easily add support for their products. Chances\nare that many of the cool people out on the net will be writing\nmost of the device drivers for all the cool add ons you want.\n\n: The thing that facinates me about quake is its 3D aspect.  Will you provide\n: true floor over floor design and will the outside environment be realistic?\nFloor over floor is already in there. Has been since the beginning.\nOutsides will be cool.\n\n: What color depth will Quake run in?\nRight now the only depth we are sure of is 8bit. It may ship\nwith the ability to run 8, 16, 24... but we are not sure.\nIt does not matter because the only thing that looks better\nthan 8bit is 24bit, and it is not that big of a difference.\n(This is all under DOS) If you are running under Next you\ncan get 24bit and Linux can get 8 or 16bit.\n\n: I would like to know just how much freedom will quakeC give me.\n: Will it be like a suped dehacked, where all I can do is make new\n: levels monsters and weapons.\nIn QuakeC you will have control over all objects in the world\nsuch as doors, players, weapons, monsters, items etc... This means\nyou could totally reprogram any one of these things from scratch\nor just make minor modifications if you wanted to. You could\nalso turn Quake into a new game with some modifications to\nthe QuakeC and with some changes in the actual C code. (We are\ngoing to release as much of this as we can).\n\n: you mention that QuakeEd will be released w/\n: Quake but for creating objects that you interact with\n: you will need to program in QuakeC.  Will you then\n: also release a QuakeC compiler?\nAll you need to edit QuakeC is a text editor. The QuakeC will\ngo out with the game in the same form that we are working on\nit here. The compiler is built into the game and compiles the\ncode every time you run the game.\n\n: If you w/ a fast puter and somebody w/ a slow puter\n: are loged into the same Quake server, will you be able\n: to run/shoot faster than him?\nThe guy with the fast computer will have a higher frame rate\nand he will get more updates to the server than the other guy...\nin effect he will have an advantage, but on the other hand if\na dork with a slow computer joins a game where everyone is playing\nwith extremely fast systems and connects he will not cause everyone\nelse to slow down.\n\n: 1.) will quake be so advanced that other software companies will\n: not be able to claim that their game is \"like-quake, only better\"\n: or will the engine be easily cloned within a year after the\n: initial release?\nI refuse to answer these types of questions on the grounds that\nI want to say something like \"Quake will smash the shit out of\nall other games... and other game companies pee on themselves.\"\nIf I say things like that I get flamed by other game companies...\nand besides, it's not \"professional\" :)\n\n: 2.) will the quake engine be licensed for other games?\n: possibly a DOOM 3?\nOf course.\n\n: 3.) do you guys realize how freaking anxious all of us are for\n: the release?\nUh, no. Really? I've only gotten 200+ pieces of mail in the\nlast 12 hours!\n\n: How will the auto-mapping be handled?\nThere probably will be no automap.\n\n: How will lmp recording be handled? The same as Doom or from room\n: cameras or something different?\nSame as in DOOM, although it would not be hard to get cameras\nin there.\n\n: Will there a weapon that is as satisfying as\n: the Doom shotgun/super shotgun..\n:) Wait and see.\n\n: What will be the minium modem speed?\nProbably 9600bps.\n\n: If you have run Quake with a 3d accelerator yet, what is the\n: performance improvement estimate?\nIt is great. I will get the exact specs from Michael in\nthe morning... something like 640x480 at 30+ fps.\n\n: About how many enemies/level?\nThis is not something we are going to release yet.\n\n: What do you plan to do to defend Quake against products like D!zone?\nKill. :) Not sure yet.\n\n: When 3D characters were used in games like fade to black and alone in\n: the dark, player control was compromised because the character could\n: not stop on a dime, if he was in the middle of a step, he would\n: complete his step first.  What is Quake's position on this?\nWe have always hated shit like that and we will not\nallow something that \"looks cool\" to destroy the overall\nfun of the game.\n\n: 1.  If I have a network setup between a couple of comps in my\n: apartment, can someone call in on my modem (with my comp as server)\n: and join in the mayhem?\nYes.\n\n: 2.  Are the levels gonna be interconnected... and if so, how would\n: this work in DM?  Say I wanted to pound somebody but I couldn't\n: find them.\nYes they are, but you will be able to specify whether\npeople can go to the next level or not. It will depend\na lot on the type of OS you are running. If the OS\nis multitasking and can run more than one server at a time\nthen when someone leaves a level it can either, take everyone\nwith that guy... or spawn a new server with that level on it\nthat would then run side by side with the current level.\nThis could obviously cause problems if everyone went to\ndifferent levels, but there will be ways to control how\nthis works.\n\n: 3.  Is the Hell Spawn Matrix Death Cube '95 (tm) still in there, or\n: is there going to be a similar object in the game?\nNot sure now.\n\n: 4.  Is voice going to be incorporated in games run over modem?\nIf the modem will support it. We are not going to try to\nget this into the code though.\n\n: 5.  Ponder this:  I've got a network of 8 comps... say the server is\n: a P-100 with 16 megs o ram running win95.... slow or fast net game?\nShould be ok.\n\n: 6.  On the day that Quake is released, is the Internet going to see\n: its biggest shutdown since RTM's worm?  If so, can I stop by Id's office to\n: copy the shareware version? :)\nHeh... what do you think? Crash bitch! Crash!\nYeah, we would *love* to see all our fans here at the office\ntrying to get copies of the game the day we release... I think\nthe building would crash :) Would not be so bad if all our fans\nwere gorgeous super models of course...\n\n: \tWill I be COOL if I play Quake?\nNo, you will be cool if you suck my... anyway.\n\n: 1) Dead bodies as armor (i.e. use your dead buddy as a shield from\n: bullets)?\nThis would be pretty funny... we will see.\n\n: 2) Multiple games with different configs (i.e running three quake server\n: on one one computer for the novice, the moderate, and the psychopath)?\nThis is working now.\n\n: 3) Can characters build shield/shelters from raw material objects in the\n: game (i.e. hold up box in front of chest to keep from getting blasted in\n: the chest)?\nNo.\n\n: b)Would modifying the source slow it down at all, or is it compiled BEFORE\n: runtime on the server?\nYou can modify the source while the game is running but the\nchanges will not take effect until the progs are reloaded... but\nthis is something that you can do on the fly. Basically you would\ntell the server to reload everything, the game would freeze, but\neveryone would stay connected... once the progs were reloaded\n(if there were no bugs in your code) things would continue with\nyour changes.\n\n: c)Can the anti-christianity stuff be kept to a minimum?\nWho says that is Jesus anyway?! That could just be Bob or something.\n\n: d)Will cross-platform netquake be possible with big endian and little endian\n: machines playing together?\nThis will not be a problem. We are already doing it.\n\n: Will it be easy(no c coding involved) to configure a large group DM\n: session so that players do not respawn?\nThis would be *very* easy, but you would have to know how to\nuse QuakeC, which is much like C.\nYou would take this code:\n\tif (!self.button1)\n\t\treturn;\n\tself.deadflag = DEAD_RESPAWNED;\n\t...\nand make it this:\n\tif (!self.button1)\n\t\treturn;\n\treturn;\n\tself.deadflag = DEAD_RESPAWNED;\n\t...\nHe would then never come back.\n\n: 1) I remeber hearing that you guys were designing a new protical for\n: games on the internet.  What's the status of this?\nCarmack is still working on this.\n\n: 2) Does the concept of a \"god person\" still apply?  Can a person change\n: the game play environment during an actuall net game?\nYes.\n\n: Will you be able to drop/hand-off weapons/items (that other players can\n: pick-up)?\nNot on purpose, but if your buddy buys it right next to you\nhe will drop all the shit he was carrying and then you\ncan pick it up. (or you could leave it for him so he\ncan come back and get it... nah, fuck him.)\n\n: By customizing my character's 'skin' with a wall texture, will I be able\n: to hide (in a chameleon like way) by just standing still against a like\n: wall (and then pop out and kill the f%&ker)?\nUh... yeah... I had not thought of that one. You guys suck.\nI can just see it now... a bunch of dorks running around the\nlevels in \"wall texture camo\" going \"Where is everybody?!\"\n\n: Please, oh please, can you give us to ability to eat a slain opponent,\n: thereby gaining health & maybe his magic power? (or just for fun)\nTrent already did some good bone crunch/gut rip sounds that we\nare planing to use just for this. Who cares if it helps your\nhealth or not... it will be fun to kill someone and then take\na bite out of their face for good measure. :)\n\n:Once \"Quake\" is ready for release, will you then announce a release date,\n:or will it just suddenly appear on an FTP site somewhere?\nHehe. This is a good question, but we are not sure yet.\nSomething like 1... 2... 3... release! Crash!\n\n: You mentioned \"involuntary leaving the ground\". Is it possible to knock\n: someone off a cliff with a hammer blow to the back, or (even more fun)\n: can you throw people? :-o\nYou will not be able to throw people, but all weapons\nwill impart some velocity to the \"victim\". If the weapon\nis strong enough it will make him leave the ground. (We\nhave managed to get dead bodies to fly up into supports\nacross the ceiling:)\n\n: Can you aim your weapon to a specific body part. Like aim for an\n: knights weapon arm. Or are you stuck with a top right to bottom left\n: swing (assuming close combat weapons)?\nThis is DeathMatch, if you spend that much time trying to hit\nsomewhere specific you will be dead.\n\n: If you can aim your attack is it possible to block an oppents attack by\n: swinging at it? (Clash sword against sword)\nThis will not be in there.\n\n: Assuming close combat weapons, will the length of the swing affect the\n: damage? Short swings low damage but quick recovery. Long swings slower\n: but deadly.\nNot going to happen.\n\n: Will the user interface be as customizable as the rest of the program?\nYes.\n\n: You said that characters show damage on specific body parts but will it\n: impair them? Would a wounded leg decrease running speed?\nWe are thinking about this, but we are not sure if we like the\nidea or not yet. We will try it out and if it is cool it will\nstay, if not it will end up in some other companies game.\n\n: 1) Does the framerate max out, and if so, what is the maximum?\nNot right now. Probably will not.\n\n: 2) Is there support for external 24-bit models / sprites?\nModels already are.\n\n: 3) What sound formats are supported (i.e. Qsound, ProLogic, etc.)\nAnything that someone wants to write support for.\n\n: 4) What is the minimum requirement / recommended system?\nUhg.\n\n: 5) Will there be a version of Quake optimized for the P6?\nFor the Pentium yes, P6 probably not.\n\n: 6) What will the primary distribution format be?\nNot sure yet.\n\n: 7) About how much disk space will Quake require (game, drivers, swapfiles)?\nShould not be much more than DOOM.\n\n: 8) Will specifications be released before the game so that editors and\n: other levels can be released concurrently?\nYES.\n\n: What 3D acceleration chipsets does ID like?  Which will y'all support?\nRight now the only thing we are playing with is the Rendition.\nThere will be others, but we cannot comment on this right now.\n\n:   You stated that you would make QuakEd available for Win95 and NexT.\n: What about us Linux users?  You were talking about how much you loved it\n: and everything, so I was hoping you could be persuaded to port it to\n: Linux too.\nIt would be cool to have a Linux version... but we do not have\ntime to do it. I am sure that once we release the source those\ncool Linux Gods out there will have an editor ready for you in\na matter of minutes.\n\n: 3. Can we add different death frames to the guys? (like a new type of\n: death.. e.g. die of poisoning)\nYou will be able to add new ones easily and there will be several\nin there when we ship the game.\n\n: 5. I can't wait to see the swimming.. can you drown?  (attach weights to\n: your opponents..)\nWe are still working on this. I do not think we will have drowning,\nbut there will be some cool things happening when you kill a person\nin the water. (bodies float to the surface etc...)\n\n: Also.. you've been letting all these comments about\n: Quake possibly having modern elements (like rockets) sorta slide..\n: not gonna  elaborate??\nHehe. Not going to elaborate. Nope.\n\n: Anyway, you mentioned that in Quake you WOULD be able to get\n: experience for killing other people. Does this mean that you could\n: just beat up on newbies all day and end up powerful enough to beat a\n: better player?\nNo, you get points based on the skill of the guy you\njust killed. Newbies would give you little or no points\ndepending on how the server was set up... and some servers\ncan be set up not to allow newbies or American-Like-God\nplayers on in order to keep things fair.\n\n: Several versions of DOOM were public betas.  Heretic had a public\n: beta.  Hexen had a public beta.  So why can't you release a Quake beta?\nWe are working on something.\n\n(I hope someone out there is keeping all of this in\nsome sort of FAQ so that I don't have to do this again\nanytime soon :)\nIf you sent a question and it does not get answered make\nsure that someone else did not ask a question that was\nsimilar... if you still do not find it that means that\nwe either are not talking about that or the question\nyou asked would have required some serious explanation\nthat I am not willing to get into here.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n\n********\nTHERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*!\nTHERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST EITHER.\nWE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.\n********\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nStatus of DOOM---Updated: Fri, Jul 28th 3:22pm\n\nWe have mastered The Ultimate DOOM! *This is out in stores now*.\nThere is a patch for registered DOOM owners that will turn your\nDOOM into Ultimate DOOM for free.

Set up a Quake server on\na NeXT, Linux, or SGI box. Once the server is running you\nget on another machine (NeXT, Linux, SGI) and log into the server.\nA play window opens and you can see the other players, move around,\nquit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but this\nwill be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc, will\nbe added in later.\n\nBasic Engine:\nThis is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,\nbut this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single\nplayer.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the\nengine.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200\npolygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we\nwould need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail\nwe want. So far this is the only \"thing\" in the game. He does not\nanimate, but it is still cool to watch him be \"born\". At the moment\nhe is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.\n\nMap Editor:\nJohn also has a map editor in the works. At this point it looks\nsomewhat like 3D studio, with a camera view and a top down view\nof the thing you are working on. You can add and subtract blocks\nof \"material\" from the view. These are the building blocks of the\nworld... No, you will not be limited to blocks in the finished game.\n\n**We will not be adding anything new to this for a while.\nThere are MANY cool new things going into the game right now, but\nwe do not want to give it all away just yet. We have been creating\nsmall test levels for the past few weeks, and these are looking\nawesome. The general game idea has started to solidify, but please\ndo not write asking what it is.\nI will add some new stuff here when there is *alot* more to add.\n\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ to help@idsoftware.com\n_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_\n\nWHAT IS id?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

If we still\nhave bugs after uploading v1.6, the next version will be 1.61.\n\nThere is NO version 1.3.\nThere is a 1.4 beta and a 1.5 beta.\nVersion 1.4 is available from ftp.uwp.edu and infant2.sphs.indiana.edu.\nIt is a beta shareware version. There is NO PATCH to 1.4.\n\nWe are still waiting on the sound code. There are a few little bugs in\nit still that HAVE to be fixed before we release the patch. We know\n(I know really well) how impatient some of you are getting. There is\nstill no firm date on a release. As soon as our sound code guy is\nfinished the patch will be sent out. There will probably be a 1.6 BETA\nversion, and then a few days after that we will release the 1.7 patch.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStatus of DOOM ][---Updated: Wed, Aug 3rd 1:27pm\n\nThere are now about 32 levels finished.\n\nThe new monsters are great.

NO CHANGE.\n\nWINDOWS: We just got a beta of this. Looks AWESOME. Still no release\ndate. The IBM guys are working on this.\n\nNEXTSTEP: There is a version 1.2 available from cs.orst.edu. There will\nbe a ver 1.6 available there as soon as we release the patch for\nthe DOS version. This will be out next in-house port. Dave will be\ndoing this and it will have full sound and music when it's done, just\nlike the SGI version.\n\nIf there is not a release date on one of the above that means it\ndoesn't have one.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStatus of QUAKE---Updated: Mon, July 25th 6:14pm\n\nThis will not be out until sometime next summer.\nJohn Carmack is currently designing the engine.\nMulti-player should go something like this:\nSomeone owns a fast server somewhere.

It uses converted\nDOOM maps and runs them with flats for textures. It looks REALLY\ncool.\nOk, imagine this. You have a health thing and you don't need it.\nYou meet someone in the game who has a nice weapon but is really\nlow on health. You guys decide to exchange items. You don't really\ntrust this guy so you bring along a friend and tell him to hide out\nsomewhere with a bead on the other guy's head. You meet somewhere\nin the middle of a field and face off. You drop your health, he drops\nhis weapon and you both strafe over the object of your desire. You\nstart to back away (not turning your back on him) and suddenly decide\nyou're going to whack this guy before he gets a chance to use that\nhealth. You move towards him and draw back with your hammer. He notices\nthis and starts to duck, but it's too late. You smash him in the head\nand watch him fly down to the ground, landing on his side. You smash\nhis still body a few more times and cause him to explode! Now you and\nyour friend pick up all of the items your dead friend left on the\nground. As you are walking off you pick up his severed head and put\nit in a bag. That will come in useful later... when you need something\nto sacrifice to a demon.\n\nJohn has a faster engine working now. Groundwork for network play\nhas been finished. Looking VERY cool. For those of you who still\nhave a wife, kids, a job, and a life after DOOM, this game is for YOU.\nYou DOOM junkies will have a new fix...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ to help@idsoftware.com\n_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_\n\nWHAT IS iD?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

I really want to answer all the\nquestions you people are sending... but there are\ntoo many. Since I started this thing I have recieved\nover 350+ pieces of mail... 10 more while I am writing\nthis! I cannot work on Quake and answer all these questions\nall day long. I know you guys want them answered so\nhere is what I am going to do... I will stop taking\nnew questions right now and finish answering the 160\npeices of mail I still have not gotten to. Once that\nis done I am going to have to call this off. Don't be\nmad... be happy. This means I can get back to work\non Quake and have it out on time. :)\n\nThe reason that Quake will not be released until Spring:\nWe are making sure that this will be the coolest game\nyou ever saw. Nothing more than that.\n\nThings that work:\nJust about everything.\n\nThings we are working on:\nSpeed, monsters, actual game play :), more\nweapons, figuring out some way to have all\nthe people who send us mail bugging us about\nQuake run over by a truck. Joystick code,\nitems, environmental hazards, etc...\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nNetwork Play:\nWe have DeathMatch! (This is really why we are delaying the\nrelease... we have been playing DM too much.)\nRight now we can start up a game with n players and\nrun around killing each other all day long. You\ncan leave the game, and then jump back in whenever\nyou like (as long as the server is still running.)\nDeathMatch right now is great, and it is going to\nget even better. We have found the replacement for\nDOOM DeathMatch... finally :)\n\nEngine:\nAll VESA resolutions are now in. Video hardware support\nis in and working for some cards now. This means that\nyou can run 640x480 at high frame rates. I mean *high*\ntoo. The engine is just about done. There is not much\nmissing from it now. Textures and modeling are rock solid.\nAt this point we are working on the game itself and the\nengine details... minor but important stuff.\n\nMap Editor:\nCarmack just rewrote the editor to allow us more\nflexibility while designing levels. This took some\ntime, but it was worth it. We are now able to\ndo things that were once impossible with the old\neditor.\n\nDone picking on Munchkin.\n\nPlease stop sending Quake questions.\nI cannot keep answering them... it is taking\nway too much time.\n-----------Quake Questions Answered------------------\n: will Quake still be medieval as planned?\nYes. The architecture will remain the same,\nbut we are planning on some new stuff. Not saying\nwhat yet though.\n\n: Also, Romero mentioned looking up and down was a lot\n: easier in Quake than it was in Heretic.\nYes, it will be. There will be more automatic looking\nup and down which means that you will not have to worry\nabout doing it yourself. This will not interfere with\ngameplay though.\n\n: I just bought a 3 button logitech mouse with the assumption\n: that it'd be a bit easier to handle Quake with 3 buttons.\n: Is this in any way true?\nAs far as mice go, this will be the way to do it. There\nmay be other controllers out there more suited to Quake\nby the time it comes out though. Right now we are all\nusing Logitech three button mice.\n\n: Romero stated that id would be unable to use the name Quake\n: since some German company copywrote it first. Any word on\n: the new name (assumadly you'll copywrite it before releasing\n: it this time).\nWe have a new name, but like you said, we cannot release\nit until we have it copyrighted.\n\n: Any major differences between Quake and DOOM deathmatch, besides\n: free coming and going from games?\nWell, these things could change... but right now when you\nkill someone who is carrying rockets he might explode and\ntake you with him:) Also, when you kill someone they dump\nall the ammo they were carrying. There are more, but we\nare not going to get into it right now.\n\n: Do you guys expect to get a fluid\n: game with a bunch of 28800 ppp people\nYes.\n\n: Also, will there be more dmatch \"modes\", such as team games\n: like capture the flag or team wars?\nYes, and it will be very easy for the person running the\nserver to program these games in if he/she wants to.\n\n: Also, since Quake will supposedly offer the ability to play with\n: many many people on one map, how will individuals be differentiated?\nYou will be able to use different \"skins\" so that you\ncould have a huge dragon on the front of your guy etc...\n\n: Any word on how servers will function?\nNot going into this right now.\n\n: On a minor, technological note, any realtime shadows yet?\nNo, this will probably be in our next game though.\n\n: Movable walls in any way?\nAlready in there.\n\n: What about monster AI, will it be slimmed down to near-doom\n: levels to up speed in other areas?\nMonster AI will be much cooler than DOOM AI. Already is.\n\n: Will tcp/ip support be built in?\nAlready is.\n\n: I have read that it will be possible to actually edit maps\n: while \"live action\" is taking place.\nThis will not be possible.\n\n: Along those lines, will it (can it?) be possible to\n: allow a person to directly control a monster (non-player\n: character) in the same manner one controls his/her hero?\nThis could be possible, but we are not going to include the\ncode to allow you to do this. It would be something you\nwould have to add in yourself. It would not be hard to\nadd though.\n\n: i want to be prepared, so what are the h/w requirements\n: for the Quake server?\nWe are not releasing these specs yet. They will not be\ntoo hard to take though.\n\n: What about the Mac version of Quake? When will it come out\n: and what differences will there be?\nThis will eventually happen, and the difference will be that\nit is on the Mac.\n\n: Also, any chance in hell I will be able to run smoothly over\n: the net on my puny little 14.4?\nYour modem would not be the problem here, it would be the net...\nbut you might be able to find a server with a small amount of\nlag that would be playable.\n\n: You mentioned joystick code, is the joystick going to be a plausible\n: way to control your character in Quake (unlike doom) with (I'm assuming)\n: variable sensitivity and analog support?\nThe joystick code will be cool. Better than in DOOM, and should be\na cool way to control looking up and down (with a hatstick).\n\n: Is there anything planned regarding 3D rendering card support?\nAs said above, we have this working and it is cool.\n\n: Can walls be damaged or destroyed during combat?\nNo.\n\n: Does Quake incorporate traps and puzzles to allow\n: allow unarmed players to overcome armed apponents\n: by using their wits and stealth?\nNo, there is no violence in that now is there?\n\n: How will close combat weapons be handled?\nAs simply as possible. Push the key. No more than that.\n\n: How does the character's speed/control compare to DOOM?\n: Will we still be able to mouse-flick 180 degrees and\n: strafe-run etc?\nHell yes. Do you really think that we would let the keyboard\nlamers play the same game as those who know the *right* way\nto play?!\n\n: Which video cards will you be enabling hardware support for?\nWe are speaking of the hardware accelerator boards here. You\nwill be able to use any card that someone bothers to write a\ndriver for. We are making sure that it is possible to write\nexternal drivers for things like this.\n\n: Are we still going to be able to play peer-to-peer deathmatch games?\nYes, you would just run the server on one of the machines\nthat you are using... that machine would act as client to\nitself.\n\n: Will it be possible to setup a \"Quake\" server in conjunction with a\n: multi-line bbs (even if the players have to access it thru slip on the\n: network).\nYes.\n\n: Can we expect a demo/screen shots in the next month or two? Atleast a\n: freakin animation!?\nNo answer on this.\n\n: WHats the current weapon count? What will the final count be?\nThree right now. We are not sure of the final count.\n\n: Have any new monsters been completed?\nYes. I would like to describe some of them, but that is\ninfo that we cannot release right now.\n\n: Has Into the Shadows had and effect on the release date?\nNo.\n\n: Can players be on multiple levels in dmatch? Like You and I (yeah right)\n: in level 1, and Jromero in 2?\nIf the OS that you are running the server under is something\nreal like Linux you will be able to do this.\n\n: 1. Is Trent still doing the sounds, or is that being redone too?\nYes, Trent is still doing the sounds. And doing a great job too.\n\n: 2. You mentioned rockets -- in a medieval setting ?\nHmmm... things could change you know.\n\n: Is the target hardware still 486 dx/2 66 w/ 8mb and non 3d card?\n: If so, at what res will it be running?\nIt does run on this, but you have to size the screen down a\nlittle bit. We are still working on getting the speed up,\neven though it is running very fast right now anyway.\n\n: Any price yet?\nNope.\n\n: Is it easy to modify your character so that you will look\n: different than the others in a deathmatch?\nYou would just give yourself a new skin texture. Should not\nbe too hard to do.\n\n: So what comes after Quake? Spooge....\nWait and see.\n\n: How many levels will the shareware be?\nSame as DOOM.\n\n: Will weapons be multipurpose (like Dark forces; hit an\n: alternate key and throw the hammer instead)?\nThis is possible.\n\n: Story so far?\nHahaha!\n\n: Character Demo? Hehehhehehehe\nNot yet, but we will send something out soon.\n\n: ARE YOU KEEPING THAT STUPID HAMMER,and THERE WILL be multiple\n: weapons a yes,no and a yes,no Is all I need\nWe are not saying about this right now.\n\n: Do you plan on releasing the map\n: editor/graphic/sound editors you used for the game?\nYes, we will be doing this.\n\n: Trent's going to be doing the FX, correct? I've read interviews\n: with romero that've said there will be no music, and there will\n: be trent's music. What's going on? :)\nTrent is doing the SFX for sure and we are trying to\nfigure out if we are going to be able to include a seperate\nsound track with the game (done by Trent).\n\n: Is id still planning on doing a Sony PlayStation version...and will\n: you consider supporting dial-up with that version?\nWe would like to but we cannot make any promises this early.\n\n: If one were planning on running a server and/or doing a load of editing,\n: would you recomend submerging one-self's in NeXTSTEP or LINUX to prepare?\nWell, the only OS you would want to run a *real* server on would\nneed to be under some multitasking OS like Linux or Next, but you\ncan run simple (single level, multiplayer) servers on a DOS box.\nAs far as the editors go... we will probably release the Next and\na WIN95 version of QuakeEd.\n\n: Will it be possible to swim in Quake?\nYes.\n\n: Will a multi-player game be possible using a single computer\n: playing split-screen, instead of needing a network?\nNo.\n\n: You mentioned peer to peer will work by having one machine act as\n: server and client. Will this give any advantage to either machine in\n: terms of performance?\nThe machine acting as client and server will suffer some, but\nnot a lot.\n\n: Will there be flying in Quake? If so, will it be controlled like\n: Heretic/Hexen (fly up/down) or like descent (fly where you point)?\nThere will be a lot of tossing and involuntary leaving the ground:)\nBut there probably won't be any sustained flying.\n\n: Will quake support/use math co-pros.\nNo.\n\n: Is the software required to run a server included in the game?   Will it be\n: present in the shareware version in one form or another?\nYes. Yes.\n\n: How is Quake looking in comparison to DN3D?  Is Apogee making you sweat as\n: much now as they did releasing Blake Stone on the eve of Doom's release?\nHahahah.\n\n: Are any of Trent's sound FX going to revolve around the \"piggy\" theme that\n: is so prevalent in his music?\nSo far they have not, but we will have to wait and see. We have\nnot put any restraints on him... the sfxs are his deal.\n\n: Will there be fog in Quake?\nNot in Quake. Next game.\n\n: Also, will it be possible to QUICKLY kill people (one shot in the back,\n: point blank)?  Will there be body part-specific damage?\nYes and yes.\n\n: would quake client/server run under win95? i mean, using winsock32 and\n: win95 based calls.\nYes.\n\n: if i can have 2 machines networked locally, which one should be running\n: quake server?\nThe faster machine.\n\n: would i be able to run quake server in win95?\nYes.\n\n: Will \"Quake\" have any moving light sources?\nNo. The engine is not set up for things like this.\n\n: Will Quake have full support for the Logitech Cyberman?\nYes, we will include the \"hammer driver\" with Quake so that\nyou can smash the shit out of your CyberMan and by a real controller.\n\n: Will you be able to tell what weapons / armour / artifacts a guy\n: is carrying (before he gets a chance to use them)?\nYes.\n\n: 1st - Will there still be \"voice support\" through the network.  i.e.\n: speaking through a mic and the people \"closest\" to you can hear\n: you while the people furtherst away might faintly hear you or not\n: hear you at all.\nThis will be in there soon.\n\n: 2nd - How will the support be with the VFX1 virtual reality helmet?\nIt will be great. Don't worry.\n\n: 3rd - Can damage be inflicted to certain areas of the body  i.e. if I\n: hit someone in the left shoulder, will they be knocked back in that\n: area?  Will they bleed from that area?\nYes, they will show the damage in the area where you hit them.\n\n: 1.)  Will Quake support 16bit or 24bit color modes?\n16bit under DOS and you can get 24bit under other OSs.\n\n: 2.)  Will Quake be a native Win95 app?\nThere will be a version of this, yes.\n\n: What Operating System will Quake come out for first?\n: DOS? Win95?(Not that Win95 is an OS) Linux?\nDOS, Linux, WIN95, NeXT, IRIX, and maybe more.\n\n: What Operating System will the server Software run under?\n: Unix? Linux? Sun?\nAll of the above.\n\n: What special fees will be involved in running a Quake Server?\nWe have not decided on how this will work yet.\n\n: I read somewhere that all level editing/creating would be done\n: through text (indicating object, coordinates, texture, etc.) to\n: make it easier for people to create level editors. Is this true?\nLevel editing is done in a CAD-like program that we created,\ncalled QuakeEd. When creating objects in the world that you\ninteract with though, you program these in QuakeC.\n\n: Could you tell us a little bit more about how the\n: character animations are done?\nKevin Cloud created monsters/characters with Alias and\nthen animates them and generates frames. The frames are\nthen played back in the QuakeC code whenever the character\nattacks/moves etc...\n\n:  In \"quake\", will the water be maybe deeper, and to make it more\n: realistic, will walking/wading through water slow you down?\nYou will be able to go underwater in Quake.\n\n: Will ammunition be a light source (e.g. fire a rocket and it lights up\n: the corridor as it flies)?\nNo.\n\n: Will there be support for I-glasses and other *TRUE*\n: stereoscopic headsets?\nYes.\n\n: Just out of curiosity...Has id thought about setting up it's own quake\n: network (national, or, in any case, big and public)?\nWe are thinking about this.\n\n: How will the differentiating of other quake players in deathmatch\n: be incorporated? Will we have a charatcer editor for the DM?\nThey will be different colors, or they will have a new skin.\nYou can edit the skins with any paint program that will load\n.lbms.\n\n: 2) Will the DOS version run faster than the Linux version,\n: or vice versa?\nThey will be about the same.\n\n: I herd a rummor that Quake would be ported to Linux like\n: Doom was.  Is there any plans for this or possible plans?\nYes. We love Linux and there will be a Quake version for it.\nWe are hoping that people will realize that Linux is the\nway to go if they want to set up a proper Quake server\nmachine.\n\n: Question 1) Will it be possible to cause environmental damage, such as\n: taking out entire walls in a firefight?\nNo.\n\n: Question 2) Is it possible to dismember enemies?  ie, if I don't like\n: someone's head (or other portion of their physionomy) can I cut it off?\nYes.\n\n: Will \"quake\" be a doom-like slugfest or will you ( and them) be harder to\n: kill then just one blast?\nCome on. Do you want to *wait* to kill someone by pounding on\nthem with a stick for a while... or do you want to shove a\nshotgun under their chin and watch their brains hit the ceiling?!\nSlugfest.\n\n:    Will there be outdoor landscapes that are really spread out\n: like a huge grass area or forest or some kind of terrain, or is it mostly\n: within the castle sorta thing?\nMostly indoors.\n\n: ah yes, i almost forgot.. will quake use wads of some sort? or will\n: everything be in an external file?\nSounds and qc files will be external. Maps and textures will be in\nwads, although we are not calling them that now:)\n\n: Can you move, pile up, or stand on top of dead bodies? Heheheh\n: (alt.games.quake)\nYes, these things are already in there and quite funny.\n\n: How long do we have to wait for the editor to be released?\nUntil the game is released.\n\n: Can we leave markings on walls (bullet holes)?\nNo.\n\n: You keep mentioning \"next game\" for new features...does this\n: mean Quake II or a different series?\nThis means the next game engine after Quake.\n\n: On the experience part I just wanted to add that it would be nice to be\n: able to save a character and play with him throughout the gamer's\n: QUAKE experience.\nThis is something that we intend to have in there. It will\nbe very cool when playing with persistent servers.\n\n: 1)\tWill there be a shareware release? and when?\nYes. When it is finished.\n\n: 2)\tWhat actions can be performed? eg: Running, climbing, rolling,\n: crouching, jumping, leaning etc.\nRight now there is jumping and leaning... there will be\nclimbing (maybe).\n\n: 3)\tI know that heads can be cut off, what about arms, legs, torso's etc.\nDepends on the creature you are attacking. Basically you cannot\ndo this all the time to all creatures (too many frames) but\nwe are going to make sure you can do this sometimes.\n\n: 4)\tAre you guys still supporting the Verite Rendition card? What about\n: Lockheed & Martin's Cards.\nWe are supporting the Rendition card. All others cards will be\nable to be added later by others.\n\n: 5)\tWill there be Day and Night? Weather effects?\nProbably not... but we will see.\n\n: 6)\tStill able to sacrifice to the Daemons???\nOf course.\n\n: 7)\tHow much interaction with the environment will there be?? like moving\n: boxes, smashing things, leaving marks on the environment (burn marks from a\n: spell say for instance)\nWe are not sure yet... depends on how much we think it adds\nto the actual gameplay once it is in... these things sometimes\nlook cool the first time but then get to be old after a while.\n\n: 8)\tAre your 3D polygon character models as detailed as the models in\n: Triton's Into the Shadows? (The guys hair and tunic moves!! V-cool!)\nThey are pretty detailed. ITS and Quake are two totally different\ntypes of games though... it is not fair to either product to make\nthese comparisons.\n\n: 9)\tI know you've said there will be no shadows from the characters, but\n: come on, if Into the Shadows can manage Multiple shadows, Why not Quake???\n: What specifically is stopping you from implementing them. Without them the\n: characters dont look like they belong in the scene if ya know what I mean?!\nSee above.\n\n: this is prolly a stupid question, but will I be able to play quake\n: over a regular modem with a friend, without a server/client deal?\nI will do some explaining for those of you who do understand how\nthis is going to work. The client is the machine that you will\nbe playing the game on. It is the machine that all the graphics\nget drawn by, and all your input goes into. The server is the\nmachine that takes care of all the difficult computations\nneeded in order to create realistic environments like the ones\nin Quake. When running Quake on one PC you are actually running\nboth the client and the server on the same machine. There are\na few different combinations that Quake will allow when it comes\nto this though... you could 1) play single player with the client\non one machine and the server on another. 2) play multiplayer with\nthe clients on different machines all over the place and the server\non a separate machine or 3) play multiplayer with the server running\non one of the machines that is also being used as a client. In\neffect, one of the guys is going to use his machine as the server\nfor everyone else (including himself) and the client for himself.\nSo... in your situation you could do this two ways: 1) you could\nset up the server for the game and your client on your machine\nand have your friend call you or 2) you guys could set up a separate\nmachine with two modems in it and you both call it to play. (there\nare other combinations but I think you get the idea.) Whew... lot's\nof text and I bet that made no sense at all :)\n\n: 1.In previous DOOM DOOM2 etc. each computer had to have a copy of the\n: wad(pwad) file to play a homebrew level(s). Will it be possible in\n: Quake to Xfer levels between computers or at least from the server\n: to play a game? This would be a welcome feature for playing over the\n: net and also LANs.\nWe are working on a way to include all the sounds/gfx in the\nwad file so that each wad file contains it's own gfx palette\nand sounds... this way you have one file that contains everything\nand you could potentially transfer this file to a server. This code\nis not in there yet, and we may not put it in there ourselves,\nbut it would not be hard to add.\n\n: 2.Will their be some sort of a licence site (for a LAN) / package?\nThere will be, but we are not sure about how it is going to work\nyet.\n\n: Are you going to create a dynamic outdoor setting, too?\nThe game is better suited to cool indoor areas, but you could\ndo outside areas also. We are thinking in terms of levels\nthat everyone out there can play, and so we are trying to\nmake sure that the levels we create have a good balance\nof coolness/speed. There should be some nice outdoor areas\nin Quake.\n\n: Okay, you may not want to release direct info on the server hardware\n: requierements right now, but i am wondering how many users will a Server\n: running on a Pentium 120 (with enough mem) will be able to support? (A\n: rough number at least)\nWe honestly do not know yet. We have been running some servers\non a P90 and we have hooked in around 9 clients without any slow\ndown at all. The max number is not really known yet... but I think\nit will be pretty high.\n\n: Also, assuming people are playing on a server via 28.8K modems, how many\n: users can there be in the game before the game strts getting slugish?\nAgain, we do not know about this. Modem code is not finished\nyet and we have not set up a machine with a ton of modems in\nit yet to test this. It will be pretty high though.\n\n: First, I assume the Quake version for win95 will incorperate directdraw,\n: and all those neat goodies. Will it run faster on a win95 platform as\n: opposed to DOS or LINUX?\nIt will be about the same speed.\n\n: Will it be possible to kill enemies, gain experience for that, and thus\n: grow in power and hp's?\nThis is something that will be possible in DeathMatch, but we\nare not thinking about doing in the actual game. We will\nsee.\n\n: What controller would you recommend when this comes out?\nRight now we are all using Logitech three button mice, but\nsomething cooler might come along before we release.\n\n: How much longer after the DOS release will the Win95 release be?\nThey should come out about the same time. The DOS version we have\nnow will run fine under WIN95 though.\n\n: Will it be possible to hide in the shadows of a corner and thus jump\n: an enemy from behind and crush his skull in?\nYes.\n\n: Is this going to be a CD-ROM game, and if so what kind of speed would\n: you be looking at?\nNope. CD-ROM does not == action.\n\n: Will it be possible to record a game ie: doom lmp's?\nYes.\n\n: Will Quake support the Microsoft Sidewinder Pro, especially the swivel\n: feature?\nFor those of you asking if we are going to support x or y please\nunderstand something: We are writing Quake in such a way that\nwhen we release it the manufactures of these products will be\nable to quickly and easily add support for their products. Chances\nare that many of the cool people out on the net will be writing\nmost of the device drivers for all the cool add ons you want.\n\n: The thing that facinates me about quake is its 3D aspect.  Will you provide\n: true floor over floor design and will the outside environment be realistic?\nFloor over floor is already in there. Has been since the beginning.\nOutsides will be cool.\n\n: What color depth will Quake run in?\nRight now the only depth we are sure of is 8bit. It may ship\nwith the ability to run 8, 16, 24... but we are not sure.\nIt does not matter because the only thing that looks better\nthan 8bit is 24bit, and it is not that big of a difference.\n(This is all under DOS) If you are running under Next you\ncan get 24bit and Linux can get 8 or 16bit.\n\n: I would like to know just how much freedom will quakeC give me.\n: Will it be like a suped dehacked, where all I can do is make new\n: levels monsters and weapons.\nIn QuakeC you will have control over all objects in the world\nsuch as doors, players, weapons, monsters, items etc... This means\nyou could totally reprogram any one of these things from scratch\nor just make minor modifications if you wanted to. You could\nalso turn Quake into a new game with some modifications to\nthe QuakeC and with some changes in the actual C code. (We are\ngoing to release as much of this as we can).\n\n: you mention that QuakeEd will be released w/\n: Quake but for creating objects that you interact with\n: you will need to program in QuakeC.  Will you then\n: also release a QuakeC compiler?\nAll you need to edit QuakeC is a text editor. The QuakeC will\ngo out with the game in the same form that we are working on\nit here. The compiler is built into the game and compiles the\ncode every time you run the game.\n\n: If you w/ a fast puter and somebody w/ a slow puter\n: are loged into the same Quake server, will you be able\n: to run/shoot faster than him?\nThe guy with the fast computer will have a higher frame rate\nand he will get more updates to the server than the other guy...\nin effect he will have an advantage, but on the other hand if\na dork with a slow computer joins a game where everyone is playing\nwith extremely fast systems and connects he will not cause everyone\nelse to slow down.\n\n: 1.) will quake be so advanced that other software companies will\n: not be able to claim that their game is \"like-quake, only better\"\n: or will the engine be easily cloned within a year after the\n: initial release?\nI refuse to answer these types of questions on the grounds that\nI want to say something like \"Quake will smash the shit out of\nall other games... and other game companies pee on themselves.\"\nIf I say things like that I get flamed by other game companies...\nand besides, it's not \"professional\" :)\n\n: 2.) will the quake engine be licensed for other games?\n: possibly a DOOM 3?\nOf course.\n\n: 3.) do you guys realize how freaking anxious all of us are for\n: the release?\nUh, no. Really? I've only gotten 200+ pieces of mail in the\nlast 12 hours!\n\n: How will the auto-mapping be handled?\nThere probably will be no automap.\n\n: How will lmp recording be handled? The same as Doom or from room\n: cameras or something different?\nSame as in DOOM, although it would not be hard to get cameras\nin there.\n\n: Will there a weapon that is as satisfying as\n: the Doom shotgun/super shotgun..\n:) Wait and see.\n\n: What will be the minium modem speed?\nProbably 9600bps.\n\n: If you have run Quake with a 3d accelerator yet, what is the\n: performance improvement estimate?\nIt is great. I will get the exact specs from Michael in\nthe morning... something like 640x480 at 30+ fps.\n\n: About how many enemies/level?\nThis is not something we are going to release yet.\n\n: What do you plan to do to defend Quake against products like D!zone?\nKill. :) Not sure yet.\n\n: When 3D characters were used in games like fade to black and alone in\n: the dark, player control was compromised because the character could\n: not stop on a dime, if he was in the middle of a step, he would\n: complete his step first.  What is Quake's position on this?\nWe have always hated shit like that and we will not\nallow something that \"looks cool\" to destroy the overall\nfun of the game.\n\n: 1.  If I have a network setup between a couple of comps in my\n: apartment, can someone call in on my modem (with my comp as server)\n: and join in the mayhem?\nYes.\n\n: 2.  Are the levels gonna be interconnected... and if so, how would\n: this work in DM?  Say I wanted to pound somebody but I couldn't\n: find them.\nYes they are, but you will be able to specify whether\npeople can go to the next level or not. It will depend\na lot on the type of OS you are running. If the OS\nis multitasking and can run more than one server at a time\nthen when someone leaves a level it can either, take everyone\nwith that guy... or spawn a new server with that level on it\nthat would then run side by side with the current level.\nThis could obviously cause problems if everyone went to\ndifferent levels, but there will be ways to control how\nthis works.\n\n: 3.  Is the Hell Spawn Matrix Death Cube '95 (tm) still in there, or\n: is there going to be a similar object in the game?\nNot sure now.\n\n: 4.  Is voice going to be incorporated in games run over modem?\nIf the modem will support it. We are not going to try to\nget this into the code though.\n\n: 5.  Ponder this:  I've got a network of 8 comps... say the server is\n: a P-100 with 16 megs o ram running win95.... slow or fast net game?\nShould be ok.\n\n: 6.  On the day that Quake is released, is the Internet going to see\n: its biggest shutdown since RTM's worm?  If so, can I stop by Id's office to\n: copy the shareware version? :)\nHeh... what do you think? Crash bitch! Crash!\nYeah, we would *love* to see all our fans here at the office\ntrying to get copies of the game the day we release... I think\nthe building would crash :) Would not be so bad if all our fans\nwere gorgeous super models of course...\n\n: \tWill I be COOL if I play Quake?\nNo, you will be cool if you suck my... anyway.\n\n: 1) Dead bodies as armor (i.e. use your dead buddy as a shield from\n: bullets)?\nThis would be pretty funny... we will see.\n\n: 2) Multiple games with different configs (i.e running three quake server\n: on one one computer for the novice, the moderate, and the psychopath)?\nThis is working now.\n\n: 3) Can characters build shield/shelters from raw material objects in the\n: game (i.e. hold up box in front of chest to keep from getting blasted in\n: the chest)?\nNo.\n\n: b)Would modifying the source slow it down at all, or is it compiled BEFORE\n: runtime on the server?\nYou can modify the source while the game is running but the\nchanges will not take effect until the progs are reloaded... but\nthis is something that you can do on the fly. Basically you would\ntell the server to reload everything, the game would freeze, but\neveryone would stay connected... once the progs were reloaded\n(if there were no bugs in your code) things would continue with\nyour changes.\n\n: c)Can the anti-christianity stuff be kept to a minimum?\nWho says that is Jesus anyway?! That could just be Bob or something.\n\n: d)Will cross-platform netquake be possible with big endian and little endian\n: machines playing together?\nThis will not be a problem. We are already doing it.\n\n: Will it be easy(no c coding involved) to configure a large group DM\n: session so that players do not respawn?\nThis would be *very* easy, but you would have to know how to\nuse QuakeC, which is much like C.\nYou would take this code:\n\tif (!self.button1)\n\t\treturn;\n\tself.deadflag = DEAD_RESPAWNED;\n\t...\nand make it this:\n\tif (!self.button1)\n\t\treturn;\n\treturn;\n\tself.deadflag = DEAD_RESPAWNED;\n\t...\nHe would then never come back.\n\n: 1) I remeber hearing that you guys were designing a new protical for\n: games on the internet.  What's the status of this?\nCarmack is still working on this.\n\n: 2) Does the concept of a \"god person\" still apply?  Can a person change\n: the game play environment during an actuall net game?\nYes.\n\n: Will you be able to drop/hand-off weapons/items (that other players can\n: pick-up)?\nNot on purpose, but if your buddy buys it right next to you\nhe will drop all the shit he was carrying and then you\ncan pick it up. (or you could leave it for him so he\ncan come back and get it... nah, fuck him.)\n\n: By customizing my character's 'skin' with a wall texture, will I be able\n: to hide (in a chameleon like way) by just standing still against a like\n: wall (and then pop out and kill the f%&ker)?\nUh... yeah... I had not thought of that one. You guys suck.\nI can just see it now... a bunch of dorks running around the\nlevels in \"wall texture camo\" going \"Where is everybody?!\"\n\n: Please, oh please, can you give us to ability to eat a slain opponent,\n: thereby gaining health & maybe his magic power? (or just for fun)\nTrent already did some good bone crunch/gut rip sounds that we\nare planing to use just for this. Who cares if it helps your\nhealth or not... it will be fun to kill someone and then take\na bite out of their face for good measure. :)\n\n:Once \"Quake\" is ready for release, will you then announce a release date,\n:or will it just suddenly appear on an FTP site somewhere?\nHehe. This is a good question, but we are not sure yet.\nSomething like 1... 2... 3... release! Crash!\n\n: You mentioned \"involuntary leaving the ground\". Is it possible to knock\n: someone off a cliff with a hammer blow to the back, or (even more fun)\n: can you throw people? :-o\nYou will not be able to throw people, but all weapons\nwill impart some velocity to the \"victim\". If the weapon\nis strong enough it will make him leave the ground. (We\nhave managed to get dead bodies to fly up into supports\nacross the ceiling:)\n\n: Can you aim your weapon to a specific body part. Like aim for an\n: knights weapon arm. Or are you stuck with a top right to bottom left\n: swing (assuming close combat weapons)?\nThis is DeathMatch, if you spend that much time trying to hit\nsomewhere specific you will be dead.\n\n: If you can aim your attack is it possible to block an oppents attack by\n: swinging at it? (Clash sword against sword)\nThis will not be in there.\n\n: Assuming close combat weapons, will the length of the swing affect the\n: damage? Short swings low damage but quick recovery. Long swings slower\n: but deadly.\nNot going to happen.\n\n: Will the user interface be as customizable as the rest of the program?\nYes.\n\n: You said that characters show damage on specific body parts but will it\n: impair them? Would a wounded leg decrease running speed?\nWe are thinking about this, but we are not sure if we like the\nidea or not yet. We will try it out and if it is cool it will\nstay, if not it will end up in some other companies game.\n\n: 1) Does the framerate max out, and if so, what is the maximum?\nNot right now. Probably will not.\n\n: 2) Is there support for external 24-bit models / sprites?\nModels already are.\n\n: 3) What sound formats are supported (i.e. Qsound, ProLogic, etc.)\nAnything that someone wants to write support for.\n\n: 4) What is the minimum requirement / recommended system?\nUhg.\n\n: 5) Will there be a version of Quake optimized for the P6?\nFor the Pentium yes, P6 probably not.\n\n: 6) What will the primary distribution format be?\nNot sure yet.\n\n: 7) About how much disk space will Quake require (game, drivers, swapfiles)?\nShould not be much more than DOOM.\n\n: 8) Will specifications be released before the game so that editors and\n: other levels can be released concurrently?\nYES.\n\n: What 3D acceleration chipsets does ID like?  Which will y'all support?\nRight now the only thing we are playing with is the Rendition.\nThere will be others, but we cannot comment on this right now.\n\n:   You stated that you would make QuakEd available for Win95 and NexT.\n: What about us Linux users?  You were talking about how much you loved it\n: and everything, so I was hoping you could be persuaded to port it to\n: Linux too.\nIt would be cool to have a Linux version... but we do not have\ntime to do it. I am sure that once we release the source those\ncool Linux Gods out there will have an editor ready for you in\na matter of minutes.\n\n: 3. Can we add different death frames to the guys? (like a new type of\n: death.. e.g. die of poisoning)\nYou will be able to add new ones easily and there will be several\nin there when we ship the game.\n\n: 5. I can't wait to see the swimming.. can you drown?  (attach weights to\n: your opponents..<evil grin>)\nWe are still working on this. I do not think we will have drowning,\nbut there will be some cool things happening when you kill a person\nin the water. (bodies float to the surface etc...)\n\n: Also.. you've been letting all these comments about\n: Quake possibly having modern elements (like rockets) sorta slide..\n: not gonna  elaborate??\nHehe. Not going to elaborate. Nope.\n\n: Anyway, you mentioned that in Quake you WOULD be able to get\n: experience for killing other people. Does this mean that you could\n: just beat up on newbies all day and end up powerful enough to beat a\n: better player?\nNo, you get points based on the skill of the guy you\njust killed. Newbies would give you little or no points\ndepending on how the server was set up... and some servers\ncan be set up not to allow newbies or American-Like-God\nplayers on in order to keep things fair.\n\n: Several versions of DOOM were public betas.  Heretic had a public\n: beta.  Hexen had a public beta.  So why can't you release a Quake beta?\nWe are working on something.\n\n: If I understand well, only the guy in control of the game server would be\n: able to change the game on the fly i.e. change player characteristics, new\n: weapons, new artifacts...?\n: Isn't that unfair to those players who are connected as clients and have no\n: control over the game whatsoever? Or am I wrong ? (as usual ;-)\nYes, this could be unfair if the guy you are playing with is\na cheating monkey... but we are working on a way of flaging\na server that has been messed with. So you should be able to\ntell if your \"buddy\" is cheating or not.\n\n: \" This means that you can run 640x480 at high frame rates.\"\n: Does this apply to all decent video cards, or only those with 3d\n: accelerators?\nAccelerators only.\n\n: \"1) play single player with the client\n: on one machine and the server on another.\"\n: Would this increase game speed in anyway?\nIn most cases it would only increase the speed a little.\n\n: Plain and simple can we expect anything for christmas, I don't care what\n: just something to look at; screen shots, animation, picture of your mom :)\nI will post a picture of my mom for you guy on Christmas :) No, I will\ntry to make sure that you guys get some sort of Christmas present.\nThis DOES NOT mean we are going to release the game or anything,\nbut maybe some new screenshots/info/something.\n\n:   : I have read that it will be possible to actually edit maps\n:   : while \"live action\" is taking place.\n:   This will not be possible.\n:   : 2) Does the concept of a \"god person\" still apply?  Can a person\n:   : change the game play environment during an actuall net game?\n:   Yes.\nThis did not make sense to some of you. What this means is that\nyou cannot change the level itself, but if you were a God person\nyou could have control over what was going on in a level. You\ncould spawn a monster behind a guy, make people freeze in place\nso that everyone else can beat on them etc... pretty much any\n\"God Tool\" that you can imagine could be created and used on the\npeople on your server... but you cannot make a new wall appear or\nanything that deals with changing the physical structure of a level.\n\n:   Lastly, will there be any OS/2 support.  You mentioned a few times that\n: a server required a \"real\" OS for multiple levels.  Have you tested any\n: code under OS/2?\nWe have not tested any code under OS/2, but I am sure someone out\nthere will create a port for us once the game is out.\n\n: How exactly does the aiming work in quake?\nJust like it did in DOOM. Point and click. Instant blood.\n\n: Is there an invisibility sphere, beserk box etc as from Doom?\nNo, we have not put anything like these two items in, but\nwe are working on new items that should replace them.\n\n: Someone asked if you could make\n: barriers and you said no, but you could make a fort with dead bodies\n: couldn't you?\nNo, because there is no way to move dead bodies around other than\nshooting them. There is no way to make them stack.\n\n: On skin textures, couldn't you just make your skin transparent or is this\n: somehow disabled?\nYou could not make your skin transparent because we do not have\na transparent color available to those polys.\n\n: Do you guys have any hardware plans, it was mentioned some time ago that\n: you might be making headsets, is that still in the works, are you guys\n: working on releasing a real controller for us?\nWe are not working on any hardware right now. If we do anything it will\nbe to find a nice controller that we are all using and put some\nkind of id stamp on it.\n\n: Will all player characters essentially be the same, or will there be\n: different types as in Hexen?\nThe same.\n\n: I loved the fact that you could drink the blood in Wolf3d when you were\n: under 10% health, will there be any sort of pools of blood around dead\n: bodies in which you could do the same in Quake?  Or will there be any\n: other vampiric elements in it?\nI am working on some vampiric weapons right now. We will see how they\nwork out.\n\n:  o  Ok, I saw that you did not have plans to port QuakeEd for Linux.\n: Oh man, that hoortz like you can't imagine.\nCome on... once we release the source code the Linux community will\nhave this huge race to see who can get the coolest/fastest\neditor out there. Don't worry about this.\n\n:  I know you're using Alias to build\n: your models but how will we define our *own* 3D objects?\nWell, you could either use Alias, or use some other 3D editor\nand then use a converter to make the model data what it needs to\nbe.\n\n: I have heard that due to a Limitation of BSP builders, the view will not be\n: able to \"tilt\".  That is, tilt from side to side, or rotate.\nWe have tilt working.\n\n: Ok, so the server has been hosting a deathmatch for 2 days straight, with\n: players coming and going. Thousands of body parts are piling up.\n: ...Things are looking a little cluttered.\nBodies enter a queue just like in DOOM. After there are a certain\nnumber of them on the level they will start to decompose and\nthen finally dissapear.\n\n: 1) Has the 'Quake' engine been optimised (sorry - I'm British) optimized for\n: Pentium processors ?\nYes.\n\n: Would ID consider producing a virtual world - something like\n: the virtual world in 'Snow Crash' - with virtual towns, roads, bars, clubs,\n: bikes, cars etc etc etc ?\nWe are not going to do this, but YOU could easily set your server\nup like this. This would be a sort of virtual MUD. People could\ncome on, look around, talk to each other. They could submit an\napplication for a room and you could tack one on for them in\nthe editor and then reload the server when there are not many\npeople on. Stuff like that. I am making sure that everything you\nwould need in order to do this will be included in the game.\n\n: 3) Do you get christmas off ?\nWhat's Christmas?\n\n: You say you eventually will support the mac. How eventually (third party\n: 2 years after the initial release kind of support?)\n: If you support it, what about quickdraw 3d acceleration?\nWe know the MacDOOM stuff took a long time. We will try to make\nsure the same thing does not happen with MacQuake. Not sure what\nthey are going to utilize in order to make it happen.\n\n:      I understand you will be doing the Sony Playstation version\n:      yourselves\n:      - will this be a cool as the PC version?\nWell, no. But it will be worth playing.\n\n:      - will deathmatch play be possible?\nYes.\n\n:      - will it be released within a reasonable time of the PC version or\nHopefully.\n\n: Linux is repeatedly mentioned as the server platform of choice for a\n: PC owner with a couple of friends to kill. If there's going to be a\n: CD version of Quake, what about putting a standard Linux distribution\n: (Slackware, Red Hat, Debian, whatever) on it?\nWe are thinking about this.\n\n: Also, you said that it would be possible to write the QuakeC code\n: to have a player be one of the baddies.  Will it be possible to\n: edit a DeathMatch code to where everybody is playing an entirely\n: different creature?\nYou could do this.\n\n: Will future versions of your software support anything other than\n: IPX networks (ie. Internet TCP/IP) for multiplayer games or will\n: be forever be stuck with third-party products like Kali?\nWe already have Quake running with TCP/IP and IPX.\n\n: have you seen the Into the Shadows demo of the 4 polygon-texture-mapped\n: characters and how does it compare to Quake?\nStop sending us shit about ITS. Yes, we have seen the demo, yes it was\ncool, no we don't give a shit about it. Quake will rule. There\nis no comparison between these two games. Besides, no one has even\nseen anything more than the ITS demo, and there is no telling what\nthe actual game will be like. The same goes for Quake. Let's start\ncomparing them when they are out.\n\n: You mentioned there would be no realtime shadows in quake: does that mean\n: the ones in the screenshots you released are pre-rendered? Doesn't that\n: take a whole bunch of space?\nNo, we mean that there will be no *moving* shadows. Everything you\nsee in the screenshots came directly from our screens to yours.\n\n\nI am answering the last questions in my mailbox and then that\nis it. Any new mail that I get today I am going to start deleting.\nI know I said I would do this until Friday, but I have gotten\nvery little done in the last few days except for answering all\nthese questions. Please understand that I would like to keep\nanswering all of these, but I just can't. Thanks.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n\n********\nTHERE IS NO BETA VERSION OF THIS OUT *ANYWHERE*!\nTHERE IS NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO TEST EITHER.\nWE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.\n********\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nStatus of DOOM---Updated: Fri, Jul 28th 3:22pm\n\nWe have mastered The Ultimate DOOM! *This is out in stores now*.\nThere is a patch for registered DOOM owners that will turn your\nDOOM into Ultimate DOOM for free.

I really want to answer all the\nquestions you people are sending... but there are\ntoo many. Since I started this thing I have recieved\nover 350+ pieces of mail... 10 more while I am writing\nthis! I cannot work on Quake and answer all these questions\nall day long. I know you guys want them answered so\nhere is what I am going to do... I will stop taking\nnew questions right now and finish answering the 160\npeices of mail I still have not gotten to. Once that\nis done I am going to have to call this off. Don't be\nmad... be happy. This means I can get back to work\non Quake and have it out on time. :)\n\nThe reason that Quake will not be released until Spring:\nWe are making sure that this will be the coolest game\nyou ever saw. Nothing more than that.\n\nThings that work:\nJust about everything.\n\nThings we are working on:\nSpeed, monsters, actual game play :), more\nweapons, figuring out some way to have all\nthe people who send us mail bugging us about\nQuake run over by a truck. Joystick code,\nitems, environmental hazards, etc...\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nNetwork Play:\nWe have DeathMatch! (This is really why we are delaying the\nrelease... we have been playing DM too much.)\nRight now we can start up a game with n players and\nrun around killing each other all day long. You\ncan leave the game, and then jump back in whenever\nyou like (as long as the server is still running.)\nDeathMatch right now is great, and it is going to\nget even better. We have found the replacement for\nDOOM DeathMatch... finally :)\n\nEngine:\nAll VESA resolutions are now in. Video hardware support\nis in and working for some cards now. This means that\nyou can run 640x480 at high frame rates. I mean *high*\ntoo. The engine is just about done. There is not much\nmissing from it now. Textures and modeling are rock solid.\nAt this point we are working on the game itself and the\nengine details... minor but important stuff.\n\nMap Editor:\nCarmack just rewrote the editor to allow us more\nflexibility while designing levels. This took some\ntime, but it was worth it. We are now able to\ndo things that were once impossible with the old\neditor.\n\nDone picking on Munchkin.\n\nPlease stop sending Quake questions.\nI cannot keep answering them... it is taking\nway too much time. I know I said I would do\nthis until Friday... but there is no way I can\nkeep this up.

Set up a Quake server on\na NeXT, Linux, or SGI box. Once the server is running you\nget on another machine (NeXT, Linux, SGI) and log into the server.\nA play window opens and you can see the other players, move around,\nquit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but this\nwill be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc, will\nbe added in later.\n\nBasic Engine:\nThis is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,\nbut this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single\nplayer.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the\nengine.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200\npolygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we\nwould need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail\nwe want. So far this is the only \"thing\" in the game. He does not\nanimate, but it is still cool to watch him be \"born\". At the moment\nhe is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.\n\nMap Editor:\nJohn also has a map editor in the works. At this point it looks\nsomewhat like 3D studio, with a camera view and a top down view\nof the thing you are working on. You can add and subtract blocks\nof \"material\" from the view. These are the building blocks of the\nworld... No, you will not be limited to blocks in the finished game.\n\n**We will not be adding anything new to this for a while.\nThere are MANY cool new things going into the game right now, but\nwe do not want to give it all away just yet. We have been creating\nsmall test levels for the past few weeks, and these are looking\nawesome. The general game idea has started to solidify, but please\ndo not write asking what it is.\nI will add some new stuff here when there is *alot* more to add.\n\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IS id?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

It uses converted\nDOOM maps and runs them with flats for textures. It looks REALLY\ncool.\nOk, imagine this. You have a health thing and you don't need it.\nYou meet someone in the game who has a nice weapon but is really\nlow on health. You guys decide to exchange items. You don't really\ntrust this guy so you bring along a friend and tell him to hide out\nsomewhere with a bead on the other guy's head. You meet somewhere\nin the middle of a field and face off. You drop your health, he drops\nhis weapon and you both strafe over the object of your desire. You\nstart to back away (not turning your back on him) and suddenly decide\nyou're going to whack this guy before he gets a chance to use that\nhealth. You move towards him and draw back with your hammer. He notices\nthis and starts to duck, but it's too late. You smash him in the head\nand watch him fly down to the ground, landing on his side. You smash\nhis still body a few more times and cause him to explode! Now you and\nyour friend pick up all of the items your dead friend left on the\nground. As you are walking off you pick up his severed head and put\nit in a bag. That will come in useful later... when you need something\nto sacrifice to a demon.\n\nJohn has a faster engine working now. Groundwork for network play\nhas been finished. Looking VERY cool. For those of you who still\nhave a wife, kids, a job, and a life after DOOM, this game is for YOU.\nYou DOOM junkies will have a new fix...\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAQ to help@idsoftware.com\n_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_\n\nWHAT IS iD?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

There will be NO MORE. We are aware that the Ensonic\ndoes not work with DOOM or DOOM ][. There is nothing we can do\nabout this. The only difference between 1.7 and 1.7a is the tech\nsupport number at the end of the file. You should still upgrade to\n1.7a just to make sure you can play with all your friends.\nThere will be a German and French patch out soon for those of you\nthat have the foreign version.

Tue, Nov 15th 11:30am\nid is working closely with a young and tender software company to\nproduce a roleplaying game based on the DOOM engine. This budding\ncompany is in need of a programmer. You must be proficient at\nobjective C, familiar with NextStep, and easy to get along with.\nSkill in programming is, of course, essential, but _even more\nimportant_ is a good work ethic and attitude.\n\nSend your resume to american@idsoftware.com. We expect lots of\nreplies to this *alas*, so if you don't hear from us, we decided\nthat, after a long and distressing discussion, that you were\ntragically overqualified or something equally heartwarming.\n\nIt is a point in your favor if you are skilled at DeathMatch, but\nit is NOT, repeat NOT, necessary. Please don't include your skill\nat DeathMatch in your resume -- if we decide to fly you out for an\ninterview, your DeathMatch qualities will be tested at that time.\n\nI AM ONLY ACCEPTING **RESUMES** PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANYTHING ELSE\nIN REGARDS TO THIS.

It just slows us down.\nThanks.\n\nWell, we just got sprite 'models' animating with frame changes and rotational\nchanges totally moved over to the client. The server is runnin' really well\nnow!  There's a really cool Pain Barrier (and Health Field) that just looks\ngreat with animating and rotating sprites. Um, and yes, there are sprites in\nthe game - for very good reason: there's not an amazing level of detail to\nbe had in a total polygon environment.  Sprites are faster to render and\nbesides, they make great torch holders!  They also look cool for magical\neffects!\n\nProgramming the entities in the game is one of the most amazing and\nrewarding parts of Quake development.  You program in Quake-C (.qc) and the\ninstant you save your file, you tell Quake to reload and parse it. It\ntakes about 1 second.  Then, you get to see your changes implemented right\nthen - and that's while you're programming in a C-like language! No compiler\nin the middle; instant execution.  Too cool for words.\n\nThere. I just wanted to add something new for QuakeTalk. :)\n\n****\nYou can find screenshots of some of our Quake stuff\non ftp.idsoftware.com in /idstuff/quake.

Set up a Quake server on\na DOS, NeXT, Linux, or SGI etc... box. Once the server is running you\nget on another machine (DOS, NeXT, Linux, SGI, etc) and log into the\nserver. A play window opens and you can see the other players, move\naround, quit out, get back in, etc... Deathmatch is working a little\nnow and we can run around and shoot each other with fireballs.\n\nEngine:\nThis is running very fast. We have completed some really great\nlooking levels that we are running around in. The lighting is\ntoo good to believe. There are doors/plats/switches/etc... in\nthe game now.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin is working on creating the monsters/players and Michael\nis making them draw really fast. These are looking great. Sprites\nsuck compared to proper models.\n\nMap Editor:\nThe map editor is completely finished. We have been working with\nit for a while now, creating new levels.\n\nPlease do not send us mail about Quake.

Man, what a 'tard.\nOk, ok... you guys wanted more.\nAs of today the following things are working/semi-working:\nNetwork play\nBasic Engine\nObject Modeling\nMap Editor\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nNetwork Play:\nServer/Client code is functioning great. Set up a Quake server on\na DOS, NeXT, Linux, or SGI etc... box. Once the server is running you\nget on another machine (DOS, NeXT, Linux, SGI, etc) and log into the\nserver. A play window opens and you can see the other players, move\naround, quit out, get back in, etc... There is no DeathMatch yet, but\nthis will be the first part of the game to be working... monsters etc,\nwill be added in later.\nThis is still the same. There have been no changes.\n\nBasic Engine:\nThis is running pretty fast. In network mode it slows down somewhat,\nbut this will be reversed soon. (Network will be faster than single\nplayer.) Right now we are using a part of DOOM map 1 1 to test the\nengine.\nThis is running faster everyday. We are using other maps to test on\nnow and things are looking very awesome.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin created a model of a person that only consists of about 200\npolygons. This model looks surprisingly good... we had thought we\nwould need more polygons per model to create the amount of detail\nwe want. So far this is the only \"thing\" in the game. He does not\nanimate, but it is still cool to watch him be \"born\". At the moment\nhe is textured with the art from the CyberDemon.\nWe have a couple of different monster and person models now.\nThe all look very good.\n\nMap Editor:\nThe map editor is completely finished. We have been working with\nit for a while now, creating new levels.\n\n**We will not be adding anything new to this for a while.\nThere are MANY cool new things going into the game right now, but\nwe do not want to give it all away just yet. We have been creating\nsmall test levels for the past few weeks, and these are looking\nawesome. The general game idea has started to solidify, but please\ndo not write asking what it is.\nI will add some new stuff here when there is *a lot* more to add.\n\nRead alt.games.quake for occasional new info.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nWHAT IS id?\n\n1id \\'id\\ n\n[NL, fr.

The knight chases you around and\nslashes at you with his sword and the ogre has a huge axe and\na missile attack.

Deathmatch is working a little\nnow and we can run around and shoot each other with fireballs.\n\nEngine:\nThis is running very fast. We have completed some really great\nlooking levels that we are running around in. The lighting is\ntoo good to believe. There are doors/plats/switches/etc... in\nthe game now.\n\nObject Modeling:\nKevin is working on creating the monsters/players and Michael\nis making them draw really fast. These are looking great.

You can set/unset any of these options.\n* The new style of mouse movement will set the standard for all future\n        action games; it's that amazing.\n* All options are totally changeable, while you play the game. You\n        want to increase your normal walking speed threshold to the running\n        speed threshold, no problem. (This means that you won't have to hold\n        down a 'RUN' key, it will always be running! The RUN key can be used\n        to slow you down if you want.) This works with any controller used\n        with Quake.     Everything can be changed in real time.\n\nSony PSX DOOM: The very best version of DOOM on the planet. All music and\nsound effects have been totally trashed and new ones created. It feels like\nyou are playing a movie.  This should really be Sony's flagship product. It\nshould be out when the PSX is released.\n\nSNES DOOM: Will be out September 1st.\n\nUltra64 DOOM (3?): The character models are completely amazing.\n\nMacUltimate DOOM: We're working on getting it done.\n\nHexen: Beyond Heretic (H2): So damn cool. The very best game in the\ncurrent crop of DOOM-clones.  It slams everything out there; very dark,\nvery eerie and the audio/visual feedback is totally and completely immersive.\nScreen shots to be released soon.\n\nStrife: Screen shots to be released soon.\n\n---\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| John Romero (romero@idsoftware.com) id Software                   |\n| Send questions about id software to help@idsoftware.com           |\n| ftp.idsoftware.com                Official id anonymous FTP site  |\n| www.idsoftware.com                Official id Web site            |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nOooooh, you're fingering me again.\n\n"}]
